By the respondents’ case, this was based on the understanding that ICS’s dues to Affert were settled. IHBV also injected about US$100m into ICS to rejuvenate ICS’s plant and operations. Again, by the respondents’ case, IHBV was only willing to pay a total of US$50m to acquire an entity (that is, ICS) that was free of related-party debts. Thus, if Affert had not issued the 7 October Letter, IHBV says that “it would have taken this into account in its negotiations with Senfer and priced the Acquisition accordingly”.

This is because it was only in the 7 October Letter that the relevant sum of US$17,277,886 had been set out. Therefore, in so far as Affert refers to that sum, it was only made known to ICS in the 7 October Letter. As such, the subsequent relevant issues need to be considered bearing in mind that the alleged waiver is contained in the 7 October Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Additionally, as a matter of terminology, when I refer to the 7 October Letter, I mean the arrangement that the parties had reached pursuant to it.

In this regard, Affert argues that it is “undisputed” that the 7 October Letter falls within the definition of a “transaction” under s 2 of the BA. Section 2 of the BA provides that a “transaction” includes “any gift, agreement or arrangement”. Since a waiver is really the giving up of a chose in action, Affert argues that there is “no reason” why such a waiver would not constitute a “transaction” as defined in the BA.

Indeed, the respondents submit that the 7 October Letter does not “waive” a debt of US$17,277,886 owing by ICS to Affert. In fact, there was no such debt of “US$17,277,886” since it is undisputed that the amounts unpaid in respect of the six invoices concerned is only US$17,007,263.60. Moreover, the respondents say that, as of 7 October 2014, US$7,437,349 of that amount was already time-barred.

Thus, the respondents say that Affert was merely issuing a written confirmation to ICS regarding ICS’s dues, which Affert knew that IHBV would also rely on.

Apart from the definition of a “transaction” in s 2 of the BA, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mercator</span>, taking some guidance from the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Taylor Sinclair (Capital) Ltd (in liquidation); Knights v Seymour Pierce Ellis Ltd </span>[2001] 2 BCLC 176,<span class="font-italic"> </span>held (at [23]) that the word “transaction” encompasses a wide range of possible meanings. Chao Hick Tin JA observed that while the word “transaction” ordinarily means a “dealing”, it could also mean anything that passes between the parties. However, Chao JA did not agree with the English High Court that a transaction should be narrowly defined to refer to a contract or a mutual dealing. Instead, the learned judge thought (at [24]) that since a gift (which is a unilateral act), came within the definition of “transaction” by virtue of s 2 of the BA, a simple payment (which is at least indicative of a gift), should fall within the meaning of a “transaction”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the subsequent Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Dexia Bank NV </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 154 (“<span class="font-italic">Velstra</span>”), the court considered (at [22]) that the plain meaning of the phrase “entered into a transaction with any person”, as it appears in s 98(1) of the BA, connotes “mutual dealings, and that the counter party is one with whom the insolvent party wishes to deal”. In reconciling this with the court’s prior holding that a gift falls within the s 2 definition, Chao JA in <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>opined (at [23]) that “a gift is perhaps an express statutory exception to the mutuality rule”. After referring to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mercator</span>, Chao JA affirmed (at [33]) that “for a transaction to fall within s 98, the counter party must be a person to whom the donor party intends to make the payment, or pass the property”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 7 October Letter is a “transaction”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Applied to the present case, I do not agree with the respondents that the 7 October Letter is merely a representation that does not rise to the level of a “transaction” within the meaning of s 2 of the BA. Before me, Mr Cavinder Bull SC (“Mr Bull”), who appeared for the respondents, submitted that only a representation, and no independent agreement, arose out of the 7 October Letter. In my view, this argument ignores the wide definition of “transaction” in s 2 of the BA, which also includes an “arrangement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Further, in the 7 October Letter, Affert “[confirms] that [it] will not in future dispute or make any claim on ICS or its subsidiaries for any sort of dues to [Affert]”. This is as much a representation as it is a transaction. The transaction is contained within Affert’s representation not to make any claim on ICS for any sort of dues to Affert. Indeed, by the clear terms of s 2 of the BA, this is plainly an “arrangement” between Affert and ICS for the former not to make any claim on ICS for any dues to Affert. This conclusion is also consistent with <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span>. In fact, it is clear from Affert’s representation that it intended to deal with ICS, being the relevant counterparty mentioned in the 7 October Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As such, I conclude that the 7 October Letter plainly constitutes a “transaction” under s 98(1) of the BA. This therefore requires me to go on to consider whether the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On this key issue, Affert argues that the 7 October Letter was entered into at an undervalue as its terms did not provide for Affert to receive any consideration for the waiver.

In this regard, Affert argues that, in conducting the value comparison exercise under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA, the court must undertake the value comparison exercise from the perspective of the grantor, which in this case would be Affert. Also, the value of the consideration must be quantifiable in monetary terms, such that abstract or intangible forms of value that cannot be quantified in monetary terms have no place in the value comparison exercise. Finally, where the value of the consideration is precarious or speculative, evidence will be needed to establish and quantify its value in monetary terms to undertake an objective exercise. With these principles in mind, Affert submits that it had received no consideration from the respondents that is quantifiable in monetary terms or otherwise. Indeed, Affert points out that the respondents have not been able to state definitively that Affert had received any benefit which may be quantified in money or money’s worth, in exchange for the waiver.

Instead, Affert stood to benefit significantly by issuing the 7 October Letter and by IHBV proceeding with the Acquisition. More specifically, the respondents submit that Affert did not give up anything of value by issuing the 7 October Letter because Affert was not going to pursue the claims against ICS. Also, by 7 October 2014, nearly half of Affert’s claims for the ICS Debt had become time-barred and the remaining US$9,569,914.60 would have become time-barred soon after. In addition, US$1,120,837 of the remaining US$9,569,914.60 was payable in respect of a shipment between Affert, ICS, and Transfert FZCO (“Transfert”). Later, Affert, ICS, and Transfert entered into a Deed of Termination on 24 March 2015 for a full and final settlement in relation to this shipment. It would therefore be unfair for Affert to recover moneys from ICS when Affert had not paid Transfert, and when Affert, ICS, and Transfert had settled their matter on the basis that Affert would not claim such moneys from ICS.

This is because Affert would have known that IHBV was obliged to cause ICS to pay US$9m to Senfer’s order under the Side Letter if all of ICS’s related parties provided written confirmation that ICS’s dues were settled. Thus, Affert’s confirmation by way of the 7 October Letter led ICS and IHBV to believe that ICS’s dues were settled. It was only under such circumstances that IHBV proceeded to make payments in respect of the Acquisition and ICS made payment of US$8,001,856 to Senfer’s order. Affert would consequently have benefitted from the infusion of funds into the Archean Group.

In that decision, Steven Chong JCA laid down two key points in relation to the comparison of value provided for under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA. First, the value comparison exercise must be undertaken from the perspective of the grantor, that is, the insolvent individual or company. The learned judge pointed out that this approach coheres with the general policy of s 98 as a whole, which is “to protect the interest of the general body of creditors against a diminution of assets brought about by a transaction which confers an unfair or improper advantage on a particular creditor of the company” (at [25], citing <span class="font-italic">Mercator </span>at [27]). Therefore, the material comparison is between the value received by the grantor and the value provided by the grantor, as opposed to the value received and/or provided by any other party. Relatedly, what matters is the <span class="font-italic">actual </span>value received and provided by the grantor, rather than the grantor’s perceived value (at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BA requires both the value of the consideration provided and the value of the consideration received by the grantor to be assessed “in money or money’s worth”. Chong JCA observed that when the relevant consideration is received by the grantor in the form of money, the assessment of its value will generally be straightforward. However, when the relevant consideration is received in money’s worth, there may be some difficulty in the assessment of its value. In this regard, the value of the consideration must be quantifiable in monetary terms, even if the precise monetary value of the consideration cannot be immediately determined with certainty. The learned judge explained (at [34]) that this is needed so that the value of the consideration provided and received by the grantor can be meaningfully compared on the same footing. This would further the policy object of s 98, which is to protect the grantor’s assets. As such, abstract or intangible forms of value that cannot be quantified in monetary terms are of no value to the grantor’s creditors upon its insolvency and are irrelevant in the value consideration exercise. Finally, where the value of the consideration is precarious or speculative, some evidence will be needed to establish and quantify its value in monetary terms in order to undertake an objective comparison.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With these principles in mind, and for the reasons that I will now develop, I conclude that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As a preliminary point, the value comparison exercise should take place by considering the benefit provided by Affert in money and the benefit received by Affert in money’s worth. This is because while the alleged waiver that is provided by Affert can clearly be measured in monetary terms, the benefit received by Affert (if any) are mostly indirect and intangible, and hence must be measured in money’s worth. As such, I will also undertake the value comparison exercise by examining: (a) the value Affert provided by the 7 October Letter in money; and (b) the benefit Affert received in return for issuing the said Letter in money’s worth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The value Affert provided in the 7 October Letter</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 With these observations in mind, it is useful to begin the value comparison exercise by ascertaining the monetary value that Affert provided in the 7 October Letter. In this regard, Affert argues that it had provided value by the 7 October Letter by waiving the debts that the respondents owed under six invoices, which I set out in this table:

In this regard, article 301 para 2 of the OHADA Uniform Act on General Commercial Law (“UA”) provides that the relevant limitation period for a commercial sale is two years. In turn, article 234 para 1 of the UA defines “commercial sale” as “contracts of sale of goods between merchants, natural persons or legal entitles, including contracts for supply of goods intended for manufacturing activities or production”. This is to be read with article 235 of the UA, which sets out exceptions to the definition of “commercial sale”.

</div> In the present case, the six invoices issued by Affert to ICS concern the sale of sulphur, which are commercial sales that do not fall within any exception in the UA. As such, unless the two-year limitation period can be suspended or extended, it will apply to the invoices here from the date at which their underlying debts became due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Affert’s expert (“Ms Bebohi”) says that the total debt as contained in the invoices is not time-barred for two main reasons. The first reason is that the respondents have acknowledged the debt, which under OHADA law, interrupts the limitation period. On Affert’s case, the alleged acknowledgement is contained in an internal IHBV email dated 17 September 2014 (the “17 September email”).

On this point, I agree with Mr Houda that there was no acknowledgment of a debt in the present case. The email was not sent by ICS to Affert and also did not mention any invoices.

Again, both parties’ experts agree that where partial payment is made, it will refresh the unexpired limitation period if the payor expressly connects the partial payment to an invoice. In this regard, Affert contended that ICS had made partial payment towards Invoice 1, which concerned the vessel “<span class="font-italic">MV Xenia</span>”. Mr Adrian Wong (“Mr Wong”), who appeared for Affert, pointed me to Affert’s ledger account for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012, which shows an amount of US$1,737,652.62, received in respect of “<span class="font-italic">MV</span><span class="font-italic"> Xena/MV Saadet</span>”.

</div> Mr Wong contends that this represented a partial payment for the invoice in question. However, as Mr Bull rightly points out, the payment was in respect of “<span class="font-italic">MV</span><span class="font-italic"> Xena</span>”, which is a different vessel from “<span class="font-italic">MV</span><span class="font-italic"> Xenia</span>”, the subject of the invoice in question. Mr Wong has not alleged that the ledger account contains a typographical error in this regard. As such, Affert has not shown a connection between the sum of US$722,569.68 and Invoice 1. The limitation period for this invoice was therefore not restarted and expired on 19 July 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, I consider the question of the date on which the Solvadis Invoice was due, which bears on the question of when the limitation period started to accrue, and therefore, affects when the limitation period expires.

Thus, payment for the Solvadis Invoice would have been due on 4 October 2012. As a result, the limitation period for the Solvadis Invoice expired two years later, on 4 October 2014.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I therefore find that when Affert produced the 7 October Letter, two invoices had become time-barred, namely, (a) Invoice 1, which became time-barred by 19 July 2014; and (b) the Solvadis Invoice, which became time-barred by 4 October 2014. Accordingly, out of the total debt that ICS allegedly owed Affert, only US$9,569,914.60 was not time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The Deed of Termination</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I turn next to the Deed of Termination, which concerns the Transfert Invoice. It is undisputed between the parties that Affert, ICS, and Transfert signed a Deed of Termination dated 24 March 2015.

The Transfert shipment was a cargo of bright yellow granular sulphur that Transfert had sold to Affert. Affert had failed to make full payment to Transfert for the cargo, due to ICS’s own failure to pay Affert for the cargo. In order to resolve the difficulties, all three parties (Transfert, Affert, and ICS) entered into a full and final settlement under which they agreed that Affert and ICS would be jointly and severally liable to pay Transfert a sum of US$5,674,313.09 (the “Settlement Agreement”).

</div> Yet, Affert now claims that it is owed a debt of US$1,120,837 in respect of the Transfert shipment from ICS, after subtracting part payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my judgment, Affert cannot claim a debt of US$1,120,837 from ICS because the Settlement Agreement has terminated this debt. While there is no express termination of a debt owing by ICS to Affert in the Settlement Agreement, I find that recital (i) of the same document amounts to an implied termination of such a debt. This is because recital (i) provides that all three parties desired to fully and finally settle “all claims or other matters” arising from the Transfert shipment. The phrase “other matters” can conceivably include any claims that Affert has against ICS. Indeed, the ultimate result of the Settlement Agreement, which is that Affert and ICS jointly and severally agreed to pay Transfert a settlement sum, would only make commercial sense if Affert has also waived any claim it had against ICS. Otherwise, it is difficult to see why ICS would agree to be jointly and severally liable to pay Transfert the settlement sum, while still being liable to Affert for the same. ICS would only have agreed to do so if its liability was only to Transfert, and not Affert. If this is the effect of the Settlement Agreement, then it is clear that Affert has no further claim arising from the Transfert shipment against ICS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the alternative, I find that even if ICS’s liability to Affert in relation to the Transfert shipment survived the Settlement Agreement by somehow being subsumed thereinto, that liability would have been extinguished by the Deed of Termination. This is because clause 2.1 of the Deed of Termination provides that the Deed is “in full and final settlement of all Claims by any Party against any other Party arising out of or in connection with the Settlement Agreement”.

Apart from the fact that the BA does not require the court to inquire into whether Affert subjectively intended to pursue the ICS Debt for the purposes of ascertaining if a transaction is at an undervalue, it is logical that the fact that a company’s former directors had not pursued or would not pursue claims should not lead a court to find that there was no transaction at an undervalue. Furthermore, as Affert points out, Affert’s financial difficulties in mounting a claim for the ICS Debt against the respondents should not be a bar to finding that a transaction is at an undervalue, since a claimant is required to be insolvent to make an application under s 100(2) of the BA in the first place.

This is because the ICS Debt was, based on the objective evidence, very unlikely to be recoverable. As such, the actual value of the debts may well be significantly less than their face value (see, in this regard, Kristin van Zweiten, <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode on </span><span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span>”) at para 13−29). Indeed, at the material time, it is undisputed that ICS was in grave financial difficulty and was nearly, if not, insolvent. Therefore, it is not likely that Affert could have recovered anywhere near the full amount of US$8,449,007.60 had they demanded repayment of the outstanding amounts. The difficulties in recovering the debts would have been compounded by the impending limitation periods. Accordingly, while the face value of the remaining invoices was US$8,449,007.60, I find that, had it been argued in this manner, it might have been appropriate to adjust this value downwards. However, to be fair to Affert, since the argument was not made on this premise, I do not make such a downward adjustment in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Accordingly, I find that the value Affert provided in the 7 October Letter is US$8,449,007.60.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The valuable consideration that Affert received in exchange for the 7 October Letter</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I now turn to the next stage of the valuation exercise, which requires me to determine the value of the consideration received by Affert (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, the consideration of whether Affert received valuable consideration should be approached by way of two analytically distinct steps.

Second, I will then calculate the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of that consideration that Affert received (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There are several advantages with approaching the valuation exercise through these two steps. First, it maintains the conceptual clarity of the concept of “consideration”, which, as Chong JCA in <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>held, has the normal meaning ascribed to it by the law of contract (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span> at [24]). After all, in the law of contract, the court does not generally inquire into the adequacy of consideration (see Andrew Phang and Goh Yihan, <span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore</span> (Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2021) at paras 221−222). Thus, it is incongruous with the principles of contract law for a court to have to look for “valuable consideration”. Instead, it may be more accurate to speak of the court <span class="font-italic">identifying </span>consideration first, without assessing its value, save where the value is said to be <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. Second, this approach readily accommodates the possibility that the consideration could have accrued to another party who was not the insolvent company (or “grantor”) (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [26]). This is achieved by separating the identification of the consideration (wherever it may have gone) from the exercise of calculating the value that accrued to the grantor (in this case, Affert) as a result of that consideration. In contrast, a composite inquiry of whether the grantor received “valuable consideration” risks inadvertently missing out on any consideration that may not have flowed directly to the grantor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Identifying the consideration that Affert received</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 With these principles in mind, I now turn to <span class="font-italic">identify</span> the consideration that Affert received in exchange for its 7 October Letter, if any. When the 7 October Letter is considered in the context of the Acquisition, it is clear that Affert received consideration in exchange. It is not disputed that ICS paid US$8,001,886 to Archean Group entities pursuant to the Side Letter, as part of the Acquisition. In particular, ICS paid (a) US$5,418,000 to Mineral Trade Group FZE (“MTG”) on 15 October 2014, (b) US$1,078,095 to MTG on 17 October 2014, and (c) US$1,505,791 to Senfer Investments Limited, Jersey (“Senfer Jersey”) on 21 October 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this regard, I find that the respondents have shown practical benefits accruing to Affert arising from the 7 October Letter. This is because the 7 October Letter paved the way for the payments to the other Archean Group entities, and taken holistically, Affert must have received practical benefits from this infusion of funds into the Archean Group. For the purposes of contract law, it is relatively clear that a practical benefit accruing to a contractual party can constitute consideration (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong Fook Chee Vincent </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 250; the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Williams v Roffey Bros</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd </span>[1991] 1 QB 1). This practical benefit can arise in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the broader corporate group being kept in funds, facilitating the continued survival of its constituent companies. In this connection, the courts are quite ready to find the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of such consideration (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic"> Pacific Resources Ltd v Tomolugen Holdings Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1049 at [15]), which, I reiterate, is a distinct inquiry from the <span class="font-italic">valuation</span> of that consideration. Therefore, I disagree with Affert’s argument that the respondents have been unable to particularise or substantiate the supposed benefits received by Affert. Rather, Affert’s accounting documents show that it had significant business dealings with various Archean Group entities that received payments from ICS and IHBV as part of the Acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 First, Affert’s account documents show that it had significant business dealings with MTG. As such, Affert would have received a practical benefit from MTG being kept in funds to continue such business dealings. While such a practical benefit may be characterised as precarious or speculative, the respondents have raised tangible evidence towards the existence of such a benefit objectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Second, Affert’s account documents show that it had significant business dealings with Senfer Jersey, and that Senfer Jersey was indebted to Affert. As such, Affert would have received a practical benefit from Senfer Jersey being kept in funds to continue such business dealings and having the moneys to repay Affert. In particular, it appears from Affert’s Statement of Affairs (“SOA”) that Senfer Jersey incurred debts of S$5,347,323 to Affert as of 18 September 2017.

However, there is a distinction between requiring that the benefit be <span class="font-italic">capable</span> of quantification, as opposed to requiring that the benefit be <span class="font-italic">actually</span> quantified with mathematical certainty. In this regard, Chong JCA in <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span> seemed to have contemplated that a benefit could be capable of quantification while not being calculated with exactitude, when he stated that “the value of the consideration must be <span class="font-italic">quantifiable in monetary terms</span>, even if the precise monetary value of the consideration cannot be immediately determined with certainty” [emphasis in original] (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Therefore, in my view, I am only required to decide the following in relation to the comparison exercise. First, whether the value given and received by the grantor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the insolvent individual or company – in this case, Affert) is <span class="font-italic">capable </span>of valuation. Second, whether the incoming value is significantly less than the outgoing value. It is therefore not a strict legal requirement for me to ascribe a mathematical value to either the incoming or the outgoing value, as long as I am able to conclude whether the former is or is not significantly less than the latter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I am solidified in my view that numerical exactitude is not required by the approach that various cases, both local and foreign, have taken. Starting with the local cases, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Theme Corp Pte Ltd and another </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Buildspeed</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>”) ascribed a range of values to the profit margin that the grantor had given up as a result of the impugned transaction (at [37] and [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Some English cases have likewise approached the valuation exercise without requiring numerical exactitude. The case of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Thoars (decd) (No 2); Reid v Ramlort Ltd (No 2)</span> [2005] 1 BCLC 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span>”) concerned s 339 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“UK Insolvency Act”), which is almost identically worded to s 98 of the BA. The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>observed that there is nothing in the express words of the provision “which requires the court to ascribe a precise figure either to the outgoing value or to the incoming value”. Rather, the court can make a finding that the transaction was at an undervalue if it is “satisfied that, whatever the precise values may be, the incoming value is on any view ‘<span class="font-italic">significantly less</span>’ than the outgoing value” [emphasis in original] (at [103]). The approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Mortgage Corporation plc v Woodward and another </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Agricultural Mortgage Co</span>”) also affirms this view. It concerned s 423(1)(c) of the UK Insolvency Act, which empowers the court to make orders to reverse a transaction that a party has entered into “for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by himself”. The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Mortgage Co</span> did not appear to have identified any numerical figure, or even a range, for the value accruing to the grantor. Instead, it simply found that the grantor had incurred a “very substantial detriment” under the transaction, as his value of his freehold interest in the farm was diminished by “more than £500,000” (at 9). The Court then concluded that this was “<span class="font-italic">far</span> greater in value, in money or money’s worth than the value of the consideration provided by [the second defendant]” [emphasis in original] (at 11). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 From a practical perspective, it is clear why the value comparison exercise cannot always require numerical exactitude. After all, valuation exercises necessarily contain a margin of error due to various factors such as the valuation method used, especially where they concern projected or future business activity. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>, the profit margin on the remaining uncompleted construction work that the grantor gave up was expressed as a range of values due to the difficulty in predicting contractors’ profit margins generally. The High Court explained, citing an expert report, that it had to do so because of the variance in calculating profit margins caused by “the wide range of accounting techniques, methods of paying directors and other factors” (at [37]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span>, the English Court of Appeal considered the minimum value granted by the grantor (£10,000, at [115]), and the minimum value accrued to the grantor (“not substantially less than £3,000”, at [120]). While it may be preferable for a court to arrive at precise figures for the incoming and outgoing value “<span class="font-italic">in those cases where it is able to do so</span>” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span> at [105]), this does not compel a court to conclude that no value was provided to the grantor in cases when it is not possible to arrive at such precise figures. In such cases, the court is entitled to take a rough-and-ready approach to estimating the difference between the value provided by, and accruing to, the grantor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Having set out the relevant principles, I now consider their application to the facts of the present case. I have already accepted that the 7 October Letter resulted in a practical benefit to Affert through an injection of funds into its various business partners and debtors in the Archean Group. The practical benefits can be grouped into: (a) continued business activity with those business partners, and (b) an increased likelihood that those companies would repay their debts. I accept that these benefits could be capable of valuation. However, as I explained above, I also need to consider whether the incoming value is significantly less than the outgoing value (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the value comparison exercise). In my view, this is where the respondents face some evidential difficulties. To begin with, the respondents have not led expert evidence as to the valuation. This is in contrast to the other cases, such as <span class="font-italic">Buildspeed</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ramlort</span>, where expert evidence was adduced for the estimations in the valuation exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Turning to the question of continued business activity, it is difficult to establish the exact value of this practical benefit. While the various ledger entries and accounting documents disclose multiple transactions between Affert and its business partners ranging into millions of dollars, the evidence is still insufficient for me to even begin estimating a value to this benefit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The same applies to the increased likelihood that Senfer Cyprus and Senfer Jersey would repay their debts to Affert. It is true that the respondents have adduced evidence as to the exact debts owing from these companies to Affert, including advances that Affert had paid to them.

</div> While it might be argued that this could serve as a starting point for a rough-and-ready calculation as to the value that Affert received, the difficulty is that the value accruing to Affert from these companies’ increased likelihood of repaying their loans is not coterminous with the entire quantum of these loans. Indeed, the value Affert derived from an increased likelihood of Senfer Jersey and Senfer Cyprus repaying their debts is less than the value Affert would have derived if these debts had been discharged in their entirety. Based on the evidence before me, it is not possible to estimate a value to this benefit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Therefore, I find that while the practical benefits accruing to Affert could be capable of valuation, the evidence before me does not permit me to determine or even estimate that value. In the round, it is telling that the respondents themselves have not provided a numerical figure, or even a range of figures, that can form the basis for estimating the value that Affert received. Given the lack of expert and documentary evidence, coupled with the respondents’ failure to attempt a valuation of the benefit that Affert received, it is not open to me to conjure up a valuation of that benefit on behalf of the respondents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For completeness, I do accept the respondents’ argument that they are not privy to the internal arrangements of the Archean Group and could not have known how the moneys transferred to the Archean Group as a result of the 7 October Letter were used.

</div> That said, I must make findings on the basis of the evidence that is presented to me. Therefore, despite accepting that the respondents may have faced genuine difficulties in obtaining the necessary evidence, I must still find that they have not managed to value the benefit that Affert received. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Value comparison exercise </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 From the foregoing, the value that Affert gave up as a result of the 7 October Letter was US$8,449,007.60. However, for the reasons above, I find it difficult to even estimate the value that Affert received. More importantly, I do not have sufficient evidence before me to decide that the value that Affert received was likely less or more than the value that it gave up. Accordingly, I am compelled to find that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue. However, without making a definitive finding on this matter, I do consider it possible that had the appropriate evidence been adduced before me, the value that Affert received could have been comparable to (or in excess of) the value that Affert gave up, as a result of the 7 October Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Given my findings above, I go on to consider whether, assuming that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue, it would be appropriate to make the Payment Order sought by Affert for ICS and IHBV to, jointly and severally, pay to Affert the ICS Debt. For the reasons I will develop, I do not think that it would be appropriate to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Given that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue, whether it is appropriate to make the Payment Order</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 To begin with, Affert argues that the Payment Order is appropriate because it was deprived of a debt and should therefore be made whole with such an order. It further submits that the Payment Order is appropriate because: (a) ICS was a direct counterparty to the alleged waiver; (b) IHBV was also a party to the alleged waiver and/or also benefitted from it; and (c) the alleged waiver was procured jointly by ICS and IHBV.

In sum, the respondents say that even if Affert did not issue the 7 October Letter, it would still not have pursued the ICS Debt before it became completely time-barred. The Payment Order is therefore not restorative.

This is consistent with the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lord v Sinai Securities Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2005] 1 BCLC 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Sinai Securities</span>”), which Affert cited, in which Hart J held as follows (at [15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court’s primary, and possibly only, concern under s 238(3) [of the UK Insolvency Act] is the restoration of the company’s position: the position of the counter-party needs to be considered by the court as a general matter of discretion, but the court is not obliged to ensure that his position is restored in every particular to the status quo ante the transaction. There will be many cases where that is simply impossible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 238(3) of the UK Insolvency Act provides that “the court shall … make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into that transaction”. This is similar to s 98(2) of the BA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In light of this similarity, I find the English High Court’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span>, where Park J considered the appropriate orders to make in relation to a transaction at an undervalue under s 238(3) of the UK Insolvency Act, to be persuasive. In that case, the company and a partnership had sold their businesses and assets to a third party on the basis that they were each to be paid a share of the consideration. However, the company was promised a share that was substantially lower than the value of its business and assets. Correspondingly, the partnership was promised a share that was substantially higher. Park J held that the sale of the company’s business and assets was a transaction at an undervalue. Yet the learned judge refused to grant the liquidator’s request for orders of payment, being the amount that the company would have received if the consideration was not split with the partnership. Park J explained his reasons as follows (at [123]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If IM Ltd [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the company] had not entered into the transaction with Farlake [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the third party] (the hypothesis which s 238(3) requires) I believe that it would have had to close down its business, so it would not have been able to receive anything for it. It is of course true that IM Ltd would have been better off if it had entered into a transaction of sale to Farlake but without the feature whereby the consideration was split between itself and MDA partnership. <span class="font-italic">However, the section permits me only to restore the position to what it would have been if IM Ltd had not entered into the transaction at all: it does not permit me to reconstruct the position to what it would have been if IM Ltd, as well as not entering into the actual transaction, had entered into a different transaction instead. </span>On the facts of the case, although I consider that IM Ltd did not get full value for what it parted with under the actual transaction, <span class="font-italic">it would have been in </span><span class="font-italic">an even worse condition if it had not entered into the transaction at all</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In other words, <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(as applied in the Singapore context)<span class="font-italic"> </span>makes clear that, pursuant to the plain wording of s 98(2) of the BA, a court must simply restore the position to the <span class="font-italic">status quo ante</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>without going further than that to reconstruct the position to what would have been. To do the latter would be to speculate what the insolvent company would have done. This would not be right. Rather, the plain meaning of a “restorative” order is to restore the insolvent company’s position to what it was before the transaction at an undervalue had taken place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 However, Affert submits, first, that I should not follow<span class="font-italic"> </span>the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span> because Park J’s comments were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.

</div> I do not accept this argument. Since the approach in <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is the subject of substantive arguments in the present case, I can come to a considered decision as to whether to follow that approach or not. Put differently, the fact that Park J’s comments were <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>should not prevent me from deciding whether those comments are correct based on the parties’ arguments before me. More broadly, it seems unsatisfactory for the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi </span>and <span class="font-italic">obiter dictum </span>distinction to be applied inconsistently, and raised only when it would apparently benefit one party. The distinction should be applied consistently to all cases that are cited in argument, or it should not apply at all. The distinction should not be used when it is only helpful to one party and certainly not, as is the case sometimes, to avoid making more detailed analysis on the substantive strength of an argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, Affert submits that, because most perishable assets would be spoilt or worth significantly less by the time the matter proceeds to court for determination, following <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span> would mean that payment orders for all transactions at an undervalue concerning perishable assets would be refused.

</div> From this argument, it appears that Affert understands <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span> as requiring that the assets be physically in existence at the time that the court makes the order. However, I do not read <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as imposing such a requirement. Indeed, other cases such as the English High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Arden and others </span>[2019] 2 BCLC 215 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”) make it clear that the court is not bound to restore the position to exactly that which existed prior to the relevant transaction or preference. Rather, it may make orders “<span class="font-italic">which in substance achieve that result</span> but achieve it in a different way” [emphasis added] (at [93]). In this regard, I do not think that Affert’s citation of <span class="font-italic">Sinai Securities</span> helps its case. The relevant proposition from <span class="font-italic">Sinai Securities</span> is that it may sometimes be impossible to restore the <span class="font-italic">status quo ante</span> and a court should not do so in those circumstances. However, where it is possible to do so, I do not see a reason in that case or more generally why a court should not do that. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The payment order sought is not restorative</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As such, I adopt the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span> in relation to what a “restorative” order means.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In the present case, this means that the court cannot reconstruct the position to what it would have been if Affert had, in addition to, not issuing the 7 October Letter, also actively pursued the ICS Debt before the applicable limitation periods expired. Therefore, even though I have found that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue, I decline to order ICS and/or IHBV to be jointly or severally liable to pay the ICS Debt to Affert. The setting aside of the 7 October Letter, which is what Affert has prayed for, does not necessarily mean that Affert would have pursued the ICS Debt successfully. As I will now explain, there are indications that Affert would not have pursued the ICS Debt in any event, or that even if it did, it would have been unable to recover the ICS Debt.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 First, I agree with the respondents that there is no evidence that Affert intended to or took steps to recover the ICS Debt,

In that case, the liquidator of Oxford Pharmaceuticals Limited (“OPL”) claimed that certain payments amounted to preferences of Masters International Limited (“MIL”) and Dr Masters, who was a shareholder of MIL, and who had guaranteed the liabilities of MIL and OPL to their bankers. Mr Mark Cawson QC, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, held that he did not have any jurisdiction to grant relief against Dr Masters as Dr Masters had at most received some incidental benefit as a shareholder in MIL. The learned judge said this (at [85]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the preference amounts, as it did here, to the payment of a sum of money to a creditor, then the obvious starting point to any relief is, as I see it, that the recipient creditor should be ordered to repay the relevant moneys.

If, which I do not consider to be the case, I have any discretion to grant relief against Dr Masters in these circumstances, I exercise my discretion against doing so given, in particular, the remedy that exists against MIL and the incidental nature of any benefit that Dr Masters might have gained.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>, the respondents, who were the former officers of a company in liquidation, applied to strike out the applicant liquidator’s originating application against them, or alternatively for summary judgment. The liquidator had alleged that the company officers’ conduct in declaring payment of a substantial dividend to shareholders amounted to a transaction at an undervalue within s 238 of the UK Insolvency Act and/or a preference within s 239 of the same Act. Thus, Judge Kyriakides had to decide whether, among other issues, s 238, s 239, and s 241 of the UK Insolvency Act limited the court’s jurisdiction such that it could only make an order against certain classes of persons (at [87]). Judge Kyriakides held that while the court had the discretion to make orders against third parties, such parties had to subsequently receive the property (whether they continued to hold it or not) or must have otherwise benefitted from the transaction (at [99]). The learned judge thus held that he did not have any jurisdiction to make an order under s 238 and s 239 of the UK Insolvency Act against a director of a company who had “received no benefit from the transaction or preference and whose only role was to direct the company to enter into the transaction or to give the preference” <span class="font-italic">as he has “not</span><span class="font-italic">hing to ‘restore’”</span> [emphasis added] (at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In response, Affert argues that there is no need for the third-party defendant to have received a direct and tangible benefit, citing the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Petrogat FZE and others </span>[2023] EWHC 44 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Integral</span><span class="font-italic"> Petroleum</span>”) to support its submission. <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span> concerned an application under s 423 of the UK Insolvency Act, which provides that where a person has entered into a transaction at an undervalue to defraud creditors, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into, and protecting the interests of persons who are victims of the transaction. In that case, the court found that there were transfers defrauding creditors under s 423 of the UK Insolvency Act made to a company (“Company A”). Significantly, David Edwards KC (sitting as a Judge of the English High Court) made payment orders not only against Company A, but also against the second to fourth defendants, even though they were not the immediate recipients of the impugned transfers. While Affert urges me to follow the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>I decline to do so as I read that case<span class="font-italic"> </span>as having been decided on its particular facts. In <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span>, Edwards KC drew a factual inference that the third-party defendants had directly and tangibly benefited from the impugned transfers to Company A, based on those defendants’ objectionable conduct (at [117]). This conduct included, among other things, refusing to identify Company A (in breach of court orders), thus making it impossible for proceedings to be commenced or for a payment order to be made against it (at [96] and [115(i)]), and refusing to disclose information regarding what happened to the funds transferred to Company A (at [115(ii)]), despite being the owners and operators of Company A (at [115(iii)]). As such, I do not think that <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum </span>greatly helps Affert’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Affert further argues, using the case of <span class="font-italic">Ailyan</span><span class="font-italic"> v Smith</span> [2010] EWHC 24 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Ailyan</span>”), that the court can make a payment order against a third-party defendant merely on the ground that that defendant has facilitated and procured an undervalue transaction.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Ailyan</span>, the trustees in bankruptcy of Mr Kevin Foster sought repayment of sums paid into a pyramid scheme dishonestly run by the respondents on the ground that these were transactions at an undervalue within the meaning of s 339 of the UK Insolvency Act (at [1]) (s 339 of the UK Insolvency Act being almost identically worded to s 98 of the BA). Some of these moneys were paid into a company called Infocus (Cayman) Ltd rather than the respondents’ bank accounts (at [20]). Supposedly, the court made a payment order against the respondents even though there was no evidence that the sum was received by the first to third respondents or that they had benefitted from the sum.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, this is not an accurate reading of <span class="font-italic">Ailyan</span>. Although the payments were technically made to Infocus (Cayman) Ltd, the English High Court found that <span class="font-italic">each of the respondents</span> <span class="font-italic">was a</span><span class="font-italic"> party </span>to the impugned transactions<span class="font-italic"> </span>(pursuant to which the payments were made) (at [47]). Simply put, because the respondents in <span class="font-italic">Ailyan</span> were counterparties to the relevant transactions, they were not third-party defendants.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 To sum up the discussion, the starting point is that an order under s 98 of the BA must be restorative (see <span class="font-italic">Re MDA</span>). To achieve this, what the court is effectively doing in many cases is to notionally set aside the transaction, though the power is not expressed in this way (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [95]). As <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>explains (at para 13−129), “the policy underlying most (but not all) of the avoidance provisions is to reverse unjust enrichment” and that as a result, the liquidator’s claim is to “recover the asset transferred or its value”. Seen in this light, the primary person against which orders should be made is the counterparty to the transaction at an undervalue (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [95]). In this regard, third-party defendants have “nothing to ‘restore’” (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [101]), and orders against them are therefore exceptional (see <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span> at [111]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Given that orders against third-party defendants are exceptional, I find it appropriate to set down the following principles to guide the court’s discretion when making such orders. For such an order to be made, it is not enough if the third-party defendant only facilitated or procured the transaction. Rather, the starting point is that the third-party defendant must be in possession of the property or moneys that were the subject of the impugned transaction(s) (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Oxford Pharmaceuticals</span> at [84]). However, the court can make orders against a third-party defendant if that defendant received a direct and tangible monetary benefit as a result of the transaction (see <span class="font-italic">Oxford Pharmaceuticals</span> at [84]), in place of a direct transfer of the moneys or property to that defendant. The threshold for finding this is high. As an example, one category of cases where courts have displayed a strong willingness to find a direct and tangible benefit is where the third-party defendant engaged in egregious misconduct (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Integral Petroleum</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The Payment Order should not be made against IHBV</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 With these principles in mind, I find that the Payment Order, if at all made, should not be made against IHBV. First, IHBV has never had a contractual relationship with Affert. Indeed, on Affert’s own case, only ICS and not IHBV was a “direct counterparty” to the alleged waiver.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-b6ef9444-e7dc-4e04-8af8-2d7658d297b4" data-toggle="modal" type="button">76</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this regard, the 7 October Letter speaks for itself: only ICS, and not IHBV, was a party to the Letter. At best, it might be said that IHBV was somehow involved in the alleged waiver by providing the funds to ICS to settle the related party dues owed to the Archean Group. However, such involvement is quite different from being a party <span class="font-italic">to the transaction</span>, which is founded solely on the parties to the 7 October Letter. This puts IHBV squarely in the category of third-party defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Second, IHBV did not benefit from the alleged waiver in a manner that justifies me making the Payment Order against IHBV. In my view, IHBV did not “need” the alleged waiver for the Acquisition to proceed. The commercial reality was that if Affert did not issue the 7 October Letter, IHBV would have just priced the Acquisition accordingly. It would not be commercial to expect IHBV to have proceeded with the Acquisition by paying the original price of US$50m, of which US$9m was conditioned on Senfer settling all the inter-company outstandings if there was no confirmation that these outstandings had been cleared. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Third, the profits and strategic benefits which supposedly accrued to IHBV are too far removed from the alleged waiver for these to constitute direct and tangible benefits. To begin with, the alleged waiver extinguished obligations that <span class="font-italic">ICS</span> owed to Affert. Since IHBV did not owe these same obligations, any benefit it received from the alleged waiver was necessarily indirect. As for the identified profits and strategic benefits, these (assuming they had materialised) arose out of the broader <span class="font-italic">Acquisition</span> rather than the alleged waiver. Therefore, they are essentially consequential gains to IHBV instead of tangible benefits resulting directly from the alleged waiver. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Overall fairness in the exercise of discretion</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For completeness, I deal with whether “fairness” is relevant in the context of s 98 of the BA. This question has arisen because the respondents invoke “fairness” in support of various arguments in their submissions. These include: (a) that it would be unfair for Affert to use the avoidance provisions to escape the applicable limitation periods,

</div> On the other hand, Affert argues that any consideration of “fairness” is beside the point because the “overriding concern [of the transaction avoidance regime] is to ensure the asset value is not lost in the run-up to liquidation, even if this causes hardship to a wholly innocent counterparty” [emphasis in original omitted], citing Roy Goode, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode, 3</span><span class="font-italic">rd ed</span>”) at para 11−67.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I first deal with Affert’s suggestion that the overriding or only consideration of the transaction avoidance regime is to preserve the company’s asset value. To my mind, the statement that Affert cites from <span class="font-italic">Goode, 3</span><span class="font-italic">rd ed</span> must be read in context. Specifically, this statement appeared in a discussion on whether the (common law) defence of change of position should or should not apply to a claim under s 238 of the UK Insolvency Act (see <span class="font-italic">Goode, 3</span><span class="font-italic">rd ed </span>at para 11−67). It was used to explain why the defence of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser (and by extension, change of position) is not, and should not be, available to a counterparty to the transaction under the Act. I therefore do not read <span class="font-italic">Goode, 3</span><span class="font-italic">rd ed</span> as proposing a blanket statement of policy or law with the intention of limiting the court’s discretion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Further, the general principle is that the assets available for distribution to the general body of creditors in liquidation are those owned by the company when it goes into winding-up or administration (see <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> at para 2−10). The avoidance provisions are the exceptions to this general principle. Thus, given that the policy objective of the avoidance provisions is to reverse transactions conferring an unfair or improper advantage on the counterparty (see <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> at para 13−03), it follows that considerations of fairness are not irrelevant under s 98 of the BA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Furthermore, from a statutory interpretation perspective, there is nothing in the plain words of s 98(2) of the BA that prevents a court from considering fairness. The provision merely gives the court the power to “make such order as it thinks fit”, without limiting the matters that the court may consider in deciding what order it should make.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Indeed, there is some precedent for a court to consider fairness (at least implicitly) in deciding <span class="font-italic">not</span> to order the reversal of a transaction at an undervalue. In this regard, the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Singla v Brown and another </span>[2008] Ch 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Singla</span>”) is instructive. In <span class="font-italic">Singla</span>, the trustee in bankruptcy for the first defendant (Mr Brown) sought to set aside a transfer by the first defendant to the second defendant (Mrs Malden-Browne) of 49% of the beneficial interest in a house, on the basis that this was a transaction at an undervalue within the meaning of s 339 of the UK Insolvency Act (s 339 of that Act being almost identically worded to s 98 of the BA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Given that Mrs Malden-Browne had not provided any consideration for this transfer, the court was “driven” to conclude that the transaction was indeed at an undervalue (at [26]). However, the Court decided <span class="font-italic">not</span> to set the transaction aside, on the basis of the broader circumstances surrounding the transfer. Just two months prior to the impugned transaction, Mrs Malden-Browne had received the opportunity to purchase the freehold in the house at a very substantial discount (over one-third of the freehold value). This opportunity was “hers and hers alone, nothing to do with Mr Brown” (at [61]). In this regard, Mrs Malden-Browne’s intention all along had been to purchase the property in her sole name, but the house was instead put into her and Mr Brown’s joint names because the mortgage company insisted on this (at [5]). As a result, the purchase of the property as joint tenants conferred a windfall on Mr Brown of half the value of the discount. The Court considered that the effect of the impugned transaction “was simply to remove that windfall”, giving effect to their original intention that Mr Brown was merely to have a nominal interest in the property (at [62]). More broadly, while the Court may not have used the word “fairness”, it was implicitly considering the question of fairness, at least to Mr Brown and/or his creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) It would not be fair to make the Payment Order against the respondents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Applied to the present case, I do not think that it would be fair for the Payment Order to be made against the respondents. I disagree with Affert’s characterisation that it waived or gave away a debt due from ICS and received “nothing in return”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, it is not correct to analyse the 7 October Letter in isolation. While the Letter seemingly contemplates Affert giving up the ICS Debt for nothing in return, the true nature of a transaction “must be viewed in the light of all the relevant circumstances” (see <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]). Indeed, “[t]o truncate the facts and view each event as distinct and separate would inevitably lead to a wholly erroneous conclusion, based as it does on a partial view of things” (see <span class="font-italic">Velstra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 With this in mind, the 7 October Letter must be viewed against the backdrop of the Acquisition. Contrary to Affert’s claim that it received “nothing in return” for the alleged waiver, it appears that IHBV only agreed to inject funds for the Acquisition if IHBV was satisfied that ICS’s related party outstandings would be settled. In my view, it makes commercial sense for IHBV to insist on the 7 October Letter, as part of the confirmation from all Archean Group entities that ICS’s dues to these entitles would be settled. Therefore, bearing in mind the commercial realities of the Acquisition, it would be unfair to the respondents if Affert can retract its confirmation in the 7 October Letter and obtain payments from the respondents for the very amounts that Affert had represented were no longer due. This would not further the policy object of s 98 of the BA and would, in fact, rewrite the bargain that IHBV had struck with Senfer for the Acquisition. Indeed, this would put Affert’s creditors in a better position than they would have been if Affert had not issued the 7 October Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In the final analysis, the reality is that the 7 October Letter cannot be divorced from the Acquisition. The Acquisition would not have made sense without the 7 October Letter. If Affert and its creditors wish to object to the 7 October Letter, they are effectively objecting to the Acquisition as a whole. Seen in that light, if Affert and its creditors wish to object to the 7 October Letter, then their real complaint lies with the controlling minds of the Archean Group who caused and/or procured Affert to facilitate the Acquisition by issuing the 7 October Letter. Any objection that Affert has against the 7 October Letter therefore lies with the Archean Group and not the respondents, as the counterparties to the Acquisition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 For all these reasons, I dismiss Affert’s application. In summary, I have found that the 7 October Letter is a transaction at an undervalue, but only because I am not able to estimate the valuable consideration that Affert received from the 7 October Letter. Indeed, had there been better evidence before me on this point, I might have well decided that the 7 October Letter is not a transaction at an undervalue. Despite this, I do not think that it is appropriate to make the Payment Order sought against the respondents. More broadly, this is because such an order would rewrite the commercial bargain that the parties had legitimately struck. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Unless the parties are able to agree, they are to submit their respective written submissions on the appropriate costs order for this application, limited to seven pages each, within 14 days of this decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I record my gratitude to both Mr Wong and Mr Bull, as well as their respective teams, for all their able assistance. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Soon Peng Adrian, Ang Leong Hao and Sia Bao Huei (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) (instructed), Darrell Low Kim Boon and Petrina Tan Heng Kiat (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Bull Cavinder SC, Kong Man Er and Tan Sih Si (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the respondents.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
