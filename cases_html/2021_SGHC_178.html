The Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski </span>(at [47]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… any new fact or change in the law arising after a submission to arbitration which is ancillary to the dispute submitted for arbitration and which is known to all parties to the arbitration is part of that dispute and need not be specifically pleaded. It may be raised in the arbitration, … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, a practical view has to be taken regarding the substance of the dispute being referred to arbitration:<span class="font-italic"> Prometheus Marine Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritim</span><span class="font-italic">a SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”) (at [52]), the court referred to <span class="font-italic">Kempinski </span>and concluded that “an issue which surfaces in the course of the arbitration and is known to all the parties would be considered to have been submitted to the arbitral tribunal even if it is not part of any memorandum of issues or pleadings”. However, this statement must be looked at in its proper context. As the court pointed out in <span class="font-italic">CAI v CAJ and another</span> [2021] SGHC 21 (“<span class="font-italic">CAI</span>”) (at [202]),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the judge in <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>was referring to the scenario painted in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the law had changed or a new fact arose after the arbitration reference had started and such change was not known to the parties. In addition, it must be noted that even in the scenario painted in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>, what may be raised in the arbitration, although not pleaded, are only matters that are <span class="font-italic">ancillary </span>to the dispute submitted for arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I agreed with the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">CAI </span>(at [203])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>, read in its proper context, does not … open the door for an arbitrant to raise a new claim, defence or issue at any stage of the arbitration and in any manner it pleases. … one has to always bear in mind that in an arbitration, the tribunal’s jurisdiction is demarcated by what the <span class="font-italic">parties agree</span> to submit to the tribunal for determination … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, an arbitral tribunal is not entitled to depart from the pleadings to the extent of making its decision based on a ground that has not been pleaded at all and which cannot be said to be ancillary to what has been pleaded. Or as the court put it in <span class="font-italic">CAI </span>(at [203]), “there must be some reference in the pleadings to the claim, defence or issue that the tribunal eventually decided upon”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Indeed, the decision in <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> demonstrates this. That case involved contracts for the sale of two vessels. Clause 11 of the contracts required the respondent/seller to ensure that repairs were completed before issuing the Notice of Readiness. The dispute that was submitted to arbitration concerned the validity of a Notice of Readiness issued by the respondent, which in turn depended on whether the respondent had complied with its obligation under cl 11. The arbitrator held that the repairs had been completed, and that in any event, cl 11 was not a condition precedent but a warranty, the breach of which did not entitle the claimant to terminate the contracts. The claimant sought to set aside the award. One of the grounds relied on was that the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction in deciding that cl 11 was a warranty. The claimant argued that the only issue which it had put before the arbitrator was whether cl 11 was a condition or innominate term. The court held (at [70]) that “the finding that cl 11 was a collateral warranty was not only reasonably connected to the arguments raised by both parties; it was a reasonable follow-through from his finding that cl 11 was not a condition”. In other words, the issue as to whether cl 11 was a warranty was ancillary to the dispute that had been submitted to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 <span class="font-italic">GD Midea Air Conditioning Equipment Co Ltd v Tornado Consumer Goods Ltd and another matter</span> [2018] 4 SLR 271 (“<span class="font-italic">GD Midea</span>”) provides a contrast. There, the dispute that was submitted to arbitration concerned the validity of a notice of termination of a distribution agreement issued by the respondent. The claimant’s case was that the notice of termination was invalid because, among other things, the respondent had breached certain payment terms that were agreed during a particular meeting. The arbitrator found largely in favour of the claimant but on the ground that the respondent had breached payment terms <span class="font-italic">under cl 4.2</span> of the agreement. The Notice of Arbitration, pleadings and submissions in the arbitration did not allege any breach of cl 4.2, and there was no reference to any breach of cl 4.2 in the parties’ “Agreed List of Issues”. The arbitrator’s interpretation of cl 4.2 was also inconsistent with the position taken by the parties on cl 4.2. The High Court set aside the arbitrator’s finding on cl 4.2 on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded its jurisdiction (at [62]). The claimant’s appeal against the High Court’s decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal with no written grounds of decision rendered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Finally, where a Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction by addressing matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, there is no further requirement to show that the applicant had suffered “real or actual prejudice”: <span class="font-italic">GD Midea </span>at [60].<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the law to the facts in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The defendant’s case throughout the arbitration proceedings was that it was entitled to the Success Fee on the basis of the Oral Agreement, or the Implied Contract, or the claim that the plaintiff was estopped from asserting that the Amended Agreement was no longer valid. This was plain from the pleadings and submissions made to the Tribunal. As the defendant itself said in its Closing Submissions before the Tribunal, the crux of its case remained that “there [was] a <span class="font-italic">subsisting agreement</span> after the expiry date on the [Deed of Novation] such that there [was] <span class="font-italic">no issue of expiration</span>” [emphasis added].

This was not surprising. After all, the defendant’s entire case was based on there being a subsisting agreement (on the same terms as the Amended Agreement) after 31 December 2013. This meant that neither Article 3.2 nor Article 12 presented any issues. the defendant’s Statement of Claim did not even refer to Article 3.2. It was never the defendant’s case in the arbitration proceedings that it had a valid claim if there was no subsisting agreement after the Amended Agreement expired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In fact, the Tribunal’s findings on Articles 3.2 and 12 were inconsistent with the positions taken by the defendant on those Articles. With respect to Article 3.2, the defendant had submitted that upon the expiration of the Amended Agreement, the plaintiff had an obligation under Article 3.2 to pay the Success Fee if an SPA has been executed <span class="font-italic">before</span> the Amended Agreement expired.

</div> In other words, the defendant accepted that Article 3.2 required an SPA to be signed before the Amended Agreement expired, and that the limitation period under Article 12 would have applied if there were no subsisting agreement after the Amended Agreement expired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In its Closing Submissions, the defendant also argued that Article 12 was unenforceable because it was unreasonable under the UCTA; however, as stated earlier, this was rejected by the Tribunal (see [29] and [35(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was clear that the Tribunal’s finding that the defendant was entitled to payment of the Success Fee was based on grounds that were entirely different from the defendant’s case in the arbitration proceedings. It was not possible to describe the Tribunal’s findings as being ancillary to the matter submitted to arbitration. The Tribunal’s interpretations of Articles 3.2 and 12 were also inconsistent with the defendant’s positions on these provisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In my view, this present case was similar to the situation in <span class="font-italic">GD Midea</span>. There, the arbitrator’s decision was based on a finding that cl 4.2 of the agreement in question had been breached but such breach was never part of the claimant’s case, and the arbitrator’s interpretation of cl 4.2 was also inconsistent with the claimant’s position (see [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 During the course of the arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal drew the parties’ attention to Article 3.2 and asked the parties to consider “the position of an opportunity notice that has been presented but not executed”.

</div> However, the defendant decided not to change how it framed its case. In its Closing Submissions and Reply Submissions, the defendant maintained its case as pleaded. The Tribunal should have respected the defendant’s decision as to how it chose to frame its case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As Dyson LJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Al-Medenni v Mars UK Limited </span>[2005] EWCA Civ 1041 at [21]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice that the parties should clearly identify the issues that arise in the litigation, so that each has the opportunity of responding to the points made by the other. <span class="font-italic">The function of the judge is to adjudicate on those issues alone. The parties may have their own reasons for limiting the issues or presenting them in a certain way. The judge can invite, and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the issues. Bu[t] if they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that decision.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above passage was cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Kempinsk</span><span class="font-italic">i</span> (at [36]), in which the Court of Appeal said that “the basic principles applicable to determine the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or the court to decide a dispute raised by the parties are generally the same”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the circumstances, I agreed with the plaintiff that in relying on its interpretation of Articles 3.2 and 12 to find that the defendant was still entitled to claim the Success Fee, the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction. This was sufficient for me to set aside the Award relating to the X Opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s other grounds </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff had also submitted that the Tribunal’s findings with respect to Articles 3.2 and 12 of the Amended Agreement were in breach of the rules of natural justice. In addition, the plaintiff submitted that the Tribunal breached the rules of natural justice and exceeded its jurisdiction with respect to its findings that (a) the acquisition of the shares in [X Co] in 2016 was the same transaction as the X Opportunity presented by [Z Co] to the plaintiff, and (b) the price paid by the plaintiff for the securities acquired pursuant to the VTO formed part of the “Consideration” for the purposes of computing the Success Fee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the light of the conclusions that I had reached regarding the Tribunal’s findings with respect to Articles 3.2 and 12, it was unnecessary for me to deal in detail with the remaining grounds that the plaintiff relied upon in these proceedings. Suffice it to say that, in my view, the remaining grounds were merely attempts to appeal against the Tribunal’s findings and were therefore not sufficient to set aside the Award relating to the X Opportunity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the above reasons, I set aside the Award relating to the X Opportunity under Article 24(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law on the ground that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction.
