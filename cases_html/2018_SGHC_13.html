However, on 20 March 2014, Cubix Group, C&amp;K and the AXXIS Companies filed notices of intention to act in person. I note that it is technically impossible for these defendants to act in person, since under O 12 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), a defendant to an action begun by writ which is a body corporate may only defend the action through a solicitor. Further, none of these defendants have applied for leave for their officers to act on their behalf. Since filing these notices of intention to act in person, Cubix Group, C&amp;K and the AXXIS Companies have not taken any further steps in these proceedings. They also did not appear at the hearing of the present application. This is an issue to which I shall return later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 15 May 2014, Cubix International, Ben and Bee (collectively, “the Represented Defendants”) filed an amended defence, which was subsequently amended again on 18 April 2016.

In the 24 December 2014 Letter, it was said that the documents in Categories 1(2), 1(3) and 1(5) were destroyed “in the first quarter of <span class="font-italic">this year</span> when the AXXIS Companies became dormant” [emphasis added].

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  6th Affidavit of Sim Bee Har, 17 May 2017, p 166.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This must refer to 2014, since that is both (a) the year during which the 24 December 2014 Letter was sent, and (b) the year when the Represented Defendants themselves say the AXXIS Companies became dormant. However, Ben’s Affidavit verifying the Third LOD suggests that the destruction of documents (or at least those in Category 1(2)) occurred in or around December <span class="font-italic">2012</span>, when the AXXIS Companies closed their office premises (see [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Secondly, the Represented Defendants have taken shifting positions regarding who was responsible for the destruction of the AXXIS documents. Ben’s Affidavit Verifying the Third LOD stated that the Category 1(2) documents “were disposed of<span class="font-italic"> </span>by the bookkeeper, one Ms Khoo” (see [27] above). Yet Ben’s seventeenth Affidavit suggests that Ms Khoo was already “serving her notice period” sometime shortly before <span class="font-italic">July 2012</span> (see [34] above), five months before December 2012, which is the earliest of the dates on which the Represented Defendants variously claim the Category 1(2) documents were destroyed. Finally, in Ben’s seventeenth Affidavit and Bee’s second Affidavit, Ben and Bee admit that they simply cannot recall who threw the AXXIS documents away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thirdly, the Represented Defendants have taken shifting positions regarding whether some of the documents even existed to begin with. With respect to Category 1(2), the Represented Defendants stated in a letter on 25 August 2016 that there were simply “no statements” for AXXIS Pte Ltd and AXXIS Group. However, in their Fourth LOD, the Represented Defendants <span class="font-italic">did </span>disclose bank statements for AXXIS Group for the period of May 2008 to December 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Fourthly, the Represented Defendants have taken inconsistent positions regarding whether they had any undisclosed AXXIS documents remaining in their possession, custody or control. For example, in the Affidavit Verifying the Third LOD dated 3 September 2015, Ben stated that the Represented Defendants had no more Category 1(5) documents in their possession, custody or control, and whatever Category 1(5) documents there were had already been disclosed (see [39] above). However, on 6 September 2015, after the plaintiff had filed the First Unless Order Application, the Represented Defendants suddenly gave disclosure of 134 items under Category 1(5). Then, at the hearing of the First Unless Order Application on 21 November 2016, counsel for the Represented Defendants stated that the Category 1(5) documents that had been disclosed so far were those obtained by “reasonable efforts”, and that he had “no instructions” about whether there were any others yet to be disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At the broadest level, the most significant shift in the Represented Defendants’ position is that they initially gave the impression that Ben and Bee <span class="font-italic">actually knew </span>what became of the AXXIS documents, but much later revealed that this was not the case at all. In the 24 December 2014 Letter, the Represented Defendants refused disclosure on the basis that the documents in categories 1(2), 1(3) and 1(5) had been thrown away. Then, in successive affidavits, Ben spoke in considerable detail about when, by whom, and for what reason<span class="font-italic"> </span>they were disposed of or destroyed. These statements were made in no uncertain terms. None contained the slightest indication that Ben was unsure of what had happened to the AXXIS documents, or that he was speaking based on his “limited memory”.

</div> In this regard, the plaintiff highlights that AR Lim must have granted the Unless Order on the basis that the Represented Defendants had further Category 1(5) documents in their possession. Otherwise she would not have remarked that the Category 1(5) documents for the period prior to 18 December 2009 were “missing”, and would not have ordered the Represented Defendants to produce Category 1(5) documents for that period. In view of this, the plaintiff says that the Represented Defendants were not entitled to simply repeat their position in Ben’s eleventh Affidavit that no further Category 1(5) documents were in their possession, custody and control because they had been “thrown away”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The plaintiff has relied on three separate arguments to found its attempt to strike out the defences of Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies: that a fair trial is no longer possible, that there has been a breach of the Unless Order, and that Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies are in contumelious breach of their discovery obligations. It should be noted, however, that these are not distinct arguments and there is considerable overlap between some of them. In particular, the considerations relevant to whether the defendants are in “contumelious” or “inexcusable” breach of their discovery obligations are equally relevant to whether their breach of the Unless Order (if any) warrants a striking out of the defence. Similarly whether Ben and Bee have breached the Unless Order is relevant to whether the defendants are in “contumelious” or “inexcusable” breach of their discovery obligations. I therefore propose to discuss these two arguments together, and will structure my decision according to the following issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies’ defences should be struck out on the basis that a fair trial is no longer possible.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies’ defences should be struck out on the basis that Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies have inexcusably breached their discovery obligations.

It is also clear, however, that the impossibility of a fair trial is neither a determinative factor nor a pre-requisite for striking out, and that a court may order a striking out even if a fair trial is still possible (<span class="font-italic">K Solutions Pte Ltd v National University of Singapore </span>[2009] SGHC 143 (“<span class="font-italic">K Solutions</span>”) at [126]). However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>(at [48]) stated that this would take place in “exceptional circumstances”, where the breach is “inexcusable” (at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In deciding whether there are such “exceptional circumstances” justifying a striking out, the court is entitled to look at all the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [48]). The cases have commonly used terms such as “contumelious” and “contumacious” to express the idea that something beyond ordinary procedural default is required (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Alliance Management</span>”) at [6] and <span class="font-italic">K Solutions </span>at [112], citing <span class="font-italic">Landauer Ltd v Comins &amp; Co </span>The Times (7 August 1991)). It is not the law, however, that <span class="font-italic">wilful </span>disobedience is required. Even a failure to comply with court orders “through negligence, incompetence, or sheer indolence” may justify striking out, as noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [40], endorsing the remarks of Auld LJ in <span class="font-italic">Hytec Information Systems Ltd v Coventry City Council </span>[1997] 1 WLR 1666 at 1677.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The courts draw a distinction between breaches of simple orders for discovery, and breaches of unless orders which specify the consequences of failure to comply (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span>, Vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) at para 24/16/3). The breach of an unless order is more likely to be regarded as “contumelious” conduct (<span class="font-italic">Von Roll Asia Pte Ltd v Goh Boon Gay and others </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1115 (“<span class="font-italic">Von Roll </span><span class="font-italic">Asia</span>”) at [49]).

Factors relevant to this inquiry include whether the defaulting party has shown that it has taken any reasonable positive efforts to locate or obtain the documents which it is required to disclose (<span class="font-italic">Von Roll </span><span class="font-italic">Asia </span>at [52]), and whether the defaulting party has shown an “unrepentant attitude” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chang-Rung </span>at [35]). Where an unless order requires a party to file a list of documents and an accompanying affirmation, that party’s claim or action may be struck out if the list is “wilfully defective” and displays no evidence of conscientious effort to give proper discovery (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span>, Vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) at para 24/16/1, citing <span class="font-italic">Ka Wah Bank Ltd v Low Chung-song </span>[1989] 1 HKLR 451, CA).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Whether the delay or default was due to any extraneous circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is also worth noting that a failure to disclose need not be continuing before it is capable of attracting a remedial response from the courts.

So, in <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal held that the Appellant’s action ought not to have been struck out despite the Respondent’s contention that the Appellant had provided inadequate disclosure, because the requested documents appeared not to exist, and in any event, an “adequate substitute had been disclosed in their stead” (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defences should be struck out on the basis that a fair trial is no longer possible</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As mentioned, the courts will strike out a defence or action where a failure to comply with the rules on discovery has created a real risk that a fair trial will not be possible (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [48]). The underlying reason for this is that in such circumstances “any judgment in favour of the offender [would be] unsafe” (<span class="font-italic">Logicrose Ltd v Southend United Football Club Ltd </span>The Times (5 March 1988) (“<span class="font-italic">Logicrose</span>”), as endorsed in <span class="font-italic">K Solutions </span>at [111]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-italic">Landauer Ltd v Comins &amp; Co </span>The Times (7 August 1991) (“<span class="font-italic">Landauer</span>”) provides an example of a situation where a claim was struck out on the ground that there was a real risk that a fair trial would be impossible as a result of a breach of discovery obligations. The plaintiff in that case was the parent company of three subsidiaries. The plaintiff and its subsidiaries engaged the defendants to act as its auditors. The plaintiff alleged that it was its policy to protect itself and its subsidiaries against foreign currency fluctuations by buying or selling forward. Its claim was that the defendants had on two occasions failed to draw the plaintiff’s attention to the existence of substantial uncovered liabilities in US dollars, which in turn led to the plaintiff failing to take measures to avoid substantial losses. An essential element of the plaintiff’s case was that it was wholly unaware of its foreign currency exposure. The defendants argued that the plaintiff’s managing director, a Mr Axford, knew or should have known of the fact and extent of the plaintiff’s foreign currency exposure. Lloyd LJ, who delivered the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, noted that Mr Axford’s state of knowledge would be “of critical importance” to the plaintiff’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiff was ordered to furnish discovery of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “files containing documentation prepared by the management of the subsidiaries and of [the plaintiff] in connection with the accounts and trading figures insofar as the same relates to dollar transactions” for a specific period between 1981 and 1985. However, it transpired that Mr Axford had destroyed certain documents circulated in connection with management and board meetings of the plaintiff and the subsidiaries (“management files”). The judge below struck out the plaintiff’s claim on the basis that Mr Axford’s destruction of the management files had created a real risk that a fair trial was no longer possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The English Court of Appeal upheld the decision to strike out the plaintiff’s claim. Lloyd LJ noted that based on the available evidence, it was clear that Mr Axford’s management files would contain the types of documents which would be “directly relevant to the question of foreign currency exposure and the steps taken to cover that exposure”. These were also the types of documents “which could prove vital in cross-examination of the plaintiff’s witnesses on the all-important question of their knowledge”. Without those documents, there was a real risk that a fair trial was no longer possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 <span class="font-italic">Landauer </span>was a case concerning the <span class="font-italic">destruction</span> of relevant documents. As I alluded to at [80(a)] above, there are also cases in which the <span class="font-italic">withholding </span>of relevant documents has led to a similar conclusion that a fair trial may not be possible. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chang-Rung</span>, Tay Yong Kwang J noted that the plaintiffs’ “deliberate suppression of highly relevant documents”, their “selective disclosures” and “hide and seek strategy” disclosed a “serious risk” that a fair trial would not be possible because there was no indication that the plaintiffs would pursue their claim honestly and fairly (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chang-Rung </span>at [30]–[32]). In this regard there is some overlap between this ground for striking out a claim or defence under O 24 r 16 and the ground of “contumelious” conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In the present case, the plaintiff claims that there is a real risk that a fair trial is no longer possible based on the destruction and incomplete disclosure of documents in Categories 1(3) and 1(5). Having considered the arguments, I am not satisfied that there is a real risk that a fair trial is not possible. I say this because I do not think that the allegedly missing or destroyed Category 1(3) and 1(5) documents are so “vital” to the plaintiff’s case such that their non-disclosure has foreclosed the possibility of a fair trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It bears repeating that the crux of the plaintiff’s claim is that the defendants wrongfully diverted the funds, clientele, projects and manpower of C&amp;K to the AXXIS Companies. I can well see that the balance sheets of the AXXIS Companies (Category 1(3)) and documents showing the costs, expenses and revenue of the AXXIS Companies in relation to their projects (Category 1(5)) are relevant and may lead to a train of inquiry which would result in the discovery of other relevant evidence. No doubt that is why they were included in the SD Order. This does not mean, however, that these documents are so central to the issues that without them there cannot be a fair trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In <span class="font-italic">Landauer</span>, the specific issue of Mr Axford’s state of knowledge concerning the plaintiff’s foreign currency exposure was described as “all-important”, and the management files were said to be “directly relevant” to this very issue.  In my view the present case is quite different. The “all-important” issue in the plaintiff’s claim is more broadly whether or not funding, clientele, projects and manpower intended for C&amp;K were wrongfully diverted to the AXXIS Companies. It was not clear to me that the balance sheets (Category 1(3)) and the costs, expenses and revenue in relation to each project of the AXXIS Companies (Category 1(5)) were “directly relevant” to this issue, at least not in the sense that the management files were directly relevant to Mr Axford’s state of knowledge in <span class="font-italic">Landauer</span>. The assets and liabilities of the AXXIS Companies, and the costs and expenses incurred and revenue generated for each of their projects would not show directly whether any wrongful diversion had occurred. In concluding that a fair trial is still possible I have also considered that the plaintiff has already obtained a significant amount of evidence relating to its claim, including evidence showing what projects the AXXIS Companies were marketing or pitching as their own,

</div> I will first discuss whether Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies’ defences should be struck out on the basis of their alleged breaches of the Unless Order, before I discuss the wider issue of whether their defences should be struck out on the more general basis that they have committed inexcusable breaches of their discovery obligations. I use the term “inexcusable” rather than “contumelious” (which is the term the plaintiff has used) to reflect the idea that apart from wilful disobedience, negligence and inaction can also justify the sanction of striking out (see [77] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breaches of the Unless Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Whether the defences should be struck out on the basis that Ben and Bee breached the Unless Order may be analysed in terms of two questions: firstly, whether, and in what way, Ben and Bee have breached the Unless Order; and secondly, if they have breached the Unless Order, whether these breaches warrant a striking out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Have the Represented Defendants breached the Unless Order?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It will be recalled that the Unless Order related only to Categories 1(2) and 1(5), and not to Category 1(3). There are two main obligations under the Unless Order which are relevant for present purposes:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Ben and Bee were required to explain why the Category 1(2) documents had emerged “later”, and if they had only obtained the documents after making enquiries with HSBC bank, to explain why such enquiries were not made “earlier”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, Ben and Bee were to produce the Category 1(5) documents for the AXXIS Companies’ projects prior to 18 December 2009 within 14 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I first consider whether Ben and Bee breached the Unless Order with respect to Category 1(2). Although Ben and Bee were required to explain why these documents had only emerged “later”, and why they did not make requests “earlier”, the Unless Order does not specify what is meant by the terms “later” and “earlier”. Nevertheless, I note the following exchange between AR Lim and counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Eddy Hirono, at the hearing of the Unless Order Application:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">PC: For [Category 1(2)], all the statements are now in save for AXXIS Pte Ltd.

We believe that Plaintiff should be entitled to costs. <span class="font-italic">Prior to us taking out the application</span>, they didn’t disclose. There has been no explanation as to why the HSBC documents only emerged later. This is the second point. Thirdly, see paragraph 17 of my submissions. As recently as 25 August 2016, [Ben and Bee] had stated that AXXIS Pte Ltd and [AXXIS Group] were dormant companies with no substantive business. After we took out the application, the Defendants had written to ask for AXXIS Group’s statements. At least in relation to AXXIS Group it had to be a lie.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ct: So any remaining issue on Order 1b?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">PC: Order asked them to explain why HSBC banks only emerged later.

In my view, it did not. The statements in Ben’s eleventh Affidavit do not explain why the Represented Defendants had taken almost two years between the 18 November 2014 Letter and 19 September 2016 to write to HSBC to request the bank statements for the AXXIS Companies for the year of 2009. I note that initially, the Represented Defendants wrote to HSBC on 16 March 2015 only to request for AXXIS International’s bank statements for 2008. Ben later revealed in his sixth Affidavit that this was because the Represented Defendants took the view that 2008 was “the only timeframe relevant to the discovery of documents”.

</div>
</div>
</div> But even if I accept that the Represented Defendants may have legitimately taken the <span class="font-italic">initial </span>position that some of the bank statements requested were irrelevant or unnecessary when they first received the plaintiff’s request, they could no longer take that view as of 13 July 2015, when AR Mak issued the SD Order, which confirmed the relevance and necessity of the Category 1(2) documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Yet even after AR Mak issued the SD Order, in Ben’s Affidavit Verifying the Third LOD dated 3 September 2015, he simply reiterated the position that the Category 1(2) documents were no longer in the Represented Defendants’ possession, custody or control. This was despite the fact that at that point, the Represented Defendants had <span class="font-italic">already </span>requested for and obtained AXXIS International’s bank statements for April to December 2008 from HSBC in March 2015 (see [25] above), and could obviously have done the same to obtain further Category 1(2) documents. Ben’s eleventh Affidavit contains no explanation for why this was not done. It was thus no answer for Ben to say that the Represented Defendants had disclosed these documents as late as they had because they needed to make requests from HSBC bank. The point was that they did <span class="font-italic">not </span>make the necessary requests until September 2016, more than a year after AR Mak had issued the SD Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having regard to the above I was satisfied that Ben and Bee did breach the Unless Order by failing to explain their delay with respect to obtaining the Category 1(2) documents in Ben’s eleventh Affidavit. I further note that to date, no satisfactory explanation has been given in any of the subsequent affidavits filed on behalf of the Represented Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I turn now to discuss whether Ben and Bee also breached their obligation to disclose the Category 1(5) documents for the AXXIS Companies’ projects prior to 18 December 2009. Unlike the SD Order, the terms of the Unless Order did not contain a statement to the effect that Ben and Bee could “file an affidavit to state that [the Category 1(5) documents] are not within their possession, custody or control and the reasons why”. The Unless Order simply required Ben and Bee to produce the Category 1(5) documents dated prior to 18 December 2009. There was no alternative. AR Lim was evidently convinced that there must have been such documents with Ben and Bee. Strictly speaking, that must mean that Ben and Bee breached the Unless Order because they did not<span class="font-italic"> </span>disclose further Category 1(5) documents within 14 days. Instead, Ben’s eleventh Affidavit simply stated that there were no further documents in Category 1(5) in the Represented Defendants’ possession, custody and control. If that were true, and if the Represented Defendants had taken steps to satisfy themselves that it was, then they could not be faulted even if they had technically breached the Unless Order. But that was not the case, as I shall shortly explain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Do the breaches of the Unless Order warrant striking out of the defences of Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As mentioned, once an unless order is breached, it falls to the defaulting party to demonstrate that the breach was not intentional and contumelious if he is to avoid the specified consequences (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [35]). In the English decision of <span class="font-italic">In r</span><span class="font-italic">e Jokai Tea Holdings Ltd </span>[1992] 1 WLR 1196 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Jokai Tea Holdings</span>”) (cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [35]), Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC stated that the defaulting party must show that “there was no intention to ignore or flout the order and that the failure to obey was due to extraneous circumstances”. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 361 (“<span class="font-italic">Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff</span>”) at [14] observed that the defaulting party must “show that he had made positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous circumstances”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Even where a breach has been found to be intentional and contumelious, however, the court must decide what is the appropriate response, having regard to the “drastic” effects of striking out an action or defence (<span class="font-italic">Von Roll Asia </span>at [43]). As stated by Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">Teeni Enterprise Pte Ltd v Singco Pte Ltd </span>[2008] SGHC 115 at [64]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clearly, the court must balance the need to ensure compliance with court orders … and the need to ensure that a party would not be summarily deprived of its cause of action or have default judgment entered against it without any hearing of the merits especially when the non-compliance or breach, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, was not so serious or aggravating as to warrant such a severe consequence: see <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man </span>[2006] 2 SLR 117 at [4]. The discretionary power to enforce the unless order according to its strict terms must therefore be exercised judiciously and cautiously after weighing everything in the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I am satisfied that in this case, the breaches of the Unless Order were intentional and contumelious, and were not due to extraneous circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As for AR Lim’s orders relating to Category 1(2), it was clear from the exchange between AR Lim and Mr Hirono at the First Unless Order Application that Ben and Bee were required to provide an explanation for their delay in obtaining the bank statements from HSBC - long after the plaintiff had first requested discovery, long after AR Mak had issued the SD Order and <span class="font-italic">only </span>after the plaintiff had taken out the First Unless Order Application. If there was no explanation for such delay, the Represented Defendants ought to have been upfront about this and apologised for their inaction. On any view, it was unacceptable for Ben to simply rehash what the court obviously already knew – that Ben and Bee had had to make inquiries with HSBC in order to obtain the documents, and that the plaintiff’s request had only come in 18 November 2014. Yet that was precisely what Ben did in his eleventh Affidavit, and that he did so reflects the Represented Defendants’ cavalier attitude towards their discovery obligations and the orders of the court. I further note that Ben in his eleventh Affidavit had reprised the point that all AXXIS documents had been discarded in order to reduce storage costs when the AXXIS Companies became dormant in 2014.

</div> He has since revealed in his seventeenth Affidavit that he made this statement without actually being able to recall if the AXXIS documents were ever really thrown away or destroyed (see [33] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I am also satisfied that Ben and Bee have breached AR Lim’s orders with respect to Category 1(5) in an inexcusable manner. Obviously, if it was true that Ben and Bee had no further Category 1(5) documents in their possession, custody or control, then even if they had <span class="font-italic">technically</span> breached the Unless Order by not disclosing further documents, that would be due to “extraneous circumstances” and not something which Ben and Bee could be faulted for. I should stress that I make no finding as to whether it <span class="font-italic">is </span>true that there were no more Category 1(5) documents. The plaintiff says the Peachtree Directory discloses documents falling within this category but I am not prepared to draw that conclusion based only on the filenames.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 However, even if I give the Represented Defendants the benefit of the doubt, and assume they <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>had nothing further to disclose within Category 1(5), it would surely be incumbent upon Ben and Bee <span class="font-italic">to make the necessary checks and enquiries </span>to satisfy themselves that this was true. They would also have to take steps to satisfy the <span class="font-italic">court </span>that they had made such checks and enquiries. I stress the statement in <span class="font-italic">Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff </span>at [14] that the defaulting party must <span class="font-italic">show</span> that he made positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Instead, Ben and Bee’s purported attempt to comply with the Unless Order took the form of Ben’s eleventh Affidavit, in which he simply stated that there were no other documents because they had been “thrown away” to reduce storage costs and because they were unnecessary for accounting purposes when the AXXIS Companies became dormant (see [42] above). It is by now clear that the above statement was made without Ben actually remembering if the AXXIS documents were ever really thrown away or destroyed or simply lost. It is also clear that the statement was made without Ben and Bee having started up the Old Computer to see if it contained any potentially relevant documents (see [46] above). Ben’s eleventh Affidavit also does not speak of any other checks, searches or enquiries that were made to verify that there were no further Category 1(5) documents to be disclosed. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that Ben and Bee have breached the Unless Order with respect to Category 1(5) in an intentional and contumelious manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The next question to be considered is whether these intentional and contumelious breaches of the Unless Order justify striking out the defences of Ben, Bee and the AXXIS Companies. I am mindful that in <span class="font-italic">In re Jokai Tea Holdings</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Parker LJ noted that there were “degrees of appropriate consequences” which may be imposed. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [45(c)])<span class="font-italic"> </span>also noted that the court has in its arsenal other means of penalising contumelious or persistent breaches, including awarding costs on an indemnity basis, ordering the payment of the plaintiff’s claim or part thereof into court, striking out relevant portions of a defaulting party’s pleading rather than the whole, barring the defaulting party from adducing certain classes of evidence or calling related witnesses, and raising adverse inferences against the defaulting party at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Nevertheless, in my view, this is a case where Ben and Bee’s breaches of the Unless Order warrant the “draconian sanction” (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [46]) of striking out their defence. Ben and Bee have been given ample opportunity to comply with the SD Order which was first issued on 13 July 2015, and with the Unless Order. Instead of making reasonable or good faith efforts to comply with these orders, they have, at best, been slow to act and careless and at worst, deliberately delayed the proceedings. Where called upon to explain their delay, they have been evasive, and unapologetically so. They have repeatedly asserted on affidavit that the documents they have been ordered to disclose have been destroyed or disposed of, even though neither Ben nor Bee can actually recall if this was the case. They have not demonstrated any positive efforts to comply with the court’s orders, and have shown no indication that they take their obligations and the court’s orders seriously.  They have dragged the Discovery process in this action over a period of more than two years.  This has unnecessarily increased the cost of the litigation and they have throughout, displayed a cavalier attitude towards their discovery obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I note that the Represented Defendants have argued that the facts behind the delayed disclosure of the Category 1(2) documents are merely background facts and are not essential for a “fair trial” of the plaintiff’s claim.

</div> The point, perhaps, is that there has been no prejudice to the plaintiff’s ability to prove its claim as a result of Ben and Bee’s failure to comply with AR Lim’s order that they should explain their delay. I do not accept this argument because their obligation to provide an explanation derives from the Unless Order <span class="font-italic">itself</span>. Subject obviously to their right to appeal (and Ben and Bee have not appealed), Ben and Bee <span class="font-italic">must </span>provide the explanation, even if they think their explanation would merely constitute “background facts”, as they say. Not only have Ben and Bee effectively refused to explain themselves, they are also <span class="font-italic">still</span> trying to justify their default by saying that the reasons for their delay with regard to Category 1(2) are irrelevant to the issues at trial. This is symptomatic of their utter disregard for the court’s authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Given Ben and Bee’s intentional, contumelious and inexcusable breaches of the Unless Order, I see no reason not to enforce AR Lim’s Unless Order according to its exact terms and to impose the very consequence that it stipulates – the striking out of Ben and Bee’s defence. I have come to the conclusion that this is not a disproportionate response having regard to the breaches of the Unless Order <span class="font-italic">as well as </span>the other ways in which the Represented Defendants have contumeliously breached their discovery obligations, as I shall discuss below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Before I turn to that, however, I should address one point: the plaintiff’s application is to strike out not only Ben and Bee’s defences but also those of the AXXIS Companies. The AXXIS Companies are legal entities separate from Ben and Bee. They were not the subject of, and have not breached, the Unless Order. It follows that their defences cannot be struck out based on Ben and Bee’s breaches of the Unless Order. I shall later address whether their defences can be struck out based on the wider argument that they have breached their discovery obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inexcusable breaches of discovery obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As I have mentioned, the cases have frequently referred to the standard of “contumelious” and “contumacious” breaches of discovery obligations, but it has also been recognised that “negligence, incompetence, or sheer indolence” (<span class="font-italic">Mitora </span>at [40]) may also justify the sanction of striking out under O 24 r 16 (see [77] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Having regard to the Represented Defendants’ behaviour from the time the plaintiff requested specific discovery to the time of this application, I agree with the plaintiff that they have committed inexcusable breaches of their discovery obligations. I say this based on the following factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Represented Defendants breached the Unless Order contumeliously, as discussed at [92]–[110] above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Represented Defendants have taken shifting positions with regard to numerous issues, including when and by whom the documents were destroyed, whether the documents exist to begin with and whether they have further undisclosed AXXIS documents remaining in their possession, custody or control at various points in time. The biggest and most egregious shift in their position was that they initially created the impression that Ben and Bee knew what became of the AXXIS documents (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>that they had been destroyed), but later, after having sworn numerous affidavits, revealed that they had made all of their previous statements based on Ben’s limited memory and without making any attempt to verify their claims. This is discussed in detail at [59]–[64] above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Represented Defendants have shown a consistent pattern of “drip-feeding” documents in the discovery process. They have on numerous occasions repeated the refrain that they have disclosed everything in their possession, custody and control, only to later produce further documents under the various categories without any explanation as to why this was not done earlier. These further belated disclosures are often made only when the plaintiff has taken out applications with the court to compel the Represented Defendants to cooperate. Examples of this include the belated disclosures of the HSBC bank statements under Category 1(2) and 134 documents under Category 1(5) in the Fourth LOD, which was filed after the plaintiff took out the First Unless Order Application (see [29] and [40] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Represented Defendants have taken a completely unrepentant attitude and have never once apologised for their various breaches. In fact, they continue to offer spurious excuses and continue to dispute the relevance and necessity of information they have already been ordered to provide. For example, in their written submissions for this application, Ben and Bee make the following argument:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The argument that the balance sheet must have more pages simply because it has page numbers not starting at 1 is simply <span class="font-italic">non-sequitur</span>, since the essential part of the balance sheets, being assets and liabilities, are displayed in documents already disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It is remarkable to me that at this stage Ben and Bee are still taking the position that they are entitled to choose which page of a balance sheet to disclose based on their own assessment of what is “essential”, notwithstanding the fact that they have been ordered to disclose “<span class="font-italic">all</span> annual financial statements of the AXXIS Companies…including but not limited to the balance sheets of the AXXIS Companies” under the terms of the SD Order (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Taking these factors as a whole, I was satisfied that Ben and Bee have demonstrated utter disregard for the Rules of Court and the various court orders that have been issued against them (in the language of <span class="font-italic">Alliance Management </span>at [9]). They have shown no evidence of conscientious efforts to give proper discovery. Their conduct gives me no confidence that they would defend the plaintiff’s claim in an honest and fair manner. I therefore strike out their defences on this basis as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Again, that leaves me to discuss the point that the plaintiff seeks to strike out not only Ben and Bee’s defences but also those of the AXXIS Companies. O 24 r 16 empowers the court to strike out a claim or defence of “a party who is required by any Rule in [O 24], or by any order made thereunder, to make discovery of documents”, but fails to comply. The problem, however, is that the AXXIS Companies were not even the subject of AR Mak’s SD Order, which was only issued in respect of the Represented Defendants. It therefore cannot be said that <span class="font-italic">the AXXIS Companies</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are in contumelious breach of their discovery obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 At the hearing of this application, counsel for the plaintiff Mr Dominic Chan stressed that the AXXIS Companies are not entitled to act in person as they have purported to do, have not sought leave of court to be represented by their company officer(s), and have chosen not to appear at the hearing of this application. That may be so, but those facts do not offer me a legal basis for striking out their defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 To conclude, I decline to strike out the defences of the AXXIS Companies. For the aforesaid reasons, I strike out Ben and Bee’s defences on the basis that they have committed inexcusable breaches of their discovery obligations and of the Unless Order, and enter interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff, with damages to be assessed. The costs of this action up to this stage of the proceedings are to be taxed and paid by Ben and Bee to the plaintiff. Ben and Bee are also to pay the costs of this application, to be taxed, if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Wai Kit Darren Dominic and Ng Yi Ming Daniel (Characterist LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Ng Boon Gan (VanillaLaw LLC) for the third and fourth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
