<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against assistant registrar
                    (“AR”) Jeyendran Jeyapal’s dismissal of the
                    plaintiff’s application to strike out the defendant’s counterclaim
                    in Summons No 6399 of 2009 (“SUM 6399”) on
                    23 February 2010. This was the plaintiff’s second attempt to
                    strike out the defendant’s counterclaim after his earlier application in
                    Summons No 1822 of 2009 (“SUM 1822”) had been dismissed by the
                    same AR on 8 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing parties’ arguments on
                    7 April 2010, I upheld the AR’s decision and ordered costs of
                    the appeal to be in the cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Dissatisfied with my decision, the plaintiff
                    wrote in with a request for further arguments on 14 April 2010. I granted
                    the plaintiff’s request and heard the parties again on 27 April
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After due consideration, I find no reason to
                    vary the order that I had made on 7 April 2010. I now provide my
                    reasons for my decision after stating the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff is a permanent resident of
                    Singapore and the controlling shareholder of PT Bayan Resources Tbk (“PT
                    Bayan Resources”), a public-listed company incorporated in Indonesia. The
                    defendant is also a permanent resident of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The present action arises out of an allegedly
                    defamatory letter, which was written by the defendant and sent to a number of
                    parties in Indonesia (one of them being the Head of the Indonesian Capital
                    Market and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency) when PT Bayan Resources
                    was in the midst of an international initial public offering and was to be
                    listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. In that letter, the defendant alleged
                    that he had a share in PT Bayan Resources and sought to prevent the company from
                    being listed. As a result, the allegations contained in the letter were required
                    to be disclosed by the plaintiff to potential investors worldwide, including
                    Singapore and Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff then commenced the present
                    proceedings in Singapore on 3 October 2008 by filing a writ of
                    summons, claiming damages in defamation and malicious falsehood. This was
                    followed by the filing of the defendant’s defence and counterclaim on
                    9 January 2009. The facts that the defendant is relying upon in his Defence
                    and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3) are set out in detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the defendant, sometime in late
                    1995, the plaintiff had approached him with a business proposition involving the
                    establishment of a coal mining business in Indonesia which entailed the
                    acquisition of coal mining concessions and the generation of revenue from coal
                    mining. It is the defendant’s case that the plaintiff orally represented
                    to him that this coal mining business, if established, would be worth
                    US$500m in seven to eight years’ time if listed on the Indonesian Stock
                    Exchange. The defendant also claims that the plaintiff told him that in exchange
                    for a sum of S$3m that would be used to facilitate the establishment of this
                    business, the defendant would obtain a 50% share of the entire shareholding in
                    the coal mining business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff and the defendant then allegedly
                    entered into an oral agreement or “common understanding” that in
                    the event that the coal mining business became established, the S$3m provided by
                    the defendant would be translated into a 50% share in the entire shareholding in
                    this coal mining business; otherwise, the plaintiff would return the sum of S$3m
                    to the defendant (“the Coal Mining Arrangement”). The defendant
                    further claims that the plaintiff subsequently issued a post-dated cheque dated
                    25 April 1996 for the sum of S$3m as “comfort” for the
                    money provided by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Based on this version of events, the defendant
                    pleaded the defence of justification and further claims against the plaintiff in
                    contract and, in the alternative, on the basis of proprietary estoppel or
                    constructive trust for, <em>inter alia</em>, 50% of
                    the shareholding of PT Bayan Resources or for the return of the sum of
                    S$3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first application to strike out in SUM 1822</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In SUM 1822, the plaintiff applied to strike
                    out the defendant’s counterclaim on the grounds that the defendant’s
                    allegations were false and without documentary evidence, and that his
                    counterclaim was time-barred or barred as a result of delay, laches or
                    acquiescence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After hearing arguments, the AR was of the
                    opinion that there were a number of disputes of fact and law that needed to be
                    scrutinised further, and he concluded that the defendant’s counterclaim
                    ought to be allowed to proceed to trial. The plaintiff did not file an appeal
                    because he felt that it was simply his word against the defendant’s and
                    conceded that the issues were better suited for resolution at
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second application to strike out in SUM 6399 before the
                AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The present application of SUM 6399 was the
                    plaintiff’s second bid to strike out the defendant’s counterclaim.
                    This time, the plaintiff sought to rely on two statements that were filed in
                    proceedings in Hong Kong in which both the plaintiff and the defendant were
                    involved. One of the statements was a signed witness statement filed by the
                    defendant on 13 June 2000 (“the 2000 Statement”) and the
                    other was a sworn affirmation filed by the defendant on
                    14 January 2008 (“the 2008 Affirmation”) (collectively,
                    “the defendant’s Hong Kong statements”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the hearing below before the AR, the
                    defendant objected to the plaintiff’s application on the ground that it
                    amounted to an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>. The defendant submitted that the
                    plaintiff, in his second attempt to strike out the defendant’s
                    counterclaim, was essentially re-litigating the same issues which had arisen in
                    SUM 1822, and the fact that the plaintiff has produced additional evidence in
                    the form of the defendant’s Hong Kong statements did not alter that
                    position because this evidence was available to the plaintiff when he first
                    applied to strike out under SUM 1822 and could have easily been produced at that
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In response to the defendant’s
                    objection, the AR pointed out that he was willing to accept, at face value, the
                    plaintiff’s explanation that he had earlier forgotten about the
                    defendant’s Hong Kong statements. The AR also found that the statements
                    “were of assistance and provided further insight into the case”.
                    Hence, he concluded that the plaintiff’s second application to strike out
                    in SUM 6399 “did not fall foul of the <em>res
                        judicata</em> rule”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff then referred the AR to a number
                    of paragraphs in the defendant’s Hong Kong statements in an attempt to
                    show that the defendant’s counterclaim was a sham and ought to be struck
                    out on that basis. In his Hong Kong statements, the defendant had alleged
                    that there was a “mutual understanding” whereby the
                    “advance” of S$3m (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above) would be set-off against certain moneys owed by him to the plaintiff. The
                    fact that the defendant had failed to mention anything about a coal mining
                    business at that time meant that the present counterclaim was really a sham, the
                    plaintiff submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In addition, the plaintiff referred to
                    paragraphs in the defendant’s Hong Kong statements in which the
                    defendant asserted that the plaintiff had never repaid any of the alleged
                    “advances”. The plaintiff’s case was that, as a result of
                    those assertions, any claims the defendant had against the plaintiff, whether
                    for the S$3m “advance” or the alleged investment in a coal mining
                    business would be time-barred by now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The AR, however, was not persuaded by the
                    plaintiff’s arguments in reliance on the defendant’s Hong Kong
                    statements. He was of the opinion that the paragraphs in question were
                    sufficiently ambiguous such that it did not warrant a striking out at this
                    stage, and that it was proper to give the defendant an opportunity at trial to
                    explain his version of events and his interpretation of the paragraphs in his
                    Hong Kong statements. With this, he dismissed the plaintiff’s second
                    application to strike out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s Hong Kong statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As the plaintiff’s application to strike
                    out was entirely dependent on the defendant’s Hong Kong statements, it is
                    necessary for me to first set out the background in which the statements were
                    made and the relevant paragraphs in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s 2000 Statement and the relevant background
                facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In 1996, the defendant approached the
                    plaintiff to buy the plaintiff’s shares in a listed company in Hong Kong
                    called China Development Corporation (“CDC”). A sale and purchase
                    agreement was subsequently entered into whereby the plaintiff and the other
                    shareholders of CDC (collectively, “the Vendors”) agreed to sell
                    their shares to a private company, Dynasty Line Limited
                    (“Dynasty”), which was controlled by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After Dynasty failed to pay for the CDC
                    shares, the Vendors commenced a suit (Action No 9505 of 1999) against Dynasty in
                    the High Court of Hong Kong sometime in 1999 (“the Hong Kong
                    proceedings”). The defendant, as director of Dynasty, filed the 2000
                    Statement and claimed, as his defence, that he had earlier entered into a mutual
                    understanding with the plaintiff to set off the purchase price of the CDC shares
                    against moneys owed by the plaintiff to him. According to the defendant,
                    the plaintiff owed him a total of approximately US$8.5m (which included the S$3m
                    referred to in his present counterclaim). However, the Hong Kong court
                    eventually found against the defendant’s company, Dynasty, and entered
                    judgment in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the purposes of the present application,
                    the plaintiff referred to paras 4 and 13 of the defendant’s 2000
                    Statement (“Para 4/2000” and “Para 13/2000”),
                    which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    [The plaintiff] was first introduced to me about 15
                            years ago. It appeared that we had much in common and quickly developed
                            an open and enjoyable relationship which lasted until late 1997/early
                            1998 when the matters forming the subject matter of this dispute first
                            came into issue between the parties. During the time of our friendship,
                            the [plaintiff] and I shared common business and personal interests, and
                            from time to time, even conducted business together. In addition, the
                            [plaintiff], as a friend, joined me on gambling trips.
                            Unfortunately, the [plaintiff] was not much of a gambler and regularly
                            made losses, and I made several advances to him of gambling chips and
                            cash to help him out on the understanding that he would repay them to me
                            at a later date. In addition, from time to time, the [plaintiff] would
                            ask me for help in relation to his business transactions. <em>For example, in late 1995, I advanced S$3,000,000 to the
                                [plaintiff] which was secured by a post dated cheque issued by the
                                [plaintiff] in my favour. (A copy of that cheque is attached as
                                Annexure ‘A’.) I was never able to present that cheque
                                for payment because the [plaintiff] informed me that there were

                            carried out my previous relationship with him in a dishonest or less
                            than frank manner. Indeed, the [plaintiff] at one stage owed me
                            personally some US$8.5 million which debt in fact led to the
                            discussions, dealt with in more detail below, resulting in [Dynasty]
                            purchasing shares from the [plaintiff] (and others) which led to the
                            events underlying this proceeding. I would like to elaborate on the
                            monies owed to me by [the plaintiff]. As admitted by him during the
                            trial against Dynasty in Hong Kong in 2001, [the plaintiff] accompanied
                            me on several gambling trips. On those trips, [the plaintiff]
                            regularly made losses and I would advance to him gambling chips and cash
                            to help him out, on the understanding he would repay me at a later date.
                            In addition, the [plaintiff] would from time to time ask me to help him
                            out in relation to his business transactions. <em>For
                                example, in late 1995, I advanced S$3,000,000 (around HK$16,000,000
                                at that time) to the [plaintiff], which advance he
                                ‘secured’ by issuing a post-dated cheque in my favour. I
                                was never able to present that cheque for payment as the [plaintiff]
                                informed me that there were insufficient funds in his account to
                                honour it</em>. In total, I made advances to the [plaintiff]
                            of some US$8.5 million. <em>Despite numerous assurances
                                from the [plaintiff] that he had the intention and ability to repay

                                into in 1996. At this time there was very bullish sentiment in South
                                East Asia and to have a controlling interest of a listed company was
                                considered a very valuable asset. It may be considered naïve to now
                                look at the matter with the benefit of hindsight to suggest the
                                price was too high but I suspect that, around the same time, a great
                                many business ventures were entered into at valuations which, 18
                                months or so after the Asian Financial Crisis, would seem somewhat
                                foolish. At this state, I also wish to emphasise that the reason the
                                consideration due under the SPA was not paid in full was a result of
                                the difficulties caused by the Asian Financial Crisis and not
                                through any pre-meditated plan to obtain the shares for nothing. I
                                do not believe the Asian Financial Crisis is mentioned once in the
                                evidence filed by the [plaintiff] and Provisional Liquidators, a
                                fact I find astonishing given the timing and nature of the
                                background events. Although I do not believe it is stated this
                                boldly, the inference is that there was never any intention to make
                                payment for CDC shares. That is a nonsense and I deny it
                                categorically. Had the economy and business proceeded as I (and a
                                vast number of others in this region) had hoped and envisaged,
                                payment would have been made. <em>I would also

                                    would be by way of set-off in relation to the monies owed to me

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues raised before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On appeal, the defendant again objected to the
                    plaintiff’s application on the ground that it was barred under the
                    extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>. Counsel for the
                    defendant, Mr Chandra Mohan (“Mr Mohan”), also pointed
                    out that, curiously, the plaintiff had only applied to strike out the
                    defendant’s counterclaim but not his defence. Mr Mohan submitted that
                    because both the defence and counterclaim refer to the same set of facts, to
                    allow the striking out of the defendant’s counterclaim while leaving his
                    defence intact would amount to a meaningless exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Relying again on the defendant’s Hong
                    Kong statements, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Tony Yeo
                    (“Mr Yeo”), raised the exact same two arguments before me as
                    was raised before the AR below: first, that the defendant’s counterclaim
                    was a sham; and second, that the defendant’s counterclaim was
                    time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I first address the defendant’s
                    objection on the ground of <em>res judicata</em> before I
                    proceed to deal with the plaintiff’s striking out claim
                proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Whether the plaintiff’s application is barred by the
                extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> (also known as the rule in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> (1843) 3 Hare 100) is founded on
                    the wider doctrine of abuse of process and, generally, precludes parties from
                    raising subject matter that could have been raised in earlier proceedings. Sir
                    Thomas Bingham MR, sitting in the English Court of Appeal, stated the rule as
                    follows (<em>Barrow v Bankside Agency Ltd</em>
                    [1996] 1 WLR 257 at 260):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule in <em>Henderson v. Henderson</em> (1843)
                        3 Hare 100 is very well known. It requires the parties, when a
                        matter becomes the subject of litigation between them in a court of
                        competent jurisdiction, to bring their whole case before the court so that
                        all aspects of it may be finally decided (subject, of course, to any appeal)
                        once and for all. In the absence of special circumstances, the parties
                        cannot return to the court to advance arguments, claims or defences which
                        they could have put forward for decision on the first occasion but failed to
                        raise. The rule is not based on the doctrine of <em>res
                            judicata</em> in a narrow sense, nor even on any strict doctrine
                        of issue or cause of action estoppel. It is a rule of public policy based on
                        the desirability, in the general interest as well as that of the parties
                        themselves, that litigation should not drag on for ever and that a defendant
                        should not be oppressed by successive suits when one would do. That is the
                        abuse at which the rule is directed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, the mere finding that a claim could
                    have been raised in earlier proceedings does not automatically render the
                    raising of the claim in later proceedings an abuse of process under the doctrine
                    of extended <em>res judicata</em>. The court needs to adopt
                    a broad merits-based approach in deciding whether there was any abuse of the
                    court’s process, as explained by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</em>
                    [2002] 2 AC 1 (at 31):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… But <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> abuse of
                        process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of
                        action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The
                        underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in
                        litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter.
                        This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and
                        economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and
                        the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence
                        in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is
                        satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or
                        defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be
                        raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be
                        found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a
                        previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present
                        the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will
                        rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the
                        court regards as unjust harassment of a party. <em>It is,
                            however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in
                            earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of
                            it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too
                            dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad,
                            merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private
                            interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case,
                            focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the
                            circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court
                            by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised
                            before</em>. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms
                        of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine
                        whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This broad, merits-based approach has been
                    adopted by the Singapore courts in <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian
                        Teck</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 in which Sundaresh
                    Menon JC also provided a suitable reminder of the policies at play behind
                    the rule (at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give
                        rise to an abuse of process, the court should not adopt an inflexible or
                        unyielding attitude but should remain guided by <em>the
                            balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that
                            a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court
                            and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation
                            would be unduly oppressive to the defendant</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the facts of the present case, I was of the
                    opinion that the plaintiff’s application to strike out in SUM 6399 was not
                    an abuse of the court’s process under the doctrine of extended <em>res judicata</em>. Although the defendant was correct to say
                    that his Hong Kong statements were available to the plaintiff and could have
                    been adduced when the first application to strike out in SUM 1822 was
                    filed, this in itself did not render the second application an abuse of process,
                    following the broad, merits-based approach. This is because the
                    defendant’s Hong Kong statements were highly relevant to the main action
                    and especially pertinent to the question of whether there was any oral agreement
                    or “mutual understanding” as alleged by the defendant. In my view,
                    the defendant’s Hong Kong statements, if unaddressed, had the potential to
                    raise serious doubts as to the plausibility of the defendant’s
                    counterclaim. Balancing the plaintiff’s right to press his case if he has
                    a genuine claim against the defendant’s right to be protected from
                    repeated and oppressive applications, I found that the plaintiff’s second
                    application in SUM 6399 was not abusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Before I turn to address the issues raised in
                    the plaintiff’s striking out application, I first set out the legal

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The court’s exercise of its jurisdiction
                    to strike out pleadings is essentially an exercise in striking the right balance
                    between a litigant’s right to institute a <em>bona
                        fide</em> claim before the courts and to prosecute it in the usual way

                    [1973] 1 WLR 1019 at 1027).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This balance has found expression in myriad
                    ways but they all emphasise the same point, which is that the courts are usually
                    reluctant to strike out claims summarily, and thus an applicant seeking to
                    strike out a claim has to cross a very high threshold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     A number of different expressions were
                    recently restated in the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Wing Joo
                        Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 (at [171]–[173]).
                    First, it has been said that the court can only exercise its power to strike out
                    pleadings if the case for striking out was “<em>plain and
                        obvious</em>” (<em>The
                        “Osprey”</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099
                    at [6]). Similarly, the courts will let a party proceed with an action
                    unless his case is “<em>wholly
                    unarguable</em>” (<em>Blue Town Investments Ltd v
                        Higgs and Hill plc</em> [1990] 1 WLR 696 at 701).
                    As a result, the court’s jurisdiction to strike out “ought to be
                    very sparingly exercised, and <em>only in very exceptional
                        cases</em>” (<em>Dow Hager Lawrance v Lord
                        Dorreys</em> (1890) 15 App Cas 210 at 219).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Some other similar expressions are also found
                    in the High Court decision of <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for
                        Home Affairs</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 whereby
                    V K Rajah J made clear what in his view was the standard that had
                    to be met before a striking out application would be allowed (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To succeed in striking out the instant proceedings, the AG has to show
                        that the claim is frivolous or vexatious because it is <em>obviously unsustainable</em>and/or an abuse of the process of
                        court with <em>absolutely no prospect of success</em>
                        in the event of a full hearing. <em>It must be shown with
                            clarity and certainty</em> that the police had the power to
                        intervene in the protest and duly seize the T-shirts. There should be no
                        basis or latitude for arguing that such a power was arbitrarily exercised
                        and in any manner susceptible to judicial scrutiny. A court should only
                        strike out a claim “<em>when it is manifest that there
                            is an answer immediately destructive of whatever claim to relief is
                            made</em>”: <em>Ronex Properties Ltd v John

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is with these principles in mind that I now
                    address the issues raised by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Whether the counterclaim was a sham</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the issue of whether the defendant’s
                    counterclaim was a sham that ought to be struck out, the plaintiff basically
                    repeated the argument that he had advanced before the AR below (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff’s argument on this point,
                    as I understood it, can simply be summarised as follows: the fact that the
                    defendant had asked for repayment of the S$3m and had attempted to set-off the
                    S$3m against the purchase price of the CDC shares (which was the
                    defendant’s case in his Hong Kong statements: see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> and <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above) without
                    any mention of the Coal Mining Arrangement <em>contradicted</em> his assertion that there was a Coal Mining
                    Arrangement between them whereby the S$3m was advanced by the defendant to the
                    plaintiff for the establishment of a coal mining business (which is the
                    defendant’s case in the present action: see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). This supposed contradiction, the plaintiff
                    submitted, showed that the defendant’s present counterclaim was a sham and
                    ought to be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     However, the defendant had a ready explanation
                    for omitting the Coal Mining Arrangement from his Hong Kong statements. The
                    defendant claimed that he had not been kept apprised by the plaintiff of
                    progress of the coal mining business and, additionally, had reason to believe
                    that it had not taken off because he was under the impression that the plaintiff
                    was facing financial difficulties for a number of years between 1995/1996 and
                    1999. It was only in or about June or July of 2008, the defendant explained,
                    that he found out through “market talk” and the Indonesian
                    Offering Memorandum for PT Bayan Resources that an initial public offering of
                    the coal mining business through PT Bayan Resources would be conducted. The
                    defendant explained that as he was under the mistaken impression that the coal
                    mining business had not taken off, he had fully expected to receive credit for
                    the S$3m and his Hong Kong statements merely reflected that
                expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As I considered the evidence, I was mindful
                    that it was not my role to scrutinise the evidence in minute detail to determine
                    whether the defendant had a cause of action as, in so doing, I would be usurping
                    the role of the trial judge and conducting a trial of the case in chambers
                        (<em>Wenlock v Moloney</em> [1965] 1 WLR 1238
                        <em>per</em> Danckwerts LJ at 1244; adopted in
                        <em>Low Fong Mei v Ko Teck Siang</em> [1989]
                    1 SLR(R) 514 at [31]). All that was required of me at this stage
                    was to determine whether the defendant in the present case has disclosed a cause
                    of action in his counterclaim or whether he can raise some question fit to be
                    decided at trial, regardless of the strength of his case (see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)
                        (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                    2007</em>”) at para 18/19/10, p 311).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Like the AR below, I could understand why the
                    plaintiff brought a second application to strike out on the basis of the
                    defendant’s Hong Kong statements. On a plain reading of the
                    defendant’s Hong Kong statements, it was certainly possible for one to
                        <em>argue</em> that the defendant’s counterclaim
                    was simply an afterthought; for that reason, I agreed that there was a need for
                    the defendant to clarify his Hong Kong statements in the light of his
                    counterclaim. However, I was of the view that the defendant’s Hong Kong
                    statements were not <em>ipso facto</em> fatal to his
                    counterclaim at the striking out stage because the defendant had provided a
                        <em>possible</em> explanation for reconciling his Hong
                    Kong statements with his counterclaim, and I was of the opinion that it raised a
                    question fit for trial at which the defendant’s Hong Kong statements would
                    be scrutinised and tested. For me to delve any further into the questions raised
                    regarding the meaning of the defendant’s Hong Kong statements would
                    involve “lengthy and serious argument” by both parties and would
                    be tantamount to adjudicating upon those arguments on the merits based on
                    affidavit evidence alone (<em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee
                        Chong Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at
                [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The two cases cited by Mr Yeo on this
                    point did not assist the plaintiff’s case in any way. In the English Court
                    of Appeal case of <em>Critchell v London and South Western
                        Railway Company</em> (“<em>Critchell</em>”) [1907] 1 KB 860, the defendants
                    there had delivered, along with their defence to an action in negligence, a
                    letter (which was not written “without prejudice”) to the
                    plaintiff in which they unreservedly admitted to liability and that their
                    traverse of negligence in their defence was a technical plea merely to secure
                    that the money they had paid into court would remain there until the trial.
                    Cozens-Hardy LJ described the letter as “an admission of the most
                    formal and complete kind” and, not surprisingly, held that the defence
                    was plainly a sham (at 863). The case of <em>Critchell</em> is distinguishable on the facts. In <em>Critchell</em>, the defence could not stand alongside the letter
                    because it was clear that they wholly contradicted each other <em>and there was really nothing more to explain</em>; whereas in the
                    present case, the defendant’s Hong Kong statements were not an
                    irreconcilable contradiction of his counterclaim but rather, in my opinion, were
                    amenable to explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Similarly, the plaintiff’s reliance on
                    the Malaysian decision of <em>Seng Huat Hang Sdn Bhd v Chee Seng
                        &amp; Co Sdn Bhd</em> [1987] 1 MLJ 413 was, in my opinion,
                    misplaced. In that case, the plaintiffs had applied, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, for a declaration that eight possession orders earlier made
                    by the Magistrate’s Court had been procured by fraudulent
                    misrepresentation on part of the defendant. The defendant applied to strike out
                    the plaintiff’s statement of claim. Edgar Joseph Jr J held that
                    since there was no duty on the defendant to put forward a plea of want of title
                    on behalf of his opponent in the earlier Magistrate’s proceedings there
                    was no question of wilful concealment amounting to deliberate fraud
                    (at 420F–G). The striking out application by the defendant was
                    therefore allowed on the basis that there was “not an iota of evidence of
                    fraud” as alleged by the plaintiffs in their statement of claim
                    (at 420I). It can be seen that the case was actually decided on the point
                    that the plaintiffs’ claim had no legal basis because there was no duty on
                    the defendant in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Accordingly, I dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    argument that the defendant’s counterclaim ought to be struck out on the
                    ground that it was a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Was the counterclaim time-barred</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The plaintiff submitted that, by virtue of
                    s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), the
                    defendant’s counterclaim was out of time, in accordance with the relevant
                    limitation period of six years. It is not disputed that a claim is liable to be
                    struck out on the ground that it is conclusively time-barred (<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>, at para 18/19/10,
                    p 311) (<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> <em>supra</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the defendant pleads a defence under the Limitation Act (Cap. 163,
                        1996 Ed.), he can seek the trial of a preliminary issue, or in a very clear
                        case, he can seek to strike out the claim upon the ground that it is
                        frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process of the court (see <em>per</em> Donaldson L.J. in <em>Ronex
                            Properties Ltd. v. John Laing Construction Ltd. &amp; Ors</em>.
                        [1983] Q.B. 398; [1982] All E.R. 961, CA). Thus, where the statement of
                        claim discloses that the cause of action arose outside the current period of
                        limitation and it is clear that the defendant intends to rely on the
                        Limitation Act (Cap. 163, 1996 Ed.) <em>and there is nothing
                            before the court to suggest that the plaintiff could escape from that
                            defence</em>, the claim will be struck out as being frivolous,
                        vexatious and an abuse of process of the court …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff’s argument on the
                    limitation issue was that, even if it were true that the defendant had provided
                    an advance of S$3m to the plaintiff, time for the defendant to bring his claim
                    for the S$3m had begun to run, at the latest, from the year 2000 on the
                    following two grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_1"></a>(1)     The defendant had claimed in his
                        2000 Statement that he had asked the plaintiff for repayment of the alleged
                        advances; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_2"></a>(2)     The defendant had claimed, also in his 2000 Statement, that there was an
                        agreement for the alleged advances to be set-off against the purchase price
                        of the CDC shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The defendant countered that his counterclaim
                    was founded on an oral agreement entered into sometime in late 1995 on the terms
                    as set out in the counterclaim (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above). Therefore, the defendant’s position was that the coal mining
                    business was only established on 7 October 2004, and any right of
                    action pursuant to that oral agreement would only have accrued on such
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First ground of argument: the defendant’s assertion that he had
                asked the plaintiff to repay would result in the defendant’s counterclaim
                being time-barred</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the first ground of argument, Mr Yeo
                    relied on the following portion of Para 4/2000 (set out in full at
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Despite assurances received from the [plaintiff] as to his
                        intention and ability to repay me, I have never received the money
                        back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was argued that because the defendant had asserted that he had
                    asked for repayment on or before 2000, then, by his own admission, he would be
                    time-barred from claiming the S$3m now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I found it difficult to understand how the
                    defendant’s claim that he had asked for repayment establishes that the
                    defendant’s counterclaim is now conclusively time-barred and ought to be
                    struck out on that basis. In Para 4/2000, the defendant also admitted that
                    the plaintiff gave assurances of his intention to <em>repay
                        him</em>. It is trite that an acknowledgment of a debt results in a
                    fresh accrual of action from the date of acknowledgment as provided in
                    s 26(2) of the Limitation Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other
                        liquidated pecuniary claim, ... and the person liable or accountable
                        therefor <em>acknowledges the claim</em> or makes any
                        payment in respect thereof, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and
                        not before the date of the acknowledgment or the last payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would seem, at the most, that the defendant’s assertion in
                    Para 4/2000 would have set time running afresh for a claim in debt for the sum
                    of S$3m. Moreover, the defendant was bringing his counterclaim pursuant to an
                    oral agreement on the terms set out at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above, as to which there was a dispute as to when the defendant’s cause of
                    action pursuant thereto had accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Therefore, there was no basis for me to strike
                    out the defendant’s counterclaim as being conclusively time-barred on the
                    facts available before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second ground of argument: the defendant’s assertion that there
                was a collateral set-off agreement and the plaintiff’s denial of any such
                agreement would result in the defendant’s counterclaim being
                time-barred</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Secondly, Mr Yeo relied on the
                    defendant’s allegation in Para 13/2000 (that there was a collateral
                    set-off agreement (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) and the
                    plaintiff’s own witness statement filed for the purpose of the Hong Kong
                    proceedings, in particular para 18, which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">18.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>I further deny having entered
                                into an oral collateral agreement with [the defendant] in relation
                                to his purchase of CDC shares from me and the other
                                Plaintiffs</em>. In particular, I deny any agreement with [the
                            defendant] under which the purchase consideration owed by Dynasty to
                            those Plaintiffs, save for the initial deposits, would be paid to me and
                            that the Second to Seventh Plaintiffs would then look to me for
                            satisfaction of Dynasty’s obligations to them under the
                            agreements.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Yeo’s second line of argument
                    was built on the following two premises: first, that the S$3m advance formed
                    part of the collateral set-off agreement; and second, that, as a matter of law,
                    a party’s unequivocal intention not to perform his contractual obligations
                    would set time running for the other party to bring a claim founded on
                    anticipatory breach of that agreement. It was argued that because the
                    plaintiff’s denial of the existence of the collateral set-off agreement in
                    the Hong Kong proceedings amounted to anticipatory breach and had set time
                    running, the defendant ought to have brought an action for the
                    S$3m advance, such action being founded upon the collateral set-off
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In an effort to establish the first premise,
                    Mr Yeo sought to use the defendant’s 2000 Statement to characterise
                    the advance of S$3m as consideration for the CDC shares or for the collateral
                    set-off agreement. I found that to be a confusing argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     From a reading of the defendant’s 2000
                    Statement, it appeared to me that the defendant was asserting two separate
                    matters: the first matter asserted was that the S$3m had been advanced sometime
                    in late 1995 and had not been repaid by the plaintiff; and the second matter
                    asserted was that there was a collateral set-off agreement whereby part of the
                    purchase price of the CDC shares would be set off against the outstanding
                    personal advances owed by the plaintiff to the defendant, which included the
                    S$3m in question. In other words, this collateral set-off agreement, as claimed
                    by the defendant, would have been a wholly distinct and separate agreement
                    premised upon an existing and outstanding S$3m advance from the defendant
                    to the plaintiff. I could not discern, from the defendant's Hong Kong
                    statements, how, as Mr Yeo claims, the S$3m advance became part of the
                    collateral set-off agreement. When pressed, Mr Yeo could only say that the
                    S$3m advance had somehow “morphed” into the collateral set-off
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As the plaintiff had failed to show me, on the
                    facts, that the S$3m advance had formed part of the collateral set-off
                    agreement, the plaintiff therefore failed in this second line of argument. This
                    is because, even if the plaintiff could show that he had denied the existence of
                    any collateral set-off agreement in his 2000 Statement, there was nothing
                    in there to suggest that the plaintiff had denied an outstanding advance of S$3m
                    owed to the defendant and, thereby, set time running for the defendant to bring
                    his present counterclaim. Counsel noted, however, that the plaintiff did deny
                    owing the defendant US$ 8.5m in his affidavit filed for the winding-up
                    proceedings in Hong Kong, but that denial was of no assistance to the
                    plaintiff’s present argument because it was made in the year 2008 and
                    therefore raised no question of time-bar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Although counsel managed to raise some
                    interesting points of law, I found it unnecessary to consider them in the light
                    of my conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to raise any question of
                    limitation on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s appeal and ordered costs in the cause. I will hear parties on
                    costs in respect of further arguments.</p>
