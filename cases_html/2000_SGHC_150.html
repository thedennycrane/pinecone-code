<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. This matter came before me as cross-appeals against a district judges

orders on ancillary matters following the dissolution of a marriage.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the event the merits of the appeals were not argued and determined because

the wife, who I shall refer to as the appellant, applied to amend her notice of appeal before

proceeding with her appeal. After hearing counsel, I dismissed her application. Her counsel gave

notice that he had instructions to appeal against the dismissal. The hearing of the appeals was

stayed pending the disposal of the appeal against my order.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Background</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">3. The husband, who I shall refer to as the respondent, is in the employ of Dell

Computer Asia Ltd. Under his contract of employment, he would receive options to purchase shares in

Dell Corporation. These stock options would vest in him after a period of time. After a stock option

is vested in him, he may acquire stocks in the company by exercising the option and paying for the

shares. If he does not wish to exercise the option he can allow it to lapse.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Counsel categorised the respondents share entitlement under the options

into three classes -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) options which have not vested,</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) options which have vested but are not exercised, and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) options which have vested and are exercised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5. By Order 5 of her orders, the district judge ruled that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Petitioner shall be entitled to 15% of the Respondents Dell stocks,

  namely: -</p>
<p align="justify">(i) 111,100 shares purchased from the open market valued at US $4,575,986-80;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) 10,821 shares bought under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan valued at

  US$445,695-00; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the gains from Dell stocks <b>vested and exercised</b> by the Respondent

  under the Non-Statutory Stock Option Agreement scheme amounting to US$2,573,328-00 less tax to be

  paid on such gains (proof on demand of payment from IRAS).</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(The reference to "stocks vested and exercised" in (iii) above was

clearly an error, and should be "stock options vested and exercised.")</p>
<p align="justify">6. No order was made on the stock options that have not vested and those which

were vested but are not exercised.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Chronology of events</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">7. This is the chronology of the material events </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">20 January - the district judge made her orders,</p>
<p align="justify">1 February - the appellant filed her Notice of Appeal,</p>
<p align="justify">7 April - the appellant appointed her current solicitors to act for her in the

  appeal,</p>
<p align="justify">12 April - the district judge issued her Grounds of Decision,</p>
<p align="justify">13 April - the appeal came on for hearing for the first time, and</p>
<p align="justify">9 May - the appellant applied to amend her Notice of Appeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Notice of Appeal</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">8. In her Notice of Appeal the appellant sought orders <i>inter alia</i> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">72. The Petitioner be entitled to a greater share than 15% of the Respondents

  Dell stocks itemised at Order 5 of the Order of Court dated 20 January 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">3. There be a division of Dell Stocks in the Non-Statutory Stock Option

  agreements which have yet to be vested in the Respondent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">9. The other heads of appeal in the Notice of Appeal were for an increase in

maintenance that the respondent is to pay, and for an order that he contributes to the mortgage

payments on a property in the Gold Coast, Australia.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The hearing on 13 April</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">10. Counsel for the appellant informed Justice Judith Prakash that the parties

had received the grounds of decision the previous day, and that the appellant intended to amend her

Notice of Appeal. The hearing was adjourned to give time to counsel to prepare and submit their

cases.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The application to amend the Notice of Appeal</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">11. The application was filed to amend prayer 3 to read</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">There be a <u>division of Dell stocks</u> in the Non-Statutory Stocks Option

  agreements <u>which have vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondent </u>and which have yet

  to be vested in the Respondent.</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12. Three matters caught my attention on reading the application </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) counsel took more than 3 weeks to file the application after informing

  Justice Prakash of the intention to amend,</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the appellant was claiming a division of shares the respondent did not

  possess, and</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the appellant was not claiming a division of the unexercised vested

  options or their value.</p>
<i>
</i></blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The nature of the application</p>
<p align="justify">13. Counsel for the appellant characterised the application as an amendment.

Insofar as it sought to add a head of appeal to the notice, it can be said that it was an

application to amend the notice.</p>
<p align="justify">14. However, it is more than an amendment. The appellant wanted to pursue in the

appeal her claim for a division of the shares that the respondent would acquire if he exercised the

vested options. As she had not appealed against that part of the district judges decision and the

time for appealing against it had expired, she was also seeking to appeal against that part of the

decision out of time.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The rules to be applied</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">15. What rules should apply to the application? I am of the view that the

appellant must satisfy not only the rules for amendments, she must also satisfy the rules for

extending time to file notices of appeal out of time.</p>
<p align="justify">16. The law governing applications to extend time for filing notices of appeal

was set out by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in <i>Hau Khee Wee &amp; Anor v Chua Kian Tong

&amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1986] SLR 484</nobr> @ 488 when he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The factors to be taken into account in deciding whether to grant an extension

  of time to file a notice of appeal are:</p>
<p align="justify">(1) the length of the delay;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the reasons for the delay;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing is extended; and</p>
<p align="justify">(4) the degree of prejudice to the would be respondent if the application is

  granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">17. These factors were referred to and approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>Pearson

v Chen Chien Wen Edwin </i><nobr>[1991] 1 SLR 212</nobr> where Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated "(i)n

particular, the chances of the appeal succeeding should be considered, as it would be a waste of

time for all concerned if time is extended when the appeal is utterly hopeless".</p>
<p align="justify">18. The application before the Court of Appeal was for an extension of time to

file an appeal against an order on the division of matrimonial assets following the dissolution of a

marriage. The appellant was aggrieved that she was not awarded $160,000 that she has received under

a deed of reconciliation, but did not file her appeal in time. The Court dismissed her application

for an extension of time to file it because she had repudiated the deed when the respondent applied

to court in earlier proceedings for it to be approved. The Court disapproved of her inconsistency

and added that when a party applies to the court for an extension of time, the application should be

on grounds sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Consideration of the factors</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">19. <u>The length of the delay</u></p>
<p align="justify">The judgment was delivered on 20 January. The appellant had 14 days to appeal, so

time ran out on 3 February. She did not apply to add the new head of appeal till 9 May, more than

three months later. By any standard, this was a long delay.</p>
<p align="justify">20. <u>The reasons for the delay</u></p>
<p align="justify">The only reasons disclosed in the appellants affidavit in support of her

application were</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) when the notice of appeal was filed on 1<sup>st </sup>February 2000, it</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">was based strictly on the orders made by the learned district judge ("LDJ").

    In lodging the appeal, my previous solicitors merely based the appeal on the orders made without

    having the benefit of the grounds or basis upon which the LDJ gave her orders.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iv) the actual grounds were only given one day before the first</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">hearing proper and it was only thereafter (i.e. way after the filing of the

    notice of appeal) that my present solicitors discovered the LDJ did not take into consideration

    at all the arguments made before her regarding the vested but unexercised stock options</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21. There was little merit in these reasons. It was very clear from the district

judges orders without reference to the grounds of decision that there was to be no division of

shares in respect of the unexercised vested options. When the current solicitors were appointed,

that should also be clear to them, and it must also be clear to them there was no appeal relating to

those options in the Notice of Appeal. It is noteworthy that neither set of solicitors deposed any

affidavit to explain the delay. Furthermore there was no explanation for the delay in filing the

application to amend till 9 May, more than three weeks after counsel informed Justice Prakash about

it.</p>
<p align="justify">22. <u>The chances of the appeal succeeding</u></p>
<p align="justify">The appellant is claiming a share of Dell stocks in the vested options which have

not been exercised. The basis of the claim appears to me to be flawed. Stock options are not shares.

They are rights to acquire shares. Only when an option holder exercises an option and complies with

the terms of the exercise will shares be issued to him. As long as an option remains unexercised,

the holder does not receive any shares.</p>
<p align="justify">23. In the Appellants Case filed it was contended in respect of the unvested

options that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">33. On a proper construction of the relevant provisions of the Stock Option

  agreements, the options were awarded to the husband at the date of each agreement albeit they were

  only to vest at a future (specified) date. The husband had therefore, from the date of each

  agreement, the right to have the options vested in him, which right can be deemed a chose in

  action and therefore would comprise assets of the husband.</p>
<p align="justify">34. According to <b>Halsburys Laws (4<sup>th</sup> Ed reissue) Vol 6

  paragraph 1</b>, the expression "<i>chose in action</i>" is "used to describe all

  personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking

  physical possession."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">24. It is arguable whether an unvested option is a chose in action inasmuch as

the respondent may not have the right to have it vested. However, assuming that an unvested option

is a chose in action, a vested option is also that - a chose in action, not shares. The appellants

chances of success are low even if the amendment were allowed.</p>
<p align="justify">25. <u>The degree of prejudice to the respondent</u></p>
<p align="justify">Neither the respondent nor his counsel has asserted that he would be prejudiced

if the application were granted.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">My decision</p>
</i>26. The appellants application to amend the Notice of Appeal was filed very late, without

acceptable reasons for the delay. This can weigh heavily against her. In <i>Stansfield Business

International Pte Ltd (t/a Stansfield School of Business) v</i> <i>Vithya Sri Sumathis </i><nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 239</nobr>, Justice Chao Hick Tin (as he then was) found the failure of a solicitor to instruct his

clerk to serve a notice of appeal immediately after it was filed, and the clerks delay in filing

it were not sufficient grounds to warrant the exercise of his discretion to extend time for the

service of the notice by seven days, although he was of the view that there were merits in the

appeal.

<p align="justify">27. The appellants delay is long, unmitigated, and repeated in that after

being slow to realise that the Notice of Appeal needed to be amended, she was slow in making the

application to amend. She also faces the difficulty of seeking a division of shares the respondent

did not possess.</p>
<p align="justify">28. Looking at all the circumstances, I found that the appellant has not

presented a sufficient case for me to exercise my discretion in her favour to allow her to amend the

Notice of Appeal.</p>
