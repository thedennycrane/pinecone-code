        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, an architect practising in
                    Singapore under the name and style of TAG Architects, following an introduction
                    by a mutual friend Mr Yap Han Hoe (“Yap”), agreed to provide
                    the defendant, a Malaysian client, with professional architectural services in
                    two sequentially separate projects, <em>viz</em>, first a
                    residential house in Perth, Australia (the “Joondalup Project”);
                    and subsequently a second condominium complex in Balikpapan, Indonesia (the
                    “Balikpapan Project”). Both projects did not proceed to
                    construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It is not disputed that there were oral and
                    written agreements between the plaintiff and the defendant relating to the
                    appointment of the plaintiff to provide professional architectural services for
                    both projects, and that the plaintiff did provide the defendant with various
                    designs for each project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The dispute is instead over the precise terms
                    of the agreement, relating to the agreed payment terms, whether the
                    plaintiff’s designs had been accepted by the defendant and if so, how the
                    Singapore Institute of Architect’s Conditions of Appointment and
                    Architect’s Services And Mode of Payment Terms (the “SIA
                    Terms”) would operate with respect to payments claimed by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       For clarity, I will set out the facts
                    surrounding the Joondalup and Balikpapan Projects separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Joondalup Project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff, anxious to receive professional
                    assignments for his Singapore practice, was introduced by Yap to the defendant,
                    a Malaysian businessman engaged in building projects in Southeast Asia and
                    Australia. Through correspondence with Yap via a letter dated 4 March 2003,
                    the plaintiff offered his professional services to the defendant for the
                    Joondalup Project, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am to come up with a proposal and if this is not accepted by him, a lump
                        sum fee will be paid for work done. My scope of services is to complete the
                        design work and liaise with his local architects to do submission to
                        building authorities in Perth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Normally, I need to see the site and discuss terms and conditions of my
                        professional service before embarking on design work. Since we know each
                        other for sometime and with your assurance that [the defendant] is your old
                        school friend and that he is a fair and reasonable man with good credit, I
                        will leave the matter of fees for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However when my initial design is accepted, a progress payment will be
                        billed and thereafter as the project progresses. The terms and conditions of
                        engagement will be based on the standard set be [<em>sic</em>] the Singapore Institute of Architects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please convey the matter mentioned in this letter to [the
                        defendant].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff met the defendant on 15 March
                    2003 and thereafter proceeded with the brief for a project budgeted at A$10
                    million on a land area of 1.75 acres to build a 5-6 bedroom house with a 40,000
                    sq ft built in floor area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There is, however, some dispute over whether the
                    lump sum fee should his design not be accepted was specified as
                        S$50,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It
                    suffices here to note that in the letter dated 4 March 2003, there was no
                    specification of the lump sum payable upon non-acceptance of the
                designs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 30 May 2003, the plaintiff issued the
                    first invoice under the Joondalup Project for S$30,000, labelling the payment as
                    “Progress Payment #1”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    subsequently paid the plaintiff S$20,000, in two separate payments of S$10,000
                        each.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> No
                    conditions were stated or attached to these payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 31 December 2003, the plaintiff issued a
                    receipt for the S$20,000 received under the first progress payment,
                    characterising the received monies as “Progress Payment #1 billed as
                    payment for work done”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also issued a further
                    invoice for the cumulative sum of S$60,000, reflecting the previous payment of
                    S$20,000, and stating the balance sum payable as S$40,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    subsequently paid, on 12 July 2004, a further sum of S$30,000 to the
                    plaintiff. Again, no conditions were stated or attached to these payments. In
                    all, therefore, the defendant made three payments (S$10,000, S$10,000 and
                    S$30,000), amounting to a total payment S$50,000 (for convenience, hereinafter
                    referred to as the “S$50,000 payment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 10 March 2004, the defendant’s
                    representative one Mr Loo Woei Harng (“Loo”) wrote to the
                    plaintiff in respect of the plaintiff’s “Design Scheme #5”,
                    stating that “the basic design and form are acceptable” and
                    requesting the elimination of high retaining walls and conformity to the ground
                        profile.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 20 June
                    2004, Yap informed the plaintiff through email that the defendant was likely to
                    let the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s appointed consultant engineer, one
                    Mr Harry Lewis (“Lewis”), see through the Joondalup Project.
                    Yap requested the plaintiff to have a “details discussion” with
                    Lewis to see how they could derive “precise plans and
                        costs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> On
                    1 July 2004, Yap further informed the plaintiff that the defendant was open
                    to both the plaintiff and Lewis providing “total and comprehensive
                    services” for the project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff undertook further work
                    including the preparation of cost budgets for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 16 October 2004, the plaintiff, at the
                    defendant’s invitation, attended the 10<sup>th</sup>
                    Anniversary celebration of the Joondalup Country Club (the “Joondalup
                    Meeting”). The defendant offered a lump sum fee of A$1 million to
                    the plaintiff to complete the Joondalup Project. The plaintiff documented the
                    Joondalup Meeting in a letter dated 22 October 2004, but later opted
                    against the proposed A$1 million fee. On 1 December 2004, the
                    plaintiff wrote to the defendant referring to the Joondalup Meeting, and gave a
                    breakdown of the revised budget for the Joondalup Project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The defendant did not
                    reply to this letter. On 27 January 2005, the plaintiff wrote to Yap,
                    proposing to fix the fees for the Joondalup Project at a lump sum fee of
                        S$150,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    The defendant did not respond to this letter. The plaintiff repeated this
                    request on 15 September 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In this letter, the figures were
                    tabulated to reflect that the S$50,000 paid by the defendant thus far was used
                    as part of a “previous payment” for “design
                        work”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    Again, the defendant did not respond to the letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 28 July 2006, the plaintiff, by an AR
                    Registered letter, informed the defendant <em>inter
                        alia</em> that “[i]t had [<em>sic</em>]
                    been over 18 months that my commission to design the above project had been
                    completed satisfactorily with Scheme #9 dated 19 November
                        2004”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    There was no response to the letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In all, between April 2003 and November 2004,
                    a total of nine schemes were provided by the plaintiff with regard to the
                    Joondalup Project. As the plaintiff stated in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief
                    (“AEIC”), he often had to make substantial changes between designs
                    to accommodate the feedback given and requests made by the
                        defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> By way of summary,
                    the schemes were produced on the following dates:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the course of developing these designs and
                    producing a cost budget, the plaintiff made several visits to Perth, the costs
                    of which were reimbursed by the defendant. The plaintiff undertook work up to
                    readiness for planning submission and also undertook pre-tender qualification
                    work. When the defendant proposed to extend the scope of the plaintiff’s
                    brief to now include the completion of the project, the plaintiff considered
                    relocating his family to Perth but later demurred. The plaintiff produced
                    various lump sum fee proposals for this enlarged assignment, to which there was
                    no response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Balikpapan Project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By letter dated 1 June 2003, by the
                    plaintiff to Yap, the plaintiff recounted their meeting with the defendant on
                    30 May 2003 and set out his second terms of engagement as being:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... to design the condominium and liaise with [the defendant’s]
                        local architects to do submission to building authorities in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I also appreciate your comment that [the defendant] is looking for a good
                        design for the project which is to house his professional staff as well as
                        for sales to the public. And if I can deliver the design he wants,
                        professional fee is not a problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any case, the terms and conditions of engagement will be based on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff commenced work and produced
                    architectural design plans for the 5-storey condominium, incorporating further
                    changes requested by the defendant, right up to Scheme No. 4, and provided

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 11 September 2007, the plaintiff sent
                    two AR Registered letters to the defendant, addressing the Joondalup and
                    Balikpapan Projects respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> With regard to the Joondalup
                    Project, the plaintiff informed the defendant that the Project design was
                    “completed and ready for planning submission”, and that
                    “pre-tender qualification work [had been] done”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> With regard to the
                    Balikpapan Project, the plaintiff informed the defendant that the Project
                    “had been given both the planning and building plan approvals by the
                    Indonesian authority. The fee will be based on the tendered construction cost of

                    In both letters, the plaintiff also reminded the defendant that unless the
                    defendant was willing to meet within 21 days to agree on the final amount
                    of the plaintiff’s fees, the plaintiff would proceed to have his invoicing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant’s secretary contacted the
                    plaintiff on 17 September 2007, requesting the plaintiff to provide details
                    of his proposed fee based on a percentage basis. The plaintiff responded via two
                    letters dated 21 September 2007, each rendering details of the scope of
                    work and amount to be billed for the Joondalup and Balikpapan Projects
                        respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The fees were computed as percentage fees
                    pursuant to the SIA Terms, and were stated to be the sums of S$432,240
                    (Joondalup) and S$546,750 (Balikpapan).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 25 September 2007, Yap informed the
                    plaintiff via fax that “[the defendant] did express to you that he was
                    willing to pay you S$50,000 for his two projects in Australia and
                    Balikpapan”. On 28 September 2007, the defendant responded to the
                    plaintiff’s proposed fee structure alleging that both the Joondalup and
                    Balikpapan designs were not accepted and that the previous payments aggregating
                    S$50,000 were payments for the rejected designs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Following from the defendant’s refusal
                    to pay the sums of S$432,240 (Joondalup) and S$546,750 (Balikpapan), the
                    plaintiff instituted proceedings in this court to claim the abovementioned sums.
                    However, with regard to the Joondalup Project fees, the plaintiff amended his
                    Statement of Claim on 19 November 2009 to reflect a reduced claim of
                        S$415,472.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff made the S$16,768 deduction
                    because he erroneously assumed that the Joondalup Project’s professional
                    engineer fees, which were reduced by S$16,768, were not charged separately to
                    the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In any case, the plaintiff has opted to stand

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issues which arise for determination

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant accepted the plaintiff’s
                designs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The key issue on both parties’ pleaded
                    cases is whether the defendant had accepted the plaintiff’s
                        designs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> It is mutually agreed by both
                    parties in their pleadings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> that the implication of the
                    defendant’s acceptance of the plaintiff’s designs is, that had there
                    been an acceptance of the design, the defendant would be obliged to pay the
                    plaintiff professional fees for the work done as provided in the SIA
                        Terms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>
                    The determination of whether there was acceptance of the designs is a question
                    of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendant admits that he is experienced
                    and has retained architects to work for him. On these occasions he states that
                    he has signed formal contracts which would set out the scope of works as well as
                    the fees involved. He avers that he had paid the plaintiff S$50,000 and
                    reimbursed all his travel expenses and that he had not accepted the designs for
                    both projects. While it is standard industry practice for an architect to
                    request and receive an express written acceptance of design, the absence of a
                    letter of acceptance of design is not fatal provided evidence exists of the fact
                    of such acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I now proceed to consider the evidence
                    relating to the characterisation of the S$50,000 payment and the
                    defendant’s conduct during the correspondence with the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Characterisation of the S$50,000 payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s characterisation of the
                    defendant’s three payments amounting to S$50,000 is that these were made
                    pursuant to invoices issued under the Joondalup Project, as a form of
                    “progress payment”. The defendant characterised the S$50,000
                    payment as a rejection fee paid upon non-acceptance of the plaintiff’s
                    design. On the evidence before me, I accept the plaintiff’s
                    characterisation for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff continuously referred to the
                    S$50,000 payment as “progress payment” in all the
                        invoices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant’s characterisation that he was only obliged to pay a lump sum
                    fee if he did not accept the design does not square with his receipt of the
                    invoices and instalment payments thereon. As a businessman having experience
                    with building projects and architects, if such had been his understanding, the
                    usage of the expression “progress payment” should have evoked a
                    contemporaneous response or clarification from him at any time he made
                    instalment payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Next, although the parties agreed that a
                    “lump sum” would be paid upon non-acceptance of the design, in
                    none of the correspondence was the sum specified to be S$50,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> In fact, the
                    defendant’s first and only characterisation of the S$50,000 as a lump sum
                    rejection fee arose on 28 September 2007, more than three years after the
                    final instalment of the S$50,000 was paid on 12 July 2004. If the S$50,000
                    payment was indeed paid as a lump sum rejection fee, the defendant would surely
                    have explicitly stated so at an earlier date, especially keeping in view that
                    the defendant must have been aware that the plaintiff was conducting himself
                        (<em>eg</em> travelling to Perth) in a manner that
                    reflected the plaintiff’s belief that his design had been accepted.
                    Furthermore, the defendant was evasive when questioned about the S$50,000
                    payment. The defendant stated, in his Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief, that the
                    terms of the agreement were evidenced in the letters dated 4 March 2003 and
                    1 June 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> He could not explain why the letters
                    made no reference to a lump sum rejection fee of S$50,000, saying that
                    “it may be a mistake”. He also could not satisfactorily explain
                    why he did not make any changes to his AEIC to reflect the mistake. He first
                    contended that he did not know he was going to court, but when questioned on why
                    he did not make the necessary corrections <em>after</em> he
                    knew he was going to court, he suggested that it was due to his limited grasp of
                    the English language.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Finally, the defendant at no time provided any
                    explanation as to why the alleged lump sum rejection fee of S$50,000 was paid in
                    three separate instalments spread over a 12 month period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> If the S$50,000 payment was indeed paid as a
                    lump sum rejection fee, it is unlikely that the defendant would have paid out by
                    instalments without noting that such instalment payment signified non-acceptance
                    or pending a decision as to acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s conduct during the course of correspondence with
                the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Beyond characterisation of the S$50,000
                    payment, I find that the defendant’s conduct during the course of
                    correspondence with the plaintiff suggests that the defendant had in fact

                            of the design and is further substantiated by a perusal of the details

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As is evident from the transcripts of

                    to the question of whether or not he had accepted the plaintiff’s designs.
                    The defendant on some occasions stated that he had accepted the designs, on
                    other occasions said that he had “not yet” accepted the designs,
                    and on further occasions said that he had accepted the designs but did not
                    proceed with the project for reasons <em>other</em> than
                    the non-acceptance of the designs (for instance, that the “cost [was] too
                        high”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The defendant’s constant shifting
                    in position with regard to the crucial question of whether the designs were
                    accepted weighs strongly in my finding that the designs were
                accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant raised three arguments to
                    support his defence that he did not accept any of the designs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     He contended that the plaintiff’s
                    failure to point to a firm date of acceptance suggests that there was in fact no
                    acceptance of his designs. However, I do not find this a compelling factor.
                    Loo’s letter of 4 March 2004 would be sufficient evidence of an
                    expressed acceptance of the Joondalup Project design and the 12 February
                    2004 communication by Loo instructed the plaintiff to proceed with appointing a
                    local architect and to set up a company to make planning submissions to the
                    local authorities; this would be sufficient evidence of an express acceptance of
                    the Balikpapan Project design.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     With regard to the Joondalup Project, the
                    defendant pointed out that the plaintiff was “materially
                        inconsistent”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> in his evidence because the
                    plaintiff provided at least three different dates of acceptance, namely (1) an
                    “in principle” acceptance of Scheme No. 1; (2) an acceptance
                    of Scheme No. 3 “onwards”; and (3) “written
                    acceptance” of Scheme No. 5.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The defendant suggested that such inconsistency
                    evinced that there was no acceptance of the designs. In my view, the fact that
                    the plaintiff proffered three possible dates of acceptance <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Joondalup Project <em>does
                        not</em> unequivocally demonstrate that there was <em>never</em>, at some point in time, any acceptance of the
                    plaintiff’s designs, especially in view of the weight of evidence pointing
                    towards the defendant’s acceptance of the designs. Indeed it suffices for
                    the purposes of this action that I find that the defendant accepted the design
                    as of 4 March 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     With regard to the Balikpapan Project, the
                    defendant contended that the plaintiff’s failure to “issue any
                    interim invoice in relation to the Balikpapan Project” was indicative of
                    non-acceptance of the designs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Further, the defendant suggested that Scheme
                    No. 4, which the plaintiff allegedly submitted for approval from the
                    Indonesian authorities, was <em>not</em> accepted:
                    according to the defendant, as the plaintiff had already started working on
                    Scheme No. 5 when Scheme No. 4 was submitted for approval, this
                    indicated that Scheme No. 4 had not been accepted. I do not place much
                    weight on these arguments. Both the failure to issue an interim invoice
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Balikpapan Project as well as
                    the fact that the plaintiff worked on Scheme No. 5 whilst submitting Scheme
                    No. 4 for planning approval are equivocal: they provide little evidence
                    that the designs were not accepted. They are outweighed by the defendant’s
                    instructions thereafter to the plaintiff to submit the Balikpapan designs for
                    approval from the authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendant next argues that the plaintiff
                    shifts his case from that stated in the plaintiff’s pleadings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> According to the defendant, the
                    plaintiff’s contention that the terms of the agreement were contained in
                    two documents (<em>ie</em>, the letters dated 4 March
                    2003 and 1 June 2003) departs from his Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No. 1), in which the plaintiff stated that the terms of the agreement were
                    contained in a series of thirteen documents (Joondalup Project) and five
                    documents (Balikpapan Project).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The alleged inconsistency is,
                    however, more apparent than real: (1) it was the defendant’s own
                    contention, in his AEIC, that the terms of the agreement were contained in the
                    two abovementioned documents;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> and (2) no evidence was
                    adduced to demonstrate that the two documents were inconsistent with the
                    remaining documents. In other words, the plaintiff’s focus on the two
                    documents does not amount to any inconsistency with the plaintiff’s
                    pleaded case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Finally, the defendant argues that the
                    plaintiff’s making of substantial changes to the designs indicates that
                    the designs were not accepted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> However, while the making of further
                    substantial changes could indicate non-acceptance of the designs, this factor is
                    far outweighed by my finding that as from Joondalup Scheme No. 5 further
                    changes were no longer substantive to the design but were confined only to
                    refinements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the totality of the evidence adduced, I
                    find that the weight of evidence is in the plaintiff’s favour. First, on
                    the balance of probabilities, the S$50,000 payment was not a rejection fee. The
                    defendant appears to have subsequently and unilaterally considered this to be
                    reasonable payment in light of the fact that both projects were not proceeding
                    further to construction. Second, the defendant’s representatives’
                    express communications and his conduct indicate that the designs were accepted.
                    Crucially, the defendant failed to satisfactorily account for his failure to
                    communicate his non-acceptance, and did not attempt to otherwise explain his
                    expanding the Joondalup Project brief or for asking the plaintiff to submit the
                    Balikpapan Project design for planning approval. Third, the arguments relied
                    upon by the defendant to demonstrate that the designs were not accepted were
                    largely equivocal, and do not swing the balance of probabilities in his
                    favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The operation of the SIA Terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having found that the defendant accepted the
                    plaintiff’s designs, within the meaning of the engagement letters, the
                    operation of the SIA Terms is brought into play as they have been incorporated
                    into the terms of engagement by express reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The defendant first contends that the
                    plaintiff’s failure to institute arbitration proceedings indicates the
                    non-applicability of the SIA Terms. This I find to have little merit. Whether or
                    not the parties ought to have chosen to resolve their dispute in arbitration is
                    now moot in light of the step in the proceedings evinced by this trial: see
                        <em>Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers
                        Building and Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 168. In any event, it is not determinative of the contractual
                    question whether or not the SIA Terms apply to these contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I find that the SIA Terms do apply. It was the
                    defendant’s own contention, in his AEIC, that the terms of the agreement
                    were contained in the two letters dated 4 March 2003 and 1 June
                        2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>
                    As both documents explicitly incorporate the SIA Terms into the agreement, the
                    defendant cannot now be heard to say that the SIA Terms do not
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The defendant avers that if he accepted the
                    plaintiff’s design, the projects would move forward as governed by the SIA
                    Terms with specific terms to be agreed. It is open to the parties to agree on
                    the fee arrangements between them for each project. That these two projects were
                    not Singapore located projects they were at liberty to conclude any fee
                    arrangement as might be agreed between them. The plaintiff did propose an
                    alternative lump sum fee for the Joondalup Project on 27 January 2005 after
                    the Asian tsunami hit Phuket, where the plaintiff was based, and he urgently
                    needed funds. However the defendant did not respond to any of these proposals.
                    In the absence of any other agreement between the parties, the engagement
                    letters provided for the SIA Terms to operate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The SIA Terms Part 2 Architect’s Services and Mode of Payment sets out in Part 2.1 the Basic Services of the architect to consist of five stages: schematic design, design development, tender documentation, contract construction and final completion. Part 2.2 then sets out the mandatory mode of payment for basic services in stages. The SIA Terms’ sample Memorandum of Agreement between Client and Architect contemplates three alternative fee bases, <em>viz</em>, percentage, time charge or lump sum basis. SIA Terms (C) Recommended Scale of Professional Charges provides a default basis of fee calculation in the absence of other agreement between the architect and the client, and it reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “project cost” for each project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having found that the plaintiff was warranted
                    in adopting the percentage scale fee basis for his fees, the next issue is

                    for calculating his scale professional fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     With regard to the Joondalup project, the
                    plaintiff computed his fees based on the estimated construction cost of
