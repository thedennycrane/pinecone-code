<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff (“Lonpac”) and the
                    defendant (“AHA”) are insurance companies operating in Singapore.
                    Both of them issued workmen’s compensation policies covering, <em>inter alia</em>, the liability of Rotary Engineering Ltd
                    (“REL”) to compensate its employees who suffered work related
                    injuries. The main question is whether there is double insurance so both Lonpac
                    and AHA have to contribute to the compensation ordered to be paid to an injured
                    worker. The answer to this question may, however, be dependent on whether
                    extrinsic evidence can be admitted to help the court in the task of construing
                    the policy issued by Lonpac.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       REL is part of a corporate group known as the
                    Rotary Group of Companies (“the Group”). Lonpac has, for a number
                    of years, issued a workmen’s compensation policy to the Group. This policy
                    (“the annual policy”) is issued on an annual basis and covers the
                    calendar year. Among other things, it covers the liability of REL to its
                    employees for work-related injuries. The annual policy has been issued in 2006,
                    2007 and 2008 (to specify only the material years) and if Lonpac is liable under
                    the annual policy, its liability will arise in respect of the annual policy for
                    the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008. The wording of the
                    annual policy in each year has been more or less identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       AHA also issued a workmen’s compensation
                    policy but only in respect of REL’s liability specifically and not in
                    respect of that of other companies in the Group. This policy (“the
                    project policy”) was issued on 3 March 2006 and was to be effective
                    until 2 June 2008 plus a “maintenance period” of 12 months.
                    The policy covered REL’s workmen’s compensation liability arising in
                    connection with a specific project to construct petroleum storage and terminal
                    facilities on Jurong Island (“the project”) in which REL was the
                    main contractor employed by Universal Terminal (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“UT”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accident and the claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 29 November 2008, one Ganesan a/l
                    Subramaniam (“the claimant”), who was a crane and hoist operator
                    employed by REL, was injured in an accident while working on the project. On
                    23 December 2008, the claimant applied to the Commissioner of Labour for
                    compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act
                (Cap 354).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Based on an initial assessment by the National
                    University Hospital, the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) served a
                    notice of assessment on AHA requiring it to pay the sum of $54,900 to the
                    claimant. AHA objected to the notice of assessment on the basis that it was only
                    liable to pay 50% of the sum, and that Lonpac was liable to pay the other 50%
                    under the doctrine of double insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Having heard arguments from both parties, on
                    19 January 2011, the Assistant Commissioner of Labour (“the
                    Assistant Commissioner”) ordered Lonpac and AHA to each pay 50% of the
                    compensation sum assessed by MOM to the claimant in full and final settlement of
                    his claim. The Assistant Commissioner rejected Lonpac’s application to
                    adduce oral and other evidence to show that the claimant was not covered by the
                    annual policy. Lonpac was dissatisfied with this decision and therefore lodged
                    an appeal by way of the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">These proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By the originating summons herein, Lonpac has
                    applied for an order that the decision of the Assistant Commissioner made on
                    19 January 2011 (“the Decision”) ordering that Lonpac and AHA
                    each pay the claimant the sum of $27,450 as compensation in Workmen’s
                    Compensation Claim Case No 0825361E (LCH3) be set aside or revised. The
                    originating summons also states that the following substantial questions of law
                    have arisen in this matter <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Assistant Commissioner
                        had erred in disallowing the admission of extrinsic evidence;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the
                        Assistant Commissioner had erred in finding that Lonpac and AHA were each
                        liable to pay $27,450 to the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As an aside, I understand that this dispute has
                    not held up payment to the claimant and that he has in fact received the full
                    amount due to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was not disputed below and is not disputed
                    before this court that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The claimant was an employee of REL
                        working on the project when he was injured;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The claimant was injured in the course of his
                        employment with REL;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sum payable to the claimant was $54,900 as specified in the
                        notice of assessment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     AHA is liable under the project policy to pay compensation
                        to the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     An insurer has the right to claim contribution
                    from another insurer in a case of double insurance <em>i.e.</em> the risk insured and the person insuring are the same (Poh
                    Chu Chai, <em>Principles of Insurance Law</em> (LexisNexis,
                        6<sup>th</sup> ed., 2005 at p 1244). This appeal
                    therefore hangs on whether the annual policy also covers the risk triggering the
                    application of the project policy in this case <em>ie</em>
                    the risk of injury to the claimant, as REL’s employee, in the course of
                    the project (“the Risk”). Although the class of insured under the
                    annual policy is wider than the insured under the project policy – the
                    former being the Group as a whole whereas the latter is only REL – as far
                    as the Risk is concerned, the person insuring is the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As stated above, the primary issue is whether
                    the annual policy also covers the claimant’s claim, thereby triggering the
                    doctrine of double insurance and rendering Lonpac liable to pay half of the
                    compensation amount. This is a question of construction of the annual policy and
                    the main dispute is whether extrinsic evidence can be admitted to aid the court
                    in its task of construing the annual policy. The Assistant Commissioner treated
                    the issue of construction as being separate from the issue of the adduction of
                    oral evidence and both parties’ written submissions proceed on the same
                    basis. It appears to me, however, that the second issue (<em>ie</em>, whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to construe the
                    policies) is necessarily a subsidiary issue of the first (<em>ie</em>, the proper construction of the annual policy). If extrinsic
                    evidence is admissible to construe the annual policy, it must be taken into
                    account to reach a proper construction of the annual policy – it does not
                    seem sensible to reach a conclusion on the proper construction of the annual
                    policy before answering the question of whether extrinsic evidence is admissible
                    to construe the annual policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As a starting point, a plain reading of the
                    terms of the annual policy does suggest that it insures against the Risk. The
                    annual policy is drafted very widely, in particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                        “Business/Profession” covered includes “Engineering
                        Construction Works in the field of (1) Civil and Structural Works (2)
                        Buildings (including piling works) (3) Electrical, Engineering &amp;
                        Scaffolding Works (4) Mechanical Piping and Related Works (5) Engineering,
                        Construction, Installation, Consultants, Designers and Builders (6)
                        Integrated Maintenance and Repair Services”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The “Place/Places of
                        Employment” covered is defined as “At the above address
                            [<em>ie</em>, 61 Jurong Island Highway, Singapore
                        627860] and <em>anywhere in Singapore</em> as governed
                        by the Workmen’s Compensation Act” [emphasis added];
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     The categories
                        of employees for the purposes of calculating the Total Estimated Annual
                        Earnings are (i) “Managers/Management Staff”; (ii)
                        “Clerical Staff” and (iii) “<em>all
                            other employees</em>” [emphasis added]. It should be noted
                        that against each category of employee a figure was set out under the rubric
                        “Estimated Annual Wages, Salaries and other Earnings”. These
                        figures were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       On Managers/Management
                            Staff S$11,737,779</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       On Clerical StaffS$814,863</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       On All Other
                            EmployeesS$7,574,805</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A plain reading of the annual policy therefore
                    does suggest that it covers the risk of injury being sustained by all employees
                    of the various companies within the Group, in whatever capacity they may be
                    employed, including employment for a specific project such as that undertaken
                    for UT. There is nothing on the face of the annual policy to suggest that it
                    excludes the risk of injury to employees engaged in specific projects. Indeed,
                    Lonpac recognises this in its submissions where it argues that “the cover
                    provided by the two policies were not intended to overlap although a plain
                    reading of the said two policies without any explanation may suggest
                    so”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Nevertheless, this is not automatically fatal
                    to Lonpac’s position. Although there is a presumption that words in an
                    insurance policy, as with any other contract, should be construed in their
                    ordinary sense (<em>MacGillivray on Insurance Law</em>
                        (11<sup>th</sup> ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008)
                        (“<em>MacGillivray</em>”) at 11-006),
                    this presumption may be rebutted if it can be shown that the context in which
                    they appear indicates that the parties to the contract cannot have intended them
                    to be read in their usual sense (MacGillivray at 11-017).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Lonpac’s case is that the term
                    “all other employees” did not mean precisely that because the
                    figures under “Estimated Annual Wages, Salaries and Other
                    Earnings” did not reflect all the earnings of all employees who could
                    conceivably be covered by the term and that this was deliberately arranged by
                    REL which had or was taking out specific insurance to cover its project
                    employees. It argues the term “all other employees” should
                    therefore be read as only referring to those employees whose estimated earnings
                    comprised the $7,574,805 reflected in the column next to the term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Before the Assistant Commissioner, Lonpac
                    seems to have presented its case on the basis that the project policy covered
                    the Risk “more specifically” than the annual policy did. Differing
                    levels of specificity are, however, irrelevant to the question of whether there
                    is double insurance: it is perfectly possible for a more general policy and a
                    more specific policy to both cover the same risk if the risk falls within the
                    more specific policy, as it does here. What is crucial is not different levels
                    of specificity of the policies but whether the classes of employees covered
                    under the two policies are mutually exclusive. In this case, that means that the
                    annual policy and the project policy must cover different categories of
                    employees. Lonpac’s submissions on appeal come closer to this: it argues
                    that the annual policy covers the “general employees of the
                    company” whereas the project policy covers “employees involved in
                    the Project works”. Nothing in the annual policy, however, indicates this
                    scope apart from the quantum of estimated earnings. In order to show the full
                    context of the annual policy, therefore, Lonpac would have to rely on extrinsic
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lonpac seeks to adduce evidence to prove
                        <em>inter alia</em> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was the practice of the Group to
                        take up an Annual Work Injury Compensation Policy (of which the annual
                        policy here was one) for the “general business” of the whole
                        group; but as and when members of the Group secure specific projects, the
                        particular member company would take up a separate and more specific Work
                        Injury Compensation Policy in respect of that specific project (like the
                        project policy here);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The annual policy was therefore intended to indemnify against claims
                        from the general employees of the company whereas the project policy was
                        intended to indemnify against claims by the employees employed in the
                        Project Works;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The premium paid for the annual policy was calculated based on the actual
                        annual salary disbursed by the respective members of the Group to their
                        general employees for that particular year. It did not include the salaries
                        paid by any of the members for project employees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     The management of REL did not declare
                        the wages of those employees who were employed in the project when the Group
                        purchased annual workmen’s compensation policies for the years 2006,
                        2007 and 2008. This was because REL had obtained and paid for the project
                        policy and did not want to take out double insurance or pay double premiums.
                        The premium paid for the project policy was based on the estimated wages of
                        all employees working on the project for UT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Lonpac seeks to adduce this evidence in the
                    form of affidavits from employees of the Group and its insurance
                broker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Assistant Commissioner found that such
                    extrinsic evidence was inadmissible because the terms of the annual policy were
                    complete and unambiguous on their face, and “there was no need to risk
                    rendering unclear that which was unclear” (at [30] of the Decision). AHA
                    has made similar submissions in this appeal. Lonpac on the other hand argues
                    that the parol evidence rule is only relevant as between the contracting parties
                    - since the Group agrees with its position, AHA as a third party cannot rely
                    on the parol evidence rule to exclude evidence that would support an
                    interpretation of the annual policy as agreed upon by the contracting
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The admission of extrinsic evidence to vary,
                    contradict or add to the terms of a contract is governed by the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997) (“the Act”). The relevant
                    provisions are ss 93 and 94 which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Evidence of terms of contracts, grants and other
                            dispositions of property reduced to form of document</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">93.  When the terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other
                        disposition of property have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to
                        the form of a document, and in all cases in which any matter is required by
                        law to be reduced to the form of a document, no evidence shall be given in
                        proof of the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of property
                        or of such matter except the document itself, or secondary evidence of its
                        contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible under the
                        provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>...</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Exclusion of evidence of oral
                        agreement</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94.  When the terms of any such contract, grant or other
                        disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the
                        form of a document, have been proved according to section 93, no
                        evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the
                        parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the
                        purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms
                        subject to the following provisions: ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The question that arises in relation to these
                    sections is whether they mean that the parol evidence rule, as Lonpac argues,
                    applies only between contracting parties. In this regard, there is a difference
                    between s 93 and s 94. This difference was discussed by Andrew Phang
                    JC (as he then was) in <em>China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                        v Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 509
                        (“<em>China Insurance</em>”). Phang JC
                    recognised that while s 94 expressly applies only “as between the
                    parties to any such instrument”, <em>the parol evidence
                        rule as embodied in </em><em>s 93 of the Evidence
                        Act still applies where third parties are concerned</em> (<em>China Insurance</em> at [31], [32] and [34]). This same
                    reasoning was employed by the Assistant Commissioner at [23] of the Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The observation quoted above, however, does
                    not help us when establishing whether a third party can invoke the parol
                    evidence rule to exclude extrinsic evidence. On its terms, s 93 is about
                    proving the terms of a contract which has been put into documentary form.
                    Section 93 bars the proof of the terms of a document otherwise than by the
                    production of the document itself. It is s 94 that addresses the question
                    of how, having proven the terms of a written document, these terms are to be
                    construed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is no issue in this case of proving the
                    terms of the annual policy – there is no dispute that the terms of the
                    annual policy are as provided in the written document. The issue is about how to
                        <em>construe</em> these terms. Therefore, the
                    proposition that the parol evidence rule as embodied in s 93 applies does
                    not really assist in this case or in any case where the construction rather than
                    the proof of terms of a document is in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Lonpac relies on <em>China
                        Insurance</em> in support of its submission that extrinsic evidence
                    should be admitted. The facts of <em>China Insurance</em>
                    are similar to those of this case: the insured in <em>China
                        Insurance</em> took out two Workmen’s Compensation Policies.
                    There was strong extrinsic evidence that the insured had taken out the second
                    policy only because they were informed by their insurance broker that their
                    first policy <em>did not</em> cover liability to workmen
                    injured while onboard a vessel. Phang JC found that there was no double
                    insurance because the two policies covered different risks. In the course of his
                    judgment at [31], he observed that s 94 was irrelevant where third parties
                    were concerned:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although a plain construction of the documentary evidence alone adequately
                        supports the defendant’s case, the affidavit evidence referred to at
                            [20], [27] and [28] above conclusively determined, in my view, the case in
                        the defendant’s favour as it was relevant, admissible and persuasive.
                        Further, even assuming that a comparison of the policies alone was
                        insufficient to determine the case in the defendant’s favour, the
                        admission of the affidavit evidence would have clearly done so. This is why,
                        as already noted, counsel for the plaintiff was at pains to argue that such
                        evidence ought to be excluded as extrinsic evidence under the parol evidence
                        rule in general, and s 94 of the Evidence Act in particular. Section 94
                        of the Evidence Act, however, did not apply to the fact situation here. The
                        phrase “as between the parties” in s 94 clearly precluded
                        its application to the present fact situation. That this is so is
                        acknowledged in all the leading textbooks: see, for example, <em>Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</em>, (Wadhwa and Company,
                            15<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1999), vol 1 at pp 1273,
                        1309-1312 as well as 1319, and <em>Sir John Woodroffe &amp;
                            Syed Amir Ali’s Law of Evidence</em> (LexisNexis
                        Butterworths, 17<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2002), vol 3 at
                        pp 3230, 3247-3248, 3333-3334, 3339-3340 and 3381-3382. Indeed, a
                        literal, albeit reasonable, reading of s 94 itself will demonstrate
                        amply that the provision does not apply to fact situations such as the
                        present where both parties are essentially strangers to each other’s
                        contracts/policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     AHA attempts to limit the significance of
                        <em>China Insurance</em> on the basis that the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold
                        Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich</em>”)
                    recognised that the remarks of Phang JC with regards to the admissibility of
                    extrinsic evidence were merely obiter because he was able to find, on a plain
                    construction of the two policies, that they covered different risks. The
                    Assistant Commissioner made the same observation in the Decision at [24]. In my view, it is, however, wrong to
                    suggest that the Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich</em>
                    confined <em>China Insurance</em> to its facts. Although it
                    is true that the Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich</em> at [96]
                    recognised that the remarks of Phang JC on the admissibility of extrinsic
                    evidence were obiter, it went on in the same paragraph to state:
                        “<em>Be that as it may, they do shed further light on
                        the position in Singapore vis-à-vis the use of extrinsic evidence to
                        interpret a written contract</em> [emphasis added]”. The Court
                    of Appeal then went on to affirm (in Zurich at [97]) the significance of
                        <em>China Insurance</em> as “add[ing] to the
                    growing body of local case law adopting the contextual approach to contractual
                    interpretation while affirming, at the same time, the continued existence of the
                    parol evidence rule (as statutorily embedded in the Evidence Act)”.
                    Whilst <em>Zurich</em> deals, in some detail, with the
                    circumstances in which extrinsic evidence is admissible to explain a contractual
                    term, most of such discussion is not relevant to this case as it relates to the
                    situation in which s 94 is applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It can also be seen from the extract of the
                        <em>China Insurance</em> quoted above that the
                    restricted application of s 94 to the parties to the particular contract to
                    be construed is well established and accepted by leading textbook writers on the
                    law of evidence as it applies in India from whose Evidence Act our own Act is
                    derived. It therefore appears to me that there is no legal restriction on the
                    admission of oral evidence to explain or even vary or contradict the written
                    terms of a contract when the issue is between persons who are essentially
                    strangers to the contract. In this case, AHA is a stranger to the
                    contract/policy which Lonpac had with REL. There is nothing therefore to stop
                    Lonpac from introducing extrinsic evidence to explain what risks that policy was
                    intended, as between Lonpac and REL, to cover. In <em>China
                        Insurance</em>, Phang JC did not need to look at the extrinsic
                    evidence because the construction of the two policies showed that they covered
                    different risks. In this case, the two policies appear to cover the same risks.
                    If extrinsic evidence is not admitted, Lonpac will have to contribute to the
                    loss. Admitting the extrinsic evidence will give Lonpac a chance to show exactly
                    what its policy was intended to cover. If the extrinsic evidence admitted is
                    sufficient to show that the annul policy was not intended to cover employees
                    working on projects like that for UT, then Lonpac will escape such
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is not my role at this stage to decide what
                    effect the extrinsic evidence to be produced by Lonpac will have on the
                    construction of the policy. That will be a decision for the Assistant
                    Commissioner. All I decide was that it was not correct for the Assistant
                    Commissioner to have shut out the adduction of extrinsic evidence when
                    undertaking the task of construing the annual policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For the reasons given above, I set aside the
                    Decision and remit the matter back to the Commissioner of Labour for re-hearing
                    and consideration of any extrinsic evidence which Lonpac, and maybe AHA as well,
                    may wish to introduce. The costs of this OS must be borne by AHA. If parties are
                    agreeable, I am willing to see them and fix the costs after hearing short
                    submissions on quantum. Otherwise, Lonpac’s costs shall be taxed in the
                    normal fashion.</p>
