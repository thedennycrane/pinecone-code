        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In the present action, the plaintiff claimed
                    that the first and second defendants were jointly and severally liable for
                    $191,692.27 in respect of goods and services that the plaintiff had provided to
                    the first defendant under an agreement dated 15 April 2009 (“the
                    Service Agreement”). It is undisputed by all parties involved that the
                    sum of $191,692.27 was due and owing to the plaintiff (“the agreed
                    sum”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The dispositive issue was whether the first
                    defendant was liable for the agreed sum under the Service Agreement and, if not,
                    whether the second defendant was liable for the agreed sum under an alleged oral
                    collateral contract between the plaintiff and the second defendant. Also
                    connected to this was the second defendant’s counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff for a sum of $21,084.00 pursuant to two outstanding invoices for
                    services rendered by the former to the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is Sincastle Enterprises Pte Ltd
                    (“Sincastle”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant is Sulzer Chemtech Pty Ltd
                    (“Sulzer”), a company incorporated in Australia and formerly named
                    Towertech Pty Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant is Power-Vac Technology Pte
                    Ltd (“Power-Vac”), a company incorporated in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sulzer was engaged to carry out certain building
                    and construction work for an Exxon SPA-X project located at Jurong Island,
                    Singapore. Sulzer contracted with Sincastle to supply manpower and equipment in
                    this Jurong Island project, in a contract with Towertech Pty Ltd (currently
                    named Sulzer), which was signed by both parties on 15 April 2009 (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>. the Service
                    Agreement).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the Service Agreement, Sincastle set out its
                    unit rates for supply of manpower in specified categories and for diesel.
                    Manpower supply was also stated to be subject to availability and for the period
                    until the end of May 2009. The Service Agreement also provided that Sincastle
                    would charge for diesel supplied to Sulzer on the basis of the supplier’s
                    prevailing actual market price (plus GST), with a mark up of 10% (exclusive of
                    GST). Lastly, the terms of payment under the Service Agreement were as follows
                    (“the terms of payment clause”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>TERMS OF PAYMENT</b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As agreed, all supply of manpower, equipment, consumables or any request
                        of whatsoever, <b><u>shall billed to</u></b> the following
                        company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The terms of payment shall be 30 days from the date of our
                        invoice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before me, parties did not dispute that the
                    agreed sum was due and owing to Sincastle and that Sulzer’s had remitted
                    sums exceeding the agreed sum to Power-Vac. Sulzer and Power-Vac had a separate
                    bilateral agreement under which Power-Vac would consolidate all invoices payable
                    by Sulzer to several third party contractors in Singapore and that Sulzer would
                    then remit funds to Power-Vac following which Power-Vac would make payment on
                    these invoices. Power-Vac received a 12% service charge from Sulzer for these
                    services as an “administrative fee”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This agreement between Sulzer and
                    Power-Vac was not disclosed to Sincastle nor was it incorporated by reference
                    into the Service Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       However, Power-Vac did not remit the agreed sum
                    to Sincastle for the reasons stated below at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>. Both Sulzer and Power-Vac denied any liability to
                    Sincastle for the agreed sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was Sulzer’s position at trial that
                    having made payment to Power- Vac in excess of the agreed sum, it had no further
                    obligation to pay Sincastle. Sincastle’s position, on the other hand, was
                    that the terms of payment clause was no more than a payment mechanism under
                    which Power-Vac was a “centralised point of payment for administrative
                    purposes”. Accordingly, Sincastle argued that notwithstanding
                    Sulzer’s payments to Power-Vac, the former remained liable to it for the
                    agreed sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As for Power-Vac, it conceded that it had
                    received the relevant invoices for the agreed sum from Sincastle and that it had
                    received sums in excess of those due to Sincastle from Sulzer. It acknowledged
                    that it was holding and willing to account for up to $66,711.80 for the
                    Sincastle invoices. As for the remaining $124, 980.47 remitted by Sulzer, it was
                    not paid to Sincastle as Power-Vac had used this sum for payment of third
                    parties and in satisfaction of unrelated payments owed by Sulzer to
                    Power-Vac.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The factual context behind this Service
                    Agreement reveals that Sulzer was contracted to carry out building and
                    construction work for the Jurong Island project in Singapore. Sulzer outsourced
                    its manpower, equipment and consumable needs for the Jurong Island project to
                    third party contractors, including Sincastle. The evidence in court revealed
                    that the terms of payment clause had been required and the text was in fact
                    provided by Sulzer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The payment mechanism inserted in the Service
                    Agreement by Sulzer was as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Sincastle was to submit its invoices to Sulzer
                            for verification; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Only upon Sulzer’s verification was
                            Sincastle to bill Power-Vac.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The separate bilateral agreement, between
                    Sulzer and Power-Vac, provided as between them as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Power-Vac was required by Sulzer to consolidate
                            all the Sulzer verified invoices (including non-Sincastle invoices) and
                            send them to Sulzer in Australia; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Sulzer would then arrange for funds to be
                            remitted to Power Vac which would then pay on these verified and
                            outstanding (including Sincastle) invoices.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sulzer’s liability for the agreed sum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The question of Sulzer’s liability for
                    the agreed sum turns entirely on the construction of the Service Agreement
                    between Sincastle and Sulzer. At this point, it apposite to note that Power-Vac
                    was not a party to the Service Agreement. Furthermore, the agreement between
                    Sulzer and Power-Vac was not disclosed to Sincastle nor incorporated by
                    reference in the Service Agreement. Though Sincastle’s invoices for diesel
                    supplies were addressed to Power-Vac as required by the Service Agreement, they
                    expressly identified the Sulzer employee in charge, the Service Agreement
                    quotation number as well as enclosed copies of the diesel suppliers’
                    invoices which were addressed to Sincastle. As for manpower supplies,
                    Sincastle’s invoices were similarly worded and in fact enclosed copies of
                    time sheets verified and signed off by Sulzer’s project manager on the
                    Jurong Island site. Accordingly, the consistent reference to Sulzer’s
                    employees in the invoices which were addressed to Power-Vac as required by
                    Sulzer, re-iterated the bilateral nature of obligations between Sincastle and
                    Sulzer as contracting parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Further, the terms of payment clause expressly
                    provides that the bills are to be submitted to Power-Vac “to expedite the
                    payment to us” (<em>viz</em>. Sincastle). As a
                    matter of construction, it is one thing to expedite payment and another to
                    substitute the payment obligation to a non-party to the Service Agreement. It is
                    clear from the Service Agreement read in its entirety that the contracting
                    parties and obligations thereunder were directly and exclusively between
                    Sincastle and Sulzer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is also clear that Sulzer required a
                    billing process of consolidation and payment to be made through Power-Vac. This
                    payment agent and process was required by Sulzer which outsourced its required
                    manpower and supplies services. From the terms of payment clause, it is clear
                    that Sulzer was approving, verifying and making all the payments for
                    Sincastle’s invoices, using Power-Vac only as a convenient intermediary to
                    ensure timely payment to Sincastle. On this point, the following passage from
                    Andrew Phang Boon Leong’s, <em>Cheshire, Fifoot and
                        Furmston’s, Law of Contract Second Singapore and Malaysian
                        Edition</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1998) at p 19 is
                    apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3</b>
                
              <b>The
                                effect of a payment to the agent</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may happen that either the principal or the third party settles with
                        the agent, who, however, by reason of bankruptcy or fraud, fails to pass the
                        money on to the creditor. The question then arises whether the payer is
                        liable to pay over again. There are two separate cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the principal, having instructed his agent to buy goods, pays the
                        purchase price to the agent, who fails to pay the seller.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the principal instructs his agent to sell goods; the agent sells
                        to a buyer and receives payment from him, but does not pay the
                        principal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he general rule is that the principal remains liable to the seller
                            [<em>Irvine v Watson</em> (1879) 5 QBD
                        102].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Accordingly, applying these simple principles,
                    Sulzer remains liable to Sincastle where Sincastle remained unpaid on verified
                    outstanding invoices, notwithstanding any bilateral disputes it might have with
                    Power-Vac under its separate bilateral contract. The terms of payment clause in
                    the Service Agreement when construed in the light of the full factual context of
                    the arrangement between Sincastle and Sulzer does not have the legal effect of
                    exculpating Sulzer from its direct contractual obligation to pay Sincastle on
                    Sulzer’s verified invoices. Sulzer’s decision to route its payment
                    through Power-Vac, which it later turns out Power-Vac had otherwise applied,
                    cannot operate to discharge Sulzer’s payment obligation to Sincastle.
                    Accordingly, Sulzer remains liable to Sincastle for the agreed
                sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In closing, I note that it is surprising that
                    Sulzer did not make Power-Vac a third party to Sincastle’s action against
                    it, pursuant to its independent payment agreement with Power-Vac and
                    Power-Vac’s admission of liability for $66, 711.80 of the agreed sum
                    (above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). Perhaps extraneous factors
                    not before the Court might adequately explain why and how Sulzer and Power-Vac
                    have conducted their respective defence and counter-claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sincastle’s claim against Power-Vac</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As Sincastle’s claim against Power-Vac
                    on a purported oral collateral contract was mounted in the alternative, in the
                    light of my finding in its favour against Sulzer (above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>), I need not consider this prayer
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Power-Vac’s counterclaim against Sincastle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Power-Vac counterclaimed against Sincastle for
                    certain goods and services provided to Sincastle. A total sum of $21,084.00 was
                    claimed pursuant to the following invoices billed to Sincastle:</p>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Invoice No. PV048/09 dated 03/08/2009 for
                            $7000.00 for the transport and consumables provided at the Exxon-Mobil
                            SPA-X project (“transport and
                        consumables”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In relation to Power-Vac’s welding works
                    claim, by way of an open letter from Sincastle’s solicitors to
                    Power-Vac’s solicitors dated 24 June 2011, Sincastle conceded
                    liability to Power-Vac’s claim for $14,084.00</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In relation to Power-Vac’s transport and
                    consumables claim, Sincastle claimed that it had not made any request for
                    transport or consumables for the ExxonMobil SPA-X Project and that in any event,
                    no such service had been supplied by Power-Vac. As no evidence was produced by
                    the counterclaimant of actual transport provided under the invoice tendered, or
                    of equipment supplied under the supporting invoice adduced by Power-Vac, this
                    claim must fail. Further, no attendance records of workers using the alleged
                    transport provided or the transport entering the project site was adduced.
                    Power-Vac was relying on a bare quotation and bare invoice in support of its
                    claim for $7000.00. In fact, in its closing submissions Power Vac stated,
                    “[t]here is <em>no</em> documentary evidence to
                    support the version given by either of the witnesses”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> As the burden
                    fell squarely on Power-Vac and it has not produced satisfactory evidence to
                    establish the same, the transport and consumables claim is
                dismissed.</p>
