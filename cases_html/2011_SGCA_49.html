        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal from the decision of the High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Public Prosecutor
                        v Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam</em> [2011] 2 SLR 830
                        (“<em>Nagaenthran (HC)</em>”) convicting
                    the appellant, Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam, aged 22 years, of the charge
                    set out below. We dismissed the appeal at the conclusion of the hearing. We now
                    give our grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant was charged as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>YOU ARE CHARGED</b> at the instance of the
                        Attorney-General as Public Prosecutor and the charge against you is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, <b>NAGAENTHRAN A/L K DHARMALINGAM</b>, on
                        the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of April 2009, at or about
                        7.45 p.m., at the Woodlands Checkpoint Arrival Motorcycle Lane,
                        Singapore, did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in
                        Class “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs
                        Act, Chapter 185, to wit, one (01) packet of granular substance
                        containing not less than 42.72 grams of diamorphine, without any
                        authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you
                        have thereby committed an offence under section 7 and punishable under
                        section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Judge found on the evidence that the
                    appellant had actual knowledge of the contents of a packet wrapped in newspaper
                    in his possession (“the Bundle”), and that, in the alternative,
                    the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of
                    the controlled drug under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The Judge further found that the
                    appellant could not rely on the defence of duress in s 94 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). Accordingly, he convicted the appellant of the
                    offence charged and sentenced him to death as mandated by s 33 of the MDA
                    read together with the Second Schedule to the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As the facts of this case are set out fully in
                        <em>Nagaenthran (HC)</em>, we do not propose to
                    rehearse them. Briefly, at the material time, the appellant was living in a
                    shared apartment in Johor Bahru with some of his friends (including one Kumarsen
                    and Kumarsen’s wife) and one Shalini, whom the appellant claimed to be his
                    girlfriend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellant testified that he met a Chinese
                    man by the name of King on 21 April 2009, and asked King for a loan of
                    RM500 in order to pay for his father’s heart operation on 23 April
                    2009 in Kuala Lumpur. King agreed. The next day, 22 April 2009, the
                    appellant met King at a food shop in Johor Bahru at about 6.00pm. King handed
                    the appellant what the appellant believed to be a packet of food together with a
                    transparent plastic packet of curry, telling the appellant to deliver those
                    items to a person in Woodlands, Singapore. King gave the appellant a telephone
                    SIM card, and asked the appellant to put the said card into his phone and
                    activate it upon entering Singapore. King also told the appellant to wait in
                    front of a designated “7-Eleven” convenience store, and to give
                    the items to a person in a “dark blue Camry”. After the delivery,
                    the appellant was to return to Malaysia. King told the appellant that he had to
                    complete the delivery of the items before he would lend the RM500 to the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Just as the appellant was about to leave with
                    the said items, King invited him into his (King’s) car, where he told the
                    appellant that he had changed his mind and that he needed the appellant to
                    deliver something else instead. King handed the appellant the Bundle. King said
                    that the Bundle contained “company product” or “company
                    spares”. King told the appellant that the Bundle had to be tied to the
                    appellant’s thigh for the delivery. According to the appellant, he
                    initially resisted King’s request, but King slapped and punched him,
                    threatening that if he refused to deliver the Bundle, King would
                    “finish” and “kill” Shalini (the appellant’s
                    girlfriend). King made the appellant remove one side of his trousers and raise
                    his leg such that it rested on the dashboard of King’s car. Thereafter,
                    King tied the Bundle around the appellant’s left inner thigh with yellow
                    tape. King again instructed the appellant to go to Singapore and put the SIM
                    card into his phone, and wait in front of the designated
                    “7-Eleven” convenience store. As before, King informed the
                    appellant that a “dark blue Camry” would come, that the person in
                    the said Camry would be wearing blue-coloured spectacles, and that the appellant
                    was to hand the Bundle to that person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       King then sent the appellant to the
                    appellant’s apartment to prepare for the delivery trip. When the appellant
                    alighted from King’s car, the appellant telephoned Kumarsen and told
                    Kumarsen that he had to take some money to Singapore. Kumarsen agreed to give
                    him a ride. The appellant returned to his room in the apartment and put on a
                    pair of trousers which belonged to one Tamilselvam (Kumarsen’s nephew, who
                    was staying in the appellant’s room). Because Tamilselvam was much bigger
                    sized than the appellant, the appellant had to use a belt to secure the fit.
                    According to the appellant, he wore Tamilselvam’s trousers because King
                    had told him to wear bigger trousers as it was important that what was in the
                    Bundle was not damaged. Although Shalini, Tamilselvam and one Ramesh were in the
                    apartment at that time, the appellant testified that he did not tell any of them
                    what King had done or said to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Kumarsen rode his motorcycle, with the appellant
                    riding pillion, to the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint. At about 7.45pm, the
                    appellant and Kumarsen were stopped at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint by
                    the passport screening officer and taken to an office. In the office, the
                    appellant called Shalini. The appellant and Kumarsen were thereafter brought to
                    different rooms by various officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau
                    (“CNB”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Staff Sergeant Syed Anis Bin Syed Omar
                    Alsree (“SSgt Anis”), a CNB officer, commenced the strip
                    search of the appellant in room C526. During the strip search, the appellant was
                    asked by SSgt Anis to remove his trousers, which he did. At this point,
                    SSgt Anis saw the Bundle secured to the appellant’s left inner thigh
                    with yellow tape over the red pair of boxer briefs that he was wearing. Later,
                    Sergeant Muhd Zaid Bin Adam and Sergeant Shahrulnizam s/o Abdullah
                    (“Sgt Shahrulnizam”) entered the room and SSgt Anis left
                    the room. Sgt Shahrulnizam spoke to the appellant in Tamil, handcuffed him,
                    and then proceeded to remove the Bundle from the appellant’s thigh. While
                    doing so, part of the Bundle’s newspaper wrapping tore, enabling
                    Sgt Shahrulnizam to see that the Bundle contained a transparent plastic bag
                    with white granular substance in it. The white granular substance was
                    subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 42.72g of
                    heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the trial, the appellant disputed the
                    Prosecution’s evidence as to what exactly had happened after
                    Sgt Shahrulnizam had removed the Bundle. The appellant’s version of
                    events was that Sgt Shahrulnizam asked him what was in the Bundle, and he
                    replied that he did not know. Sgt Shahrulnizam said “<em>thool</em>” (a Tamil word colloquially used to mean
                    “powder” or, more precisely, drugs), slapped the appellant on the
                    right and left cheeks, punched the appellant in the chest area just above the
                    stomach and uttered a vulgarity. Sgt Shahrulnizam again told the appellant
                    that the Bundle contained “<em>thool</em>”,
                    and the appellant again denied knowledge of the contents of the Bundle.
                    Thereafter, Sgt Shahrulnizam put the contents of the Bundle into two bags
                    and left the room with the bags.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the trial, Sgt Shahrulnizam testified
                    that after he had removed the Bundle from the appellant’s thigh, he had
                    pointed to the Bundle and asked the appellant, “What is this?”, to
                    which the appellant had replied in English, “Heroin”.
                    Sgt Shahrulnizam denied assaulting the appellant, using vulgarities on him,
                    or trying to make him admit that the Bundle contained heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At about 12.10am on 23 April 2009,
                    Sgt Shahrulnizam handed the seized exhibits to Sergeant Vasanthakumar
                    Pillai s/o M M Iruthaya Nathen Pillai
                    (“Sgt Vasanthakumar”) for the purpose of recording statements
                    from the appellant and Kumarsen in room C527 of the CNB’s Woodlands Team
                    C5 office. Sgt Vasanthakumar recorded Kumarsen’s statement first, and
                    later recorded the appellant’s statement between 1.20am and 1.35am. The
                    material portions of the appellant’s statement recorded by
                    Sgt Vasanthakumar read:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the trial, the appellant confirmed that he
                    had given his statement voluntarily to Sgt Vasanthakumar, that no one had
                    threatened or promised him anything <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    giving of the statement, and that he had signed the statement as recorded. He
                    did not challenge its admissibility. However, he challenged the accuracy of the
                    statement. He testified, with regard to Q1 (above), that Sgt Vasanthakumar
                    had said to him: “[y]ou know that this is heroin, right?”, to
                    which he had replied that he did not know. Later, when Sgt Vasanthakumar
                    asked him again: “[w]hat is this”, he had replied: “Sir,
                    Mr Shah [<em>ie</em>, Sgt Shahrulnizam] said that
                    it was heroin. It is <em>thool</em> but I do not know what
                    it is”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sgt Vasanthakumar, on the other hand,
                    testified that he was certain that the appellant had merely stated that the
                    white granular substance in the Bundle was “heroin” without
                    qualifying that Sgt Shahrulnizam had earlier suggested it to him.
                    Sgt Vasanthakumar also testified that he had read back the recorded
                    statement to the appellant, including mentioning the word “heroin”
                    as recorded, and the appellant had signed the statement
                voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At about 6.02am on 23 April 2009,
                    Assistant Superintendent Sivaraman Letchumanan recorded the
                    appellant’s cautioned statement, the material part of which is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was forced and sent into Singapore. I had borrowed money on interest. My
                        father is undergoing an operation this morning. I went and asked the same
                        person an additional RM500/-. And he told me to deliver something. First he
                        gave me a package with Roti Channai and gravy. As I was leaving the shop, he
                        called me by my name ‘Raja’ and requested me to return to the
                        shop. He asked me to remove my pants and he placed a bundle wrapped up in
                        Chinese Newspaper on my left upper thigh and he used a tape and taped the
                        packet around my thigh. He went 3 time round. I asked him “what is
                        this” and he told me it is for your safety and the thing will be
                        save. He is a male chinese known to me as ‘King’. I did not know
                        what was inside the package and only when it was opened up, one of the sirs
                        told me it was Heroin. The rider of the motorcycle does not know anything
                        about this. I was threatened that if I didn’t return the money, they
                        will knock down my girlfriend using a car. That is all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the basis of the evidence before him, the
                    Judge made the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the appellant had actual knowledge
                        that the Bundle contained heroin;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption that he
                        knew the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA as his evidence
                        that he thought the Bundle contained “company spares” or
                        “company product” was not credible; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     the defence of duress was not made out
                        on the balance of probabilities, and, in any case, even if the
                        appellant’s evidence were believed, it did not suffice to establish
                        duress under the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The same issues of law and fact that were
                    canvassed below were reiterated before us. We considered, first, the issue of
                    the appellant’s knowledge of what was in the Bundle. At [33] of <em>Nagaenthran
                        (HC)</em>, the Judge said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he [appellant] was in possession of the Bundle when he was
                        stopped at Woodlands Checkpoint in Singapore. However, the degree or extent
                        of the [appellant’s] knowledge of what exactly was inside the Bundle
                        wrapped in newspaper was disputed. In the course of its submissions, the
                        Prosecution endeavoured to make out a positive case, beyond reasonable doubt
                        based on the available evidence, that the [appellant] did have actual
                        knowledge or imputed knowledge (by virtue of wilful blindness) of the actual
                        contents of the Bundle at the material time of the offence. I accepted that
                        the statements made to the CNB officers had been accurately recorded. The
                        statements, admitted by the [appellant] to be voluntarily given to the CNB
                        officers, showed that the [appellant] had actual knowledge that the Bundle
                        contained heroin, and not merely some kind of controlled drug the nature of
                        which was unknown to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the established principle that an appellate
                    court would not interfere with a trial judge’s findings of fact unless
                    they were plainly wrong (<em>eg</em>, contrary to the
                    evidence), we held that we had no basis to disagree with the Judge’s
                    factual findings. In fact, looking at the evidence adduced at the trial, we were
                    convinced that the appellant had actual knowledge that the Bundle he was
                    carrying contained heroin. The Judge further held that if his finding of actual
                    knowledge was wrong, then he would find that the appellant had failed to rebut
                    the presumption of knowledge – also relied upon by the Prosecution as its
                    alternative submission – under s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At [34] of <em>Nagaenthran (HC)</em>, the
                    Judge explained why he rejected the appellant’s defence of duress (a
                    finding with which we agreed):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My reasons are as follows. The version of facts that the Defence had put
                        forth in support of the [appellant’s] defence of duress were
                        inextricably the same alleged facts relied upon to show that the [appellant]
                        lacked knowledge of the actual contents found in the Bundle. The [appellant]
                        alleged that he was forced by King to deliver the Bundle containing
                        “company spares” or “company product” (not
                        heroin) to King’s brother in Singapore as he feared for
                        Shalini’s life. For reasons already given, I did not accept the
                        [appellant’s] version of facts to be true, in particular the alleged
                        fact that King had assaulted the [appellant] and threatened to kill Shalini
                        if the [appellant] refused to (a) let King strap onto his left thigh
                        the Bundle, which King told him contained “company spares” or
                        “company product” and (b) deliver the strapped Bundle to
                        King’s “brother” in Singapore. <em>On
                            this basis alone, the Defence was therefore left with no other credible
                            evidence upon which to discharge the burden of proof placed on the
                            [appellant] to rebut the presumption imposed by s 18(2) of the
                            MDA</em>, ie<em>, that the [appellant] knew that
                            the Bundle found in his possession in fact contained heroin</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the appellant had the requisite knowledge for finding
                liability under section 7 of the MDA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The presumption as to the nature of the controlled drug in
                section 18(2) of the MDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 18(2) of the MDA provides that a
                    person who is proved or presumed to be in possession of a controlled drug under
                    s 18(1) of the MDA is also presumed to know “the nature of that
                    drug”. In the present case, the Judge found that the appellant knew that
                    the Bundle found in his possession in fact contained heroin. In making this
                    finding, he equated the phrase “the nature of that drug” in
                    s 18(2) with the actual drug that was found in the Bundle. We agree with
                    the Judge’s approach in the interpretation of that phrase. But, as some
                    uncertainty persists as to the meaning of the term “controlled
                    drug” in s 18(2) of the MDA (which has arisen from the judgment of
                    this court in <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>”)), it is desirable that we clarify the approach which a
                    court should adopt in applying s 18(2) of the MDA to the facts of a
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Section 18 of the MDA provides as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>Tan Kiam
                    Peng</em>, this court embarked on an extended discussion of whether the
                    term “controlled drug” in s 18(2) of the MDA should be given
                    a narrow or a broad meaning (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at
                    [83]–[95]). The broad interpretation is that “knowledge in
                    s 18(2) … is only a reference to knowledge that the drug concerned
                    is a controlled drug” (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at
                    [83]), and not knowledge that the drug in question is the actual drug found in
                    the possession of the accused (<em>ibid</em>). The narrow
                    interpretation is that the knowledge referred to in s 18(2) of the MDA is
                    the “knowledge that the drug is <em>not only</em> a
                    controlled drug <em>but is also</em> the <b><em>specific</em></b><em>drug</em> which it turns out the accused was in
                    possession of” [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold
                    italics] (see <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [90]). At [95], the
                    court concluded that the narrow interpretation was to be preferred:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [G]iven the specific language of s 18(2) of the [MDA], the
                        need (given the extreme penalties prescribed by the [MDA]) to resolve any
                        ambiguities in interpretation (if they exist) in favour of the accused, as
                        well as the fact that no case has (to the best of our knowledge) adopted the
                        [broad] interpretation, it would appear, in our view, that (whilst not
                        expressing a conclusive view in the absence of detailed argument) the
                        [narrow] interpretation appears to be the more persuasive one and …
                        will in fact be adopted in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In our view, while there may be a conceptual
                    distinction between the broad view (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the
                    MDA refers to knowledge that the drug is a controlled drug) and the narrow view
                    (that the knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA refers to knowledge that the drug
                    is a specific controlled drug, <em>eg</em>, heroin or
                    “ice”), the distinction has no practical significance for the
                    purposes of rebutting the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the
                    controlled drug. To rebut the presumption of knowledge, all the accused has to
                    do is to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he <em>did
                        not know</em> the nature of the controlled drug referred to in the
                    charge. The material issue in s 18(2) of the MDA is <em>not</em> the <em>existence</em> of the
                    accused’s knowledge of the controlled drug, <em>but</em> the <em>non-existence</em> of such
                    knowledge on his part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As to the meaning of the phrase “the
                    nature of that drug”, our view is that it refers to the actual controlled
                    drug found in the “thing” (<em>eg</em>, the
                    bag or container, <em>etc</em>) that was in the possession
                    of the accused at the material time. For instance, if heroin is found in a bag
                    or a container in the accused’s possession and he is unable to prove, on a
                    balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge of that heroin (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> below), he would be presumed under
                    s 18(2) of the MDA to have known of the heroin in his
                possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, as the appellant was
                    found to be in possession of the Bundle containing a controlled drug, he was
                    presumed to have had that drug in his possession under s 18(1) of the MDA
                    (by virtue of his possession of the Bundle) unless he proved the contrary. He
                    was unable to do so because he could not prove that he had no knowledge of the
                    Bundle or the contents of the Bundle. In fact, he knew the Bundle strapped to
                    his thigh contained something (which he alleged to be “company
                    product”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Consequently, the s 18(2) presumption
                applied, and the appellant was presumed to have known the nature of the
                    aforesaid (controlled) drug (which he was presumed to have had in his
                    possession), unless he proved the contrary. He was again unable to do so because
                    the Judge rejected his defence that he believed or thought that the Bundle
                    contained “company product”, and found that he had actual
                    knowledge that the Bundle contained heroin. We should add that the presumption
                    in s 18(2) of the MDA also applies to a case where the accused is <em>proved</em> to have been in <em>possession</em> of a <em>controlled drug</em>,
                        <em>eg</em>, where the accused knew or was wilfully
                    blind to the fact that he was carrying a controlled drug. Another illustration
                    of proven possession, without the aid of the presumption in s 18(1) of the
                    MDA, would be where the accused has direct possession of a controlled drug (as
                    opposed to possession of something containing a controlled drug, the keys of
                    something containing a controlled drug, <em>etc</em>),
                        <em>eg</em>, where the accused has some white pills in
                    his trouser pocket (whatever he believed them to be) that turn out to be a
                    controlled drug. Ultimately, regardless of whether possession is <em>proved</em> or <em>presumed</em>,
                    s 18(2) of the MDA would apply to presume that the accused knew the nature
                    of that drug, unless he proves the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     How can an accused rebut the presumption of
                    knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug found in his possession
                        (<em>eg</em>, in a bag he is carrying or on his
                    person)? He can do so by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he
                    genuinely believed that what was in his possession was something innocuous
                        (<em>eg</em>, washing powder, when it was in fact
                    heroin (see <em>Warner v Metropolitan Police
                        Commissioner</em> [1969] 2 AC 256)), or that he thought it was a
                    controlled drug other than the one actually found in his possession (<em>eg</em>, where he genuinely believed he was carrying
                    “ice”, rather than heroin (see <em>Khor Soon Lee v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 201)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Whether the accused’s evidence is to be
                    believed is a question to be determined in all the circumstances of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Actual knowledge and wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the present case, the Judge did not make a
                    finding that the appellant was wilfully blind. He did not need to, as he had
                    already found that the appellant had actual knowledge that the Bundle contained
                    heroin. We agreed with the Judge’s finding that the appellant had actual
                    knowledge that the Bundle he was carrying contained heroin. Accordingly, the
                    appellant was properly convicted under s 7 of the MDA. Nonetheless, we
                    think it will be useful to make some observations on the concept and role of
                    wilful blindness in the context of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>
                    at [141], this court held that s 18(2) of the MDA included both <em>actual knowledge</em> in its “purest form”
                    (also referred to as “actual knowledge <em>simpliciter</em>” in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Lim Boon Hiong and another</em> [2010] 4 SLR 696) as well as
                        <em>wilful blindness</em>. However, one must be careful
                    to avoid unnecessary refinement of the <em>mens rea</em> of
                    knowledge. Wilful blindness (or “Nelsonian blindness”) is merely
                    “lawyer-speak” for <em>actual knowledge</em>
                    that is <em>inferred</em> from the circumstances of the
                    case. It is an indirect way to prove actual knowledge; <em>ie</em>, actual knowledge is proved because the inference of
                    knowledge is <em>irresistible</em> and is the <em>only rational inference</em> available <em>on
                        the facts</em> (see <em>Pereira v Director of Public
                        Prosecutions</em> [1988] 63 ALJR 1 at 3). It is a subjective
                    concept, in that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of the
                        <em>accused</em> and not that which might be postulated
                    of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused (although this
                    last-mentioned point may not be an irrelevant consideration) (<em>ibid</em>). Wilful blindness is not negligence or an inadvertent
                    failure to make inquiries. It refers to the blindness of a person to facts
                    which, in the relevant context, he <em>deliberately
                        refuses</em> to inquire into. Such failure to inquire may sustain an
                    inference of knowledge of the actual or likely existence of the relevant drug.
                    It must also be emphasised that where the Prosecution seeks to rely on actual
                    knowledge in the form of wilful blindness, the alleged wilful blindness must be
                    proved <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In so far as <em>rebutting</em> the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge is
                    concerned, we have stated earlier that the accused only needs to prove that he
                    had no knowledge of the <em>nature</em> of the controlled
                    drug. Consistent with the burden which he has to discharge, the accused has to
                    adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate, on a <em>balance of
                        probabilities</em>, that he did not know the <em>nature</em> of that drug. This is a question of fact in each case,
                    and turns very much on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of
                    the defence witnesses (especially that of the accused, if he chooses to
                    testify).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was duress</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We turn now to the appellant’s defence
                    of duress under s 94 of the Penal Code. The Judge rejected this defence on
                    the evidence before him. He found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no credible evidence of a
                        threat to kill Shalini; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>even if</em> there was such a
                        threat, it could not be said that it had “reasonably cause[d] the
                        apprehension that instant death to … [Shalini] w[ould] otherwise be
                        the consequence [of non-compliance with King’s request to deliver the
                        Bundle]”, as is required under s 94.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We agreed with the Judge’s finding that
                    on the facts, there was no duress under s 94 of the Penal
                Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The appeal was accordingly
                dismissed.</p>
