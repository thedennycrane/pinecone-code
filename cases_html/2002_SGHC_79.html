<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns="">1.    The district judge had explained in her judgment that it was

  because of the fact that the husband had to support the younger son that she apportioned

  to him 60% share of the matrimonial assets instead of the 50% share that she would

  otherwise have allowed. The district judge did not factor into that apportionment the

  husband's obligation to maintain the wife. This is understandable as maintenance payments

  are not ordinarily taken into account in determining the distribution of matrimonial

  assets. </p>
<p xmlns="">2.    However, where the husband is of relatively advanced age and

  unemployed and where the reality is that the only source of sustenance for him at present

  and in the years to come would be from his share of the matrimonial assets, there does not

  seem to be any reason why the court should not factor the obligation to pay maintenance in

  determining the apportionment of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Nevertheless, in this present case, the wife will not, in fact,

  obtain the bulk of her share of the other matrimonial assets, in particular her share of

  the monies in her husband's CPF account until he is 55 years of age. It thus seems

  appropriate that until such time as the wife obtains her full share of the matrimonial

  assets, the husband should be required to maintain her. Therefore, while the apportionment

  in the ratio of 60 : 40 by the district judge is to be upheld, the $300 per month

  maintenance is ordered to be payable only up to June 2005 by which time her 40 % share in

  the husband's CPF funds would have been released to her and she would have received in

  full her share of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    As for the quantification of other matrimonial assets, there was

  merit in the husband's submissions. It was not appropriate in this case for the court to

  fix the value of the other matrimonial assets and require one party to pay to the other

  party in cash the share of the other party. All the court can do (in the absence of

  consent) is to order the sale of the assets so that the sale proceeds can be apportioned

  between them. The order of the district judge ordering the husband to pay the wife the sum

  of $150,000 was set aside and specific orders (some of them by consent) were made in

  relation to each of the other matrimonial assets.</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    The parties to this appeal were married in 1973. A decree

nisi dissolving their marriage was granted on an uncontested basis on 17 November

2000. There were two sons to the marriage – the elder is now aged 26 years and the

younger is 15 years. Custody of the younger son was, by consent, granted to both parties

with care and control to the husband. The only areas of dispute in the court below related

to the apportionment of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the wife

("ancillary matters"). The matrimonial assets consisted of an HDB flat

("the matrimonial flat"), the husband’s CPF savings, property in Malaysia,

shares listed on the Stock Exchanges of Singapore and Malaysia, various bank accounts and

club memberships ("the other matrimonial assets").

<p xmlns="">2.    The ancilliary matters were heard by the District Judge on 13 and

14 August 2001. At the conclusion of the hearing the District Judge made the following

orders: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) The husband shall have an option to purchase the rights, interests

  and title of the wife in the matrimonial flat by paying the wife 40% of the value of the

  flat; the value shall be obtained from an agreed valuer on the basis of open market sale;

  the husband shall bear the costs of the sale and the option shall be exercised within

  one month from the date of the order.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) If the option is not exercised within the stated period, the

  matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market and the proceeds of sale, after

  deducting the costs and expenses of the sale, shall be divided in the proportion of 60% to

  the husband and 40% to the wife. The husband shall refund his Central Provident Fund

  ("CPF") account of monies used for the flat with accrued interest from his

  share.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The husband shall also pay the wife a sum of $150,000 (being about

  40% of the value of $375,680) as her share in the other matrimonial assets.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) The husband shall pay the wife the amount of $300 a month as her

  maintenance with effect from 15 August 2001 and on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of every

  month thereafter, into a bank account of the wife.</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The husband, through his then solicitors, filed a Notice of Appeal.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    I heard the appeal on 29 November 2001, 15 and 19 April 2002. The

husband appeared in person. His submissions fell into two broad categories: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) That the apportionment of the matrimonial assets in the ratio 60:40

  should be varied in his favour or, alternatively, he should not be required to pay

  maintenance to the wife.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) That, in respect of the other matrimonial assets, the District

  Judge ought not to have quantified the 40% payable to the wife at $150,000.</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I will deal with each of these submissions in turn.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The apportionment of the matrimonial assets</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">4.    The husband is in his early 50s and has been unemployed for a

while. He vehemently denied the submission by Ms Jasvendar Kaur, counsel for the wife,

that his unemployment was self-imposed. He has, he said, tried hard to get employment but,

inspite of his many years of experience in the electronic and mechanical engineering

trade, his age was against him and he could not secure employment even at in lower

positions and at considerably reduced wages. Being unemployed, the only way he could

support himself and his younger son (and pay the monthly maintenance to his wife) was to

utilise his share of the matrimonial assets to generate sufficient income or, failing

that, dip into his capital (ie his share of the matrimonial assets).</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    The husband argued that just as he had to support himself (and his

younger son) from his 60% share of the matrimonial assets, so too could the wife support

herself from her 40% share of the matrimonial assets. He argued that the District Judge,

in ordering him to pay maintenance to his wife, had not sufficiently taken into account

the fact that whilst his share of the matrimonial assets had to be utilised for himself

and his younger son, the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets was only for herself.

He therefore urged the court to either grant him a greater share of the matrimonial assets

or reduce/cancel the maintenance payable to the wife.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Miss Kaur pointed out that the Notice of Appeal did not

specifically cover maintenance and submitted that, unless the court granted leave to the

husband to appeal out of time, the court should not vary the apportionment of the

matrimonial assets to reflect the obligation on the husband to maintain the wife or

entertain any submissions on maintenance. It could well be argued, as the husband did in

this case, that the apportionment of matrimonial assets and the provision of maintenance

were inter-connected and that an appeal on the apportionment would necessarily involve an

appeal on the maintenance. But even if that was not so, I was prepared to grant the

husband leave to raise the question of maintenance.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    In her Grounds of Judgment, the District Judge explained that it

was because of the fact that the husband would have to support his younger son that she

apportioned to him 60% share of the matrimonial assets instead of the 50% share that she

would otherwise have allowed. The District Judge did not factor into that apportionment

the husband’s obligation to maintain the wife. This is understandable as maintenance

payments are not ordinarily taken into account in determining how matrimonial assets are

to be distributed. However, in a case like this – where the husband is of relatively

advanced age and unemployed and where the reality is that the only source of sustenance

for him at present and in the years to come would be from his share of the matrimonial

assets – there does not seem to be any reason why the court should not factor the

obligation to pay maintenance into the equation in determining the apportionment of the

matrimonial assets.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    In the present case, however, the wife will, in fact,

not obtain the bulk of her share of the other matrimonial assets –

in particular her share of what is in the husband’s CPF account – until the

husband attains the age of 55 years, which is still some 3 years away. It seems to me

appropriate that until such time as the wife obtains her full share of the matrimonial

assets, the husband should be required to maintain her. Thereafter she and the husband can

meet their financial needs from their respective shares in the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    I therefore upheld the decision of the District Judge that the

matrimonial assets be apportioned in the ratio 60:40 but ordered that the $300 per month

maintenance ordered by the District Judge be payable to the wife only up to June 2005 by

which time her 40% share in the husband’s CPF funds would have been released to her

and she would have received in full her share of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Quantifying the "other matrimonial assets"</p></b></u>.

<p xmlns="">10.    The District Judge had not quantified the value of the

matrimonial flat: its value was to be dependent on the price it fetched when sold. This

was as it should be. In respect of the "other matrimonial assets" however, the

District Judge quantified the value of each asset as follows:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">Having arrived at the nett value of $375,680 the District Judge rounded

off the wife’s 40% share of the nett assets at $150,000 and ordered the husband to

pay that sum to the wife.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    The husband, at the hearing of this appeal, pointed out that he

just did not have cash anywhere near $150,000 with which to comply with the order made

against him. He pointed out that the amount of $61,450 stated to be in his CPF ordinary

account and $140,004 stated to be in his CPF investment account could not be withdrawn by

him until he reached the age of 55 years. He further pointed out that figure of $409,880

adopted by the District Judge as the gross value of the other matrimonial assets was a

mere estimate and until the assets were actually realised the value would be just

conjecture. In that context, he pointed out that the property market and the share market

had in recent times suffered rapid decline and the values adopted by the District Judge

were just not realistic. A fairer order for the District Judge to have made,

he submitted, would have been – as she did in respect of the matrimonial flat

– to order that the other matrimonial assets be sold within a time-span prescribed by

the court and the proceeds apportioned between him and the wife in the ratio of 60:40.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    There was merit in the husband’s submission. It was not

appropriate, in this case, for the court to fix the value of the other matrimonial assets

and require one party to pay to the other party in cash the share of the other party. All

that the court can do (in the absence of consent) is order the sale of the assets so that

the sale proceeds can be apportioned between them.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    For the above reason I set aside the order of the District Judge

ordering the husband to pay the wife the sum of $150,000 and made specific orders (some of

them by consent) in relation to each asset. In respect of the CPF investment account, I

authorised the husband to sell the shares held in that account and I further authorised

the wife to place a charge on the funds in the CPF ordinary account and the

CPF investment account in order to secure her 40% interest. As for the Mewah View

Condominium, I ordered the husband to sell the property within 6 months and pay 40% of the

nett sale proceeds to the wife in Malaysian Ringgit. As for the memberships in the Chinese

Swimming Club and the Penang Club (of which he was an absent member), the husband was

prepared to pay to the wife 40% of the value determined by the District Judge. In respect

of the Pinetree Club, I accepted the submission of the husband that as a result of recent

events the membership was no longer marketable and so could not be given any value.</p>
