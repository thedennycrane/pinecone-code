<p class="Judg-Author">
        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In land-scarce Singapore, a home is often a
                    family’s most prized possession. As a result, perceived interference with
                    its use or enjoyment can provoke strong emotions. Homeowners, quite naturally,
                    experience deep indignation when they feel that their “entrenched
                    rights” are violated by a neighbour. This, in turn, often induces such
                    homeowners to react obdurately to that neighbour’s
                    “high-handed” conduct. What inevitably follows is a cantankerous
                    contest of wills that leaves in its wake a sour aftertaste.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Undoubtedly, it is preferable that such
                    differences between neighbours be resolved by the application of neighbourly
                    common sense based upon the golden maxim of “do unto your neighbour as
                    you would have your neighbour do unto you”, rather than based upon strict
                    legal principles. The ethic of reasonable “give and take” ought to
                    be the touchstone. If that cannot be invoked, it is always desirable to have
                    such disputes resolved by mediation rather than by the courts. Nevertheless,
                    when one or both parties insist on maintaining their strict legal rights
                    (whether mistakenly or otherwise), mediation will not work, as in this matter.
                    Acknowledging this, we have taken some pains in this judgment to explain and
                    clarify the law on easements in the form of private rights of way to assist
                    others in resolving similar issues in future. From that point of view, some good
                    has come out of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Of the two appeals before us, Civil Appeal
                    No 103 of 2011 (“CA 103”) arises from the decision of
                    the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in Originating Summons
                    No 85 of 2011 (“OS 85”), while Civil Appeal No 151
                    of 2011 (“CA 151”) arises from the Judge’s decision in
                    Originating Summons No 350 of 2011 (“OS 350”).
                    OS 85 and OS 350 were filed by the appellants in both appeals, Wee
                    Siew Bock (“Wee”) and his wife, Chia Foong Lin (collectively
                    referred to hereafter as “the Appellants”), against the respondent
                    in both appeals, Chan Yuen Yee Alexia Eve (“the Respondent”). At
                    the heart of these appeals is a fractious dispute between two neighbouring
                    landowners about the extent of their respective rights in relation to an
                    easement granted in favour of the Appellants over part of the land belonging to
                    the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Some
                    interesting legal issues have arisen. What is the true extent of the rights that
                    each of these owners has over the land that is affected by the easement? How
                    does the law strike an appropriate balance between the rights of a dominant
                    owner (<em>viz</em>, the owner of a dominant tenement)
                        <em>apropos</em> those of a servient owner (<em>viz</em>, the owner of a servient tenement)? For ease of
                    discussion, we shall hereafter use the expression “easement land”
                    to refer generically to that part of a servient tenement which is affected by an
                    easement, the expression “the Easement Land” to refer specifically
                    to the easement land in issue in the present appeals and the expression
                    “the Easement” to refer to the easement granted in favour of the
                    Appellants over the Easement Land. We shall also use the terms
                    “use”, “usage” and “enjoyment”
                    interchangeably in discussing the exercise by a landowner of his rights over his
                    land and the exercise by a dominant owner of his rights under an
                    easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plots of land involved</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       All the parcels of land in issue in the present
                    appeals are registered under the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev
                    Ed) (“the LTA”). The Appellants have been the registered
                    proprietors of the dominant tenement, No 22 Oei Tiong Ham Park,
                    Singapore 267027 (“No 22”), since 2 January 2003,
                    while the Respondent has been the registered proprietor of the servient
                    tenement, No 23 Oei Tiong Ham Park, Singapore 267028
                    (“No 23”), since 14 April 2005. The plot of land on
                    which No 22 stands originally comprised two parcels of land, and its
                    boundaries were approved on 15 October 1968. As for the plot of land on
                    which No 23 stands, its boundaries were approved on 20 July 1960. Both
                    parties reside at present in their respective properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The disputes in both appeals revolve around the
                    Easement, which is a registered easement conferring on “the Owner of the
                    time being of [No 22] … a right of way at all times for all purposes
                    over and along the [Easement] [L]and”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and the right to
                    “construct lay and use any drains pipes and cables on over or under the
                    [Easement] [L]and and hereditaments hereby conveyed”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Of these two rights, it is the right of way over the Easement Land which the
                    present appeals turn on, and the references hereafter to the use or, conversely,
                    the abandonment of the Easement should be understood in this light. The Easement
                    Land is stated in the transfer dated 28 June 1983 to have a length of
                    approximately 30m and a width of 8m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> These are generous measurements. For
                    perspective, we should add that two ordinary domestic vehicles can, even today
                    (after the completion of all the reconstruction works described in this
                    judgment), comfortably pass each other in opposite directions on the Easement
                    Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In terms of the physical state of the Easement
                    Land, it consists mainly of a paved driveway (“the Driveway”),
                    which is the only means of access for both parties from their respective
                    properties to the public road at Oei Tiong Ham Park. For ease of reference, we
                    shall use the phrase “the end of the Easement Land” to refer to
                    that part of the Easement Land adjoining the gates of No 22 and No 23,
                    and the phrase “the entrance of the Easement Land” to refer to
                    that part of the Easement Land adjoining the public road at Oei Tiong Ham Park.
                    At the end of the Easement Land on the right-hand side of the Driveway
                        (<em>ie</em>, on the side nearer to No 23), there
                    is a raised kerb with a grass verge on which now stand three mature trees and a
                    wall (“the Kerb Wall”). The Respondent’s assertion that
                    these trees have been growing at the same area of the Easement Land for
                    approximately the past 20 years<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> is
                    not disputed by the Appellants. On the left-hand side of the Driveway (<em>ie</em>, on the side nearer to No 22) is a narrow strip
                    of grass. At the entrance of the Easement Land, there is at present an automatic
                    remote-controlled gate (“the Auto-Gate”), with a meter box and a
                    pedestrian access gate to the right of the Auto-Gate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       We now set out in some detail the facts which
                    set in motion the chain of events that precipitated these appeals. This will
                    give context to the legal issues that have arisen for resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In mid-2010, both parties concurrently
                    commenced, without any prior notice to each other, reconstruction works at their
                    respective properties. As the true extent of these works was revealed inchmeal,
                    the seeds of mistrust between the parties began to take deep root. Their
                    relationship soured and communications ceased, eventually triggering a flurry of
                    legal proceedings by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As part of the reconstruction works in relation
                    to No 23, the Respondent planned to install an automatic remote-controlled
                    gate (<em>viz</em>, the Auto-Gate) at the entrance of the
                    Easement Land. She offered the Appellants equal access to the Easement Land by
                    means of a remote control and a set of manual keys for the Auto-Gate. (As will
                    be seen at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> below, the Respondent also
                    offered to take other measures to allay the Appellants’ concerns about the
                    installation of the Auto-Gate.) However, this plan was strenuously objected to
                    by the Appellants, who insisted that the Respondent was not entitled to close
                    the Auto-Gate at any time. On the Appellants’ part, they wanted to lay
                    utility pipes and cables below the Easement Land as well as shift the position
                    of No 22’s gate along the Driveway towards the end of the Easement
                    Land. This shift eventually took place. There is some disagreement in these
                    proceedings between the parties about the precise distance by which
                    No 22’s gate was moved, with the Respondent saying that it was a
                    100cm shift, while the Appellants place the figure at 70cm. We shall return to
                    this point later as it has a bearing on one of the Appellants’ most
                    spirited complaints (see below at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>). The Respondent objected to the
                    Appellants’ plan to relocate No 22’s gate, citing safety
                    concerns for pedestrians and vehicles alike due to the creation of a blind spot
                    and a reduced vehicular turning circle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She additionally complained that
                    her property (No 23) had been damaged when the vehicle of the
                    Appellants’ contractor collided into her brick gate post.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She also objected to the
                    Appellants’ laying of utility pipes and cables under the Easement Land
                    without adequate prior notification because this affected her own reconstruction
                    plans, such as her plan to build a porch and an angled wall (collectively
                    referred to hereafter as a “P&amp;A wall”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellants did not view the Respondent’s concerns sympathetically and
                    concluded that she was acting in a high-handed manner. Communications between
                    the parties became brusque and then ceased altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To resolve this impasse, the Respondent filed
                    Originating Summons No 46 of 2011 (“OS 46”) on
                    20 January 2011. She sought the following orders: (a) an injunction to
                    stop the Appellants from laying utility pipes and cables under the Easement Land
                    without first providing her with detailed plans and drawings of the intended
                    works; (b) a declaration that the Appellants did not have the right to lay
                    utility pipes and cables under the Easement Land in any manner that they deemed
                    fit, but could only do so in a manner that did not cause undue interference with
                    her reasonable enjoyment of No 23; (c) a declaration that the
                    Appellants’ relocation of No 22’s gate was in excess of their
                    rights under the Easement; (d) a mandatory injunction directing the
                    Appellants to either restore No 22’s gate to its original position or
                    take other measures to ensure that the changed position of No 22’s
                    gate did not pose any danger to her (the Respondent) and her family, and did not
                    cause undue interference with her reasonable enjoyment of No 23; and
                    (e) a declaration that she was entitled to install the
                        Auto-Gate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It must be noted here
                    that the decision in OS 46 is not the subject of either of the present
                    appeals and has not been appealed against.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Shortly after OS 46 was filed, the
                    Appellants learnt about the Respondent’s intention to build a P&amp;A wall
                    on the boundary of the Easement Land opposite No 22’s gate. Concerned
                    that this would obstruct their use of the Easement, the Appellants filed
                    OS 85 on 2 February 2011 to compel the Respondent to disclose her
                    plans in relation to the building of the proposed P&amp;A wall and to desist
                    from carrying out the building works unless and until the plans had been
                    provided. Specifically, they sought the following reliefs: (a) a mandatory
                    injunction directing the Respondent to disclose her reconstruction plans for
                    No 23, especially in relation to the building of the proposed P&amp;A wall;
                    (b) a declaration that the proposed P&amp;A wall was an unauthorised
                    encroachment on the Easement Land; (c) a mandatory injunction directing the
                    Respondent to redesign and, if necessary, rebuild the proposed P&amp;A wall
                    “or any other structure near the Easement [Land] so that the Easement
                    [Land] will not be encroached upon”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and (d) an injunction
                    restraining the Respondent from constructing the proposed P&amp;A wall unless
                    and until she had provided them (the Appellants) with detailed plans and
                    drawings evidencing that the Easement Land would not be encroached
                        upon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     OS 85 and OS 46 were heard together
                    by the Judge on 31 March 2011 and 6 April 2011. During the hearing on
                    31 March 2011, counsel for the Respondent disclosed that the Respondent had
                    decided not to build the proposed P&amp;A wall after all, but was instead
                    planning to construct a 1.8m wall (<em>ie</em>, the Kerb
                    Wall mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) to replace the
                    flower trough which then stood along No 23’s wall. On 6 April
                    2011, the Judge delivered his oral judgment for OS 85 and OS 46
                    (“the 6 April 2011 Oral Judgment”). <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the Respondent’s prayer in OS 46 for a
                    declaration that she was entitled to build the Auto-Gate (which was
                    prayer 6 of OS 46), the Judge expressly stated that he was not making
                    any order as he did not think it was necessary (see [14] of the 6 April 2011
                    Oral Judgment). However, he also expressly stated his view (likewise at [14] of
                    the 6 April 2011 Oral Judgment) that the construction of the Auto-Gate was
                    within the Respondent’s rights as a landowner so long as she did not
                    render the Appellants’ use of the Easement unreasonably inconvenient. In
                    this regard, the Judge took into account the Respondent’s offer to supply
                    the Appellants with (<em>inter alia</em>) a remote control
                    to operate the Auto-Gate. As for the rest of the prayers in OS 46 and all
                    the prayers in OS 85, the Judge dismissed them, but gave the parties
                    liberty to apply should there be any fresh works affecting the use and enjoyment
                    of their respective properties (see [12] of the 6 April 2011 Oral Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 11 April 2011, the Respondent
                    commenced building the Kerb Wall opposite No 22’s gate. This was
                    completed on 27 April 2011. <em>Pertinently</em>,<em>the Kerb Wall did not encroach on
                        the </em><em>Driveway.</em> The Appellants,
                    however, claimed that they now found it difficult to drive into and exit from
                    No 22 due to an alleged reduction in vehicular “swing space”
                    caused by the erection of the Kerb Wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thereafter, the Appellants filed OS 350
                    on 6 May 2011. They sought the following orders: (a) a mandatory
                    injunction directing the Respondent to forthwith dismantle the Kerb Wall;
                    (b) an injunction to stop the Respondent from building other walls or
                    structures on the Easement Land; (c) a declaration that they (the
                    Appellants) and their visitors were entitled to use the Easement for
                    unobstructed access to No 22; (d) a declaration that the Respondent
                    was not to obstruct their use of the Easement by, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, closing the Auto-Gate, parking vehicles on the Driveway
                    and/or allowing her children to play on the Easement Land; and (e) an
                    injunction restraining the Respondent from carrying out the aforesaid
                        activities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Strangely, before
                    OS 350 was heard, the Appellants filed Summons No 1971 of 2011
                    (“SUM 1971”) on 9 May 2011 for an interim injunction to
                    stop the Respondent from “building or continuing to build the [Kerb
                        Wall]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> even though the Kerb Wall had
                    already been completed by then (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above). The Judge, after hearing the parties’ respective submissions,
                    visited the Easement Land in the presence of counsel. He then dismissed
                    SUM 1971. The Appellants promptly appealed against his decision (via Civil
                    Appeal No 57 of 2011) on 11 May 2011. That appeal was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Thereafter, the Appellants filed Originating
                    Summons No 371 of 2011 on 12 May 2011 for an extension of time to
                    appeal against the Judge’s decision in OS 85. That application was
                    acceded to by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Respondent had, in the meantime, also
                    constructed beside the Auto-Gate the meter box and the pedestrian access gate
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above. Unsurprisingly, these
                    structures were also vigorously objected to by the Appellants, who asserted that
                    they further evidenced the Respondent’s intention to curtail their use of
                    the Easement. Further, the Appellants (as can be seen from the reliefs which
                    they sought in OS 350) objected to the Respondent’s plans to let her
                    children play on the Easement Land and to park cars on the Driveway, saying that
                    this would affect their use of the Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Judge heard OS 350 on 29 August
                    2011 and gave judgment in favour of the Respondent on 12 December 2011 (see
                        <em>Chia Foong Lin and another v Chan Yuen Yee Alexia
                        Eve</em> [2011] SGHC 261 (“<em>Chia Foong
                        Lin</em>”)). We shall now examine in greater detail the
                    Judge’s decisions in OS 350 and OS 85.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decisions below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in OS 85</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As the Judge heard both OS 85 and
                    OS 46 together (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the
                    6 April 2011 Oral Judgment dealt with issues pertaining to both matters.
                    However, as the decision in OS 46 is not being appealed against in either
                    of the present appeals, we shall set out only the Judge’s decision as
                    regards OS 85 here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As alluded to earlier (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the Judge dismissed OS 85 (and
                    also OS 46, save for prayer 6 of OS 46, in respect of which no
                    order was made) “without prejudice to either side making a fresh
                    application should fresh work not presently identified arise which might affect
                    the use and enjoyment of [the] land and property of the respective
                    parties” (see [12]
                    of the 6 April 2011 Oral Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It bears mention again that during the course
                    of the hearing on 31 March 2011, the Respondent’s counsel confirmed
                    that the Respondent had abandoned plans to build a P&amp;A wall (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). As regards the Respondent’s
                    plan to build the Kerb Wall to replace the flower trough which then stood along
                    No 23’s wall, the Judge held that this would not result in any
                    encroachment on any part of the Driveway that was actually in use. Although the
                    Appellants complained that the building of the Kerb Wall would reduce the
                    Driveway “into ‘a tunnel’, and [make] it difficult for
                    driving through” (see [4] of the 6 April 2011 Oral Judgment), the Judge stated
                    (at [9] of the
                    6 April 2011 Oral Judgment) that even if that were indeed the case, it
                    would not be an “unreasonably intolerable” experience. We pause
                    here to add that after our visit to the Easement Land in the presence of
                    counsel, we were satisfied that this particular complaint by the Appellants was
                    entirely without substance: there was simply no “tunnel” effect to
                    speak of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in OS 350</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We turn now to the Judge’s decision in
                    OS 350. The Judge held that the Appellants’ contention that the
                    construction of the Kerb Wall substantially interfered with their use of the
                    Easement (“the Kerb Wall issue”) was <em>res
                        judicata</em> as he had already conclusively dealt with that issue on
                    the merits by dismissing prayer 3 of OS 85, <em>viz</em>, the prayer for an injunction requiring the Respondent to
                    redesign and, if necessary, rebuild (<em>inter alia</em>)
                        “<em>any other structure near the Easement
                        [Land]</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added]. The Judge was of the view that the italicised words just
                    quoted “would certainly extend to the [K]erb [W]all as well” (see
                        <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In relation to the Appellants’
                    contention that the installation of the Auto-Gate substantially interfered with
                    their use of the Easement (“the Auto-Gate issue”), the Judge
                    clarified that he had earlier not made any order on the Respondent’s
                    prayer in OS 46 for a declaration that she was entitled to install the
                    Auto-Gate (<em>viz</em>, prayer 6 of OS 46 (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)) because the Auto-Gate had
                    not been built yet at that time and, thus, any order on this particular prayer
                    would have been premature (see <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at
                    [10]). He went on to express the view (likewise at <em>Chia Foong
                        Lin</em> at [10]) that the Respondent had the right to build the
                    Auto-Gate on her land, provided no substantial interference was caused to the
                    Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. He noted in this regard
                    (at [11] of <em>Chia </em><em>Foong Lin</em>) that:
                    (a) the Respondent had offered to supply the Appellants with their own set
                    of keys to the Auto-Gate, and had also offered to install an intercom system at
                    the Auto-Gate so that visitors to No 22 could communicate with the
                    Appellants or other persons in the property; (b) the Auto-Gate would be
                    closed only at certain times; and (c) there was beside the Auto-Gate a
                    pedestrian access gate which provided pedestrian access at all times to
                    No 22 via the Easement Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Judge also held that the
                    Respondent’s intention to park her cars on the Driveway did not amount to
                    substantial interference with the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
                    Easement (see <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at
                [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In addition, he noted that the playing of the
                    Respondent’s children on the Easement Land would not substantially
                    interfere with the Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement (see
                        <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at [13]). He therefore did not
                    grant the <em>quia timet</em> injunction which the
                    Appellants had sought to prevent the Respondent’s children from playing on
                    the Easement Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Finally, the Judge held that the construction
                    of the meter box next to the Auto-Gate likewise did not substantially interfere
                    with the Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement (see likewise
                        <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at [13]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issues to be determined in the present
                    appeals are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Are the Kerb Wall issue and the
                        Auto-Gate issue <em>res judicata</em>
                        (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Has there been abandonment by the Appellants and/or their
                        predecessors in title of the Easement in respect of any part of the Easement
                        Land (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Has there been substantial interference with the
                        Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement as a result of:
                        (i) the building of the Kerb Wall; (ii) the installation of the
                        Auto-Gate; (iii) the parking of the Respondent’s cars on the
                        Driveway; and (iv) the playing of the Respondent’s children on
                        the Easement Land (“Issue 3”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Issue 1 is a procedural issue, while Issue 2 and Issue 3 are the
                    substantive legal issues which lie at the heart of the present
                appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether the Kerb Wall issue and the Auto-Gate issue are
                res judicata</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We shall first address Issue 1, which the
                    Respondent has raised in relation to CA 151. As mentioned above at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, the Judge held in OS 350 that
                    the Kerb Wall issue was <em>res judicata</em> because it
                    fell within the scope of the words “any other structure near the Easement
                        [Land]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> in prayer 3 of OS 85,
                    which prayer he had already conclusively dealt with on the merits at the joint
                    hearing of OS 85 and OS 46. The Appellants disagree and argue that in
                    relation to the Kerb Wall issue, the Judge’s ruling in OS 85 was not
                    on the merits and was neither final nor conclusive. Further, the Appellants
                    contend, there was no identity of subject matter between OS 85 and
                    OS 350. As regards the Auto-Gate issue, the Appellants likewise submit that
                    it is not <em>res judicata</em> because of the same two
                    factors (<em>viz</em>, the Judge’s ruling on the
                    issue was not on the merits, and there was no identity of subject matter between
                    OS 85 and OS 350). In response, the Respondent argues that <em>res judicata</em> precludes the Appellants from proceeding on
                    the Kerb Wall issue and the Auto-Gate issue as the Judge had already determined
                    at the joint hearing of OS 46 and OS 85 that she was entitled to build
                    both the Kerb Wall and the Auto-Gate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In our view, the issue of <em>res judicata</em> simply does not arise in CA 151. The reliance
                    by the Respondent’s counsel on this issue is misplaced. In relation to the
                    Kerb Wall issue, the Judge rightly observed in <em>Chia Foong
                        Lin</em> at [8] that “[t]he proper forum for the [Appellants]
                    to submit their arguments on the [K]erb [W]all is before the Court of Appeal in
                    CA 103”. The doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>
                    applies to estop a party in a later proceeding from disputing the correctness of
                    a previous decision by <em>the same</em> court on the same
                    point in an earlier proceeding between the same parties. An appeal against such
                    a previous decision to an <em>appellate</em> court plainly
                    does not attract the application of this doctrine. Simply put, while the Kerb
                    Wall issue, which was first addressed in OS 85, was held to be <em>res judicata</em> by the Judge in OS 350, it is not
                        <em>res judicata</em> before this court in relation to
                    an appeal against the Judge’s decision in OS 350. We can therefore
                    determine the substantive question of whether the erection of the Kerb Wall
                    substantially interferes with the Appellants’ reasonable use of the
                    Easement. As regards the Auto-Gate issue, the Judge clearly stated in <em>Chia Foong Lin</em> at [10] that in OS 46, he had not
                    made any order on the Respondent’s prayer for a declaration that she was
                    entitled to install the Auto-Gate. As no order was made, the doctrine of
                        <em>res judicata</em> does not even arise <em>apropos</em> the Auto-Gate issue. In view of this, this court
                    can proceed to address the substantive arguments raised in relation to both the
                    Kerb Wall issue and the Auto-Gate issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether there has been abandonment by the Appellants
                and/or their predecessors in title of the Easement in respect of any part of the
                Easement Land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We turn now to Issue 2, <em>viz</em>, whether the Appellants and/or their predecessors in
                    title have abandoned the Easement in respect of any part of the Easement Land.
                    The consideration of this issue must of course logically precede the
                    consideration of Issue 3, <em>viz</em>, whether there
                    has been substantial interference with the Appellants’ reasonable
                    enjoyment of the Easement. Plainly, where abandonment of part of an easement
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, abandonment by a dominant owner of an easement
                    in respect of part of the easement land – is established, there is no need
                    to consider, as regards that part of the easement land, whether the dominant
                    owner’s reasonable enjoyment of the easement has been or will be
                    substantially interfered with. This is because where unqualified abandonment by
                    a dominant owner of part of an easement is found, the dominant owner loses his
                    right to use the easement over that part of the easement land in respect of
                    which the easement has been abandoned. The consequence of this is that the
                    servient owner can then exercise exclusive rights of ownership over that part of
                    the easement land. The question of substantial interference with the dominant
                    owner’s reasonable enjoyment of the easement thus does not even arise in
                    relation to that part of the easement land. Conversely, where abandonment
                    (whether in part or in full) by a dominant owner of an easement is not
                    established, the easement continues to subsist, with the dominant owner having
                    the right to reasonable use of the easement over the easement land. Only then
                    does the question of substantial interference with the dominant owner’s
                    reasonable enjoyment of the easement become relevant whenever the servient owner
                    seeks to modify the physical extent and/or the use of the easement
                land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The burden of proof vis-à-vis abandonment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Acquiescence in acts inconsistent with the
                    continuance of the right(s) under an easement may raise a presumption that that
                    right (or one or more of those rights) has been abandoned in respect of either
                    the whole or part of the easement land. The legal burden of proving abandonment
                    of an easement, whether in full or in part, is of course on the party who
                    asserts that there has been abandonment (typically, it is the servient owner who
                    makes such an assertion). However, where the servient owner is able to show a
                    long period of non-user of an easement by the dominant owner, the evidential
                    burden shifts to the dominant owner to explain and show that he nonetheless
                    consistently intended to preserve his rights under the easement.
                    Lord Chelmsford LC succinctly summarised the evidential position in
                        <em>Crossley and Sons</em>,<em>Limited v
                        Lightowler</em> (1867) LR 2 Ch App 478 at 482 as
                    follows:</p>

                        dominant owners] commenced business at their works. The authorities upon the
                        subject of abandonment have decided that <em>a mere
                            suspension of the exercise of a right is not sufficient to prove an

                            ceased to use the right of his intention to preserve it.</em></b> The
                        question of abandonment of a right is one of intention, to be decided upon

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the present case, the legal burden of
                    proving partial abandonment of the Easement falls on the Respondent as she
                    alleges that the Appellants and their predecessors in title abandoned the
                    Easement in respect of certain parts of the Easement Land (“the Disputed
                    Areas”) when they irrevocably acquiesced in certain permanent changes to
                    the physical extent and usage of those areas. The Respondent relies on the fact
                    that there has been no objection by the Appellants and their predecessors in
                    title for at least the past 25 years to structures on the Disputed Areas such as
                    the raised kerb with the grass verge at the end of the Easement Land as well as
                    the trees planted on the grass verge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Such acquiescence,
                    the Respondent says, is plainly an unequivocal manifestation of abandonment by
                    the Appellants and their predecessors in title of the Easement in respect of the
                    Disputed Areas. As such, the Respondent submits, the evidential burden of
                    showing that the Easement has not been abandoned <em>vis-à-vis</em> those areas falls on the Appellants. We agree with
                    this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Having addressed the burden of proof <em>vis-à-vis</em> abandonment, we now examine in detail the
                    applicable legal principles for determining whether an easement has in fact been
                    abandoned, be it in full or in part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Abandonment of easements over registered land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The common law doctrine of abandonment
                    continues to apply to easements over registered land (see John Baalman,
                        <em>The Singapore Torrens System: Being a Commentary on the
                        Land Titles Ordinance, 1956 of the State of Singapore</em> (The
                    Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) (“<em>The
                        Singapore Torrens System</em>”) at pp 176–177). In
                    Singapore, there are now two methods which a party can rely on to establish
                    abandonment (whether in full or in part) of an easement. The first is by
                    adopting the procedure set out in s 106 of the LTA and the second, by
                    establishing abandonment at common law curially.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Section 106 of the LTA reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                            evidence of abandonment, give notice to the proprietor of the dominant
                            tenement and, <em>in the absence of objection
                                </em><em>by that proprietor within one month

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Under the procedure prescribed by
                    s 106(2) of the LTA, non-user of an easement for a period exceeding 12
                    years must first be established. While the common law, as we shall see later (at
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> below), does not prescribe a
                    minimum period of non-user for the purposes of establishing abandonment, it
                    seems to us that, as a matter of common sense, in the light of the statutory
                    timeframe, it will be difficult for any claimant to establish abandonment at
                    common law unless a lapse in the use of the easement for more than 12 years is
                    likewise established. That said, we emphasise that non-user is only one element
                    in the spectrum of considerations that the court will have to assess before
                    making a finding of abandonment (see below at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>). We should also add that where an easement appears in the
                    certificates of title of both the dominant tenement and the servient tenement,
                    the court will have regard to the acts of both the present dominant owner and
                    the present servient owner, as well as (where applicable) the acts of their
                    respective predecessors in title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable legal principles on abandonment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Abandonment will not be readily inferred. This
                    sentiment was accurately captured by Buckley LJ in <em>Gotobed v Pridmore and Another</em> (1970) 115 SJ 78
                        (“<em>Gotobed</em>”), where he observed
                    (at 78):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To establish abandonment [of an easement] the conduct of the dominant
                        owner must have been such as to make it clear that he had at the relevant
                        time a firm intention that neither he nor any successor in title should
                        thereafter make use of the easement. …
                        <em>Abandonment was not to be lightly inferred.
                            </em><em>Owners of property did not normally wish
                            to divest themselves of [an easement] unless it was to their advantage,
                            notwithstanding that they might have no present use for it.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is always an objective question whether a
                    dominant owner firmly intends to abandon an easement, be it in full or in part.
                    As noted in <em>Cook v Mayor and Corporation of Bath</em>
                    (1868) LR 6 Eq 177 at 179, whether an act amounts to abandonment or an
                    intention to abandon is a question of fact to be ascertained from the
                    surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     One factor which appears relevant to whether
                    abandonment is established is the nature of the altered features on the easement
                    land, for example, whether the changes to the easement land by way of new
                    structures or obstructions are permanent or temporary. In this regard,
                    abandonment may also be established from changes to the <em>dominant</em> tenement. In <em>Frontfield Investment
                        Holding (Pte) Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 938 and
                        others</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 410 for instance, Judith
                    Prakash J found it significant (at [44]) that permanent structures
                    which could not be readily removed, including a driveway, a swimming pool and
                    other amenities, had been constructed on the dominant tenement in such a way as
                    to block access to the right of way over the easement land. She found
                    abandonment on the facts. Plainly, the permanence of built-up structures or
                    other features on the easement land and/or the dominant tenement is a matter of
                    considerable significance to the court in cases involving alleged abandonment of
                    easements. This has been emphasised in cases like <em>Gotobed</em> (see the commentary on <em>Gotobed</em> in Colin Sara, <em>Boundaries
                        </em><em>and Easements</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    5th Ed, 2011) (“<em>Boundaries and
                        Easements</em>”) at para 17.06).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In most instances where abandonment of an
                    easement is alleged, the party claiming abandonment typically seeks to rely on a
                    period of non-user of the easement as its main plank. However, the length of
                    non-user is only <em>one</em> of the elements from which
                    the dominant owner’s intention to retain or, conversely, abandon his
                    easement may be inferred. At the end of the day, the length of non-user that
                    suffices to establish abandonment depends very much on an assessment of all the
                    surrounding circumstances (see <em>The Queen v Sarah Chorley and
                        Another</em> (1848) 12 QB 515; 116 ER 960 (“<em>Chorley</em>”) at 519; 962). Nevertheless, it can be
                    said, as a general rule of thumb, that the longer the period of non-user, the
                    more readily a finding of abandonment may be made, subject to there being a
                    satisfactory explanation, gleaned from proof of facts or circumstances,
                    negativing any intention on the dominant owner’s part to abandon the
                    easement in question. We should also point out that save in exceptional cases,
                    mere non-user of an easement is <em>not</em> in itself
                    sufficient to establish abandonment of that easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lord Denman CJ rightly pointed out
                    in <em>Chorley</em> that at common law, there is no minimum
                    period of non-user which must be shown in order to establish abandonment.
                    Nevertheless, he also added a note of caution (at 518; 962) that in cases where
                    the evidence of abandonment took the form of “mere acquiescence in the
                    interruption [of the use of the easement]”, it would be prudent for the
                    court not to rely on a period of non-user of less than 20 years. At the same
                    time, he also recognised (at 518–519; 962) that where there was an act
                        <em>clearly</em> evidencing an intention by the
                    dominant owner to abandon his easement, a shorter period of non-user could
                    suffice and “would have the same effect as an express release
                    ‘without any reference to time’” (see Jonathan Gaunt QC
                    &amp; Justice Morgan, <em>Gale on Easements</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Gale on
                        Easements</em>”) at para 12-71, quoting from <em>Chorley</em> at 519; 962). We should point out here that it
                    does not follow that there is a presumption of abandonment after non-user of an
                    easement for 20 years. Also, as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>, it is unlikely that a period of non-user of less than 12
                    years would suffice, except in the plainest of cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As alluded to earlier, save in exceptional
                    cases, mere non-user of an easement is in itself insufficient to amount to
                    abandonment of that easement. This was reiterated by this court in <em>Lian Kok Hong v Lee Choi Kheong and others</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 378 (“<em>Lian Kok Hong</em>”) at
                    [24] (see also <em>Benn v Hardinge</em> (1992)
                    66 P &amp; CR 246). The non-user must instead be taken together
                    with and examined in the light of the surrounding circumstances. For instance,
                    where non-user occurs because the dominant owner does not need to use the
                    easement, or (<em>vis-à-vis</em> an easement in the form of
                    a right of way specifically) because he has a more convenient (or a preferred)
                    mode of access through his own land, the court may incline towards finding
                    abandonment of that easement (see <em>Ward v Ward</em>
                    (1852) 7 Exch 838; 155 ER 1189).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     If the circumstances as a whole clearly
                    indicate the dominant owner’s intention not to resume usage of the
                    easement granted in his favour, then the courts may imply a <em>presumption of release</em> of the easement and the easement will be
                    lost (see <em>Swan v Sinclair</em> [1924] 1 Ch 254
                        (“<em>Swan</em>”) at 266). That said,
                        <em>Gale on Easements</em> states at para 12-66
                    that a presumption of abandonment of an easement will only arise where:
                    (a) the dominant owner acts in a manner clearly indicating a firm intention
                    that neither he nor any of his successors in title should thereafter make use of
                    the easement; or (b) there exist circumstances which are adverse to the use
                    of the easement and which are sufficient to explain the non-user, coupled with a
                    substantial length of time during which the dominant owner has acquiesced in
                    that state of affairs (see, for instance, <em>Swan</em> at
                    267–268). A similar observation was made in <em>Chorley</em>, where it was stated (at 519; 962):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not so much the duration of the cesser as the nature of the act done
                        by the grantee of the easement, <em>or of the adverse act
                            acquiesced in by him, and the intention in him which either the one or
                            the other indicates, which are material for the consideration of the
                            jury</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It can be seen from the above extract that
                    acquiescence by the dominant owner in an adverse act by the servient owner is a
                    relevant consideration in determining if there is abandonment of an easement.
                    For example, it was held in <em>Lian Kok Hong</em> that a
                    long period of acquiescence (about 30 years in that case) in the form of
                    inaction and a lack of objection by the successive owners of the dominant
                    tenement to the fencing off of their right of way over the easement land was
                    sufficient acquiescence on their part to the right of way being rendered
                    unusable. Given these circumstances, this court concluded that the conduct of
                    the successive owners of the dominant tenement amounted to a conscious act of
                    abandonment (see <em>Lian Kok Hong</em> at
                [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In summary then, the general approach to be
                    adopted in scrutinising claims of abandonment of an easement is that concisely
                    stated in <em>Boundaries and Easements</em> at
                    para 17.07, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court will, therefore, look both at any period of non-user and at any
                        acts by the dominant owner or by the servient owner and accepted by the
                        dominant owner. It will then look at the reasons for non-user, the reasons
                        for any actions by the dominant owner and the reasons why the acts of the
                        servient owner have been accepted and decide, looking at all these facts,
                        whether an intention to abandon can be inferred. It is, however, clear that
                        abandonment will not be lightly inferred and that acquiescence in a
                        temporary obstruction may be regarded as good-neighbourliness rather than
                        abandonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Determining whether abandonment of an easement
                    has been established is, at the end of the day, a highly fact-sensitive
                    assessment. It is a question of fact that may be answered inferentially from
                    proven circumstances. Prior decisions are only useful in so far as they
                    establish principles which are generally applicable to similar cases. With the
                    foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to the facts of the present
                    appeals to determine whether the Appellants and their predecessors in title have
                    indeed, as the Respondent contends, abandoned the Easement in respect of the
                    Disputed Areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Appellants argue that they (and, in
                    effect, their predecessors in title) have never abandoned the Easement in
                    respect of the area at the end of the Easement Land where (as mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) there is at present a raised
                    kerb with a grass verge on which the Kerb Wall and three mature trees now stand
                    (“the First Disputed Area”). They contend that they have, from
                    time to time, made use of that grass verge and the airspace above it by walking
                    over the grass verge (the Appellants’ “‘walking’
                    assertion”) and by reversing their vehicles over it (the
                    Appellants’ “‘reversing’ assertion”). The
                    Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Appellants and their predecessors
                    in title abandoned the Easement in relation to the First Disputed Area when they
                    unmistakeably acquiesced for almost 25 years in changes to that area, including
                    (among other things) the construction of the raised kerb.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    According to the Respondent, the building of the raised kerb was approved by the
                    authorities and completed by 1988, and no objections were raised against it at
                    all thereafter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Apart from contending
                    that they have not abandoned the Easement in respect of the First Disputed Area,
                    the Appellants also argue that they (and, in effect, their predecessors in
                    title) have not abandoned the Easement <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the area at the entrance of the Easement Land where there used to be concrete
                    planter boxes and where the meter box mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above now stands (“the Second Disputed
                    Area”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We affirm the Judge’s finding that the
                    Respondent has indeed established a firm intention by the Appellants and their
                    predecessors in title to abandon the Easement in respect of both the First
                    Disputed Area and the Second Disputed Area. We now give our reasons for
                    affirming this finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In relation to the First Disputed Area, we
                    observe that the veracity of the Appellants’ “walking”
                    assertion (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above) appears
                    questionable because the First Disputed Area is in fact situated right along the
                    boundary of No 23 (the Respondent’s house) and is directly <em>opposite</em> No 22 (the Appellants’ property).
                    Given the location of the grass verge in the First Disputed Area, it is unlikely
                    that the Appellants walk along that part of the Easement Land to exit from or
                    enter No 22. Further, we note that the Appellants have not adduced any
                    evidence of prior usage of the grass verge in this manner by their predecessors
                    in title. We infer from this conspicuous omission that such evidence, had it
                    been adduced, would not support the Appellants’ “walking”
                    assertion. Separately, as we shall point out at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> below, the Appellants’ “reversing”
                    assertion is also flatly contradicted by their own evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On her part, the Respondent asserts that her
                    predecessor in title had built in the First Disputed Area, on the right-hand
                    side of the Easement Land, a flower trough and a retaining wall encroaching on
                    the Easement Land.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> As mentioned at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above, the Respondent also points out that
                    the raised kerb in the First Disputed Area was built by 1988 and therefore has
                    been there for “almost 25 years”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> now.
                    Additionally, she states that the three mature trees now present on the grass
                    verge in the First Disputed Area have been growing there “for the last 20
                        years”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> We are satisfied that the
                    Appellants, like their predecessors in title, did not take issue with the
                    presence of the raised kerb and the three mature trees on the grass verge in the
                    First Disputed Area after acquiring and moving into No 22 some nine years
                    ago in 2003. This is not unlike the circumstances which prevailed in <em>Lian Kok Hong</em>, where the successive owners of the
                    dominant tenement knew about the right of way granted in their favour when the
                    dominant tenement was conveyed to them, but thereafter failed to make any
                    protest despite the right of way being obstructed by a fence. The absence of any
                    objection for about 30 years to this state of affairs by the successive owners
                    of the dominant tenement was held, as stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above), to amount to acquiescence which was
                    sufficient to establish their abandonment of their right of way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Also, as rightly pointed out by the
                    Respondent, the raised kerb and the three mature trees on the grass verge in the
                    First Disputed Area are permanent structures that clearly demarcate the area
                    required for the reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. These structures are not
                    readily removable without expending a not insubstantial amount of money and
                    effort. These are all relevant considerations which incline in favour of finding
                    abandonment of the Easement in respect of the First Disputed Area. We note too
                    that the aforesaid structures prevent vehicles and individuals from driving and
                    walking through the First Disputed Area, and are thus factually incompatible
                    with the Appellants’ present belated attempts to insist on their right to
                    use the Easement over the full extent of the Easement Land, including over the
                    First Disputed Area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     To summarise, the long period of acquiescence
                    by the Appellants and their predecessors in title in the physical unavailability
                    (or non-accessibility) of the First Disputed Area for the purposes of using the
                    Easement clearly indicates a firm intention on their part to abandon the
                    Easement in respect of that area. The permanent nature of the raised kerb with
                    the grass verge on which (<em>inter alia</em>) the Kerb
                    Wall now stands and the maturity of the trees on the grass verge have also been
                    important considerations in this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     At the end of the day, the main complaint of
                    the Appellants <em>vis-à-vis</em> the First Disputed Area
                    now appears to be reduced to that of there being (so they allege) insufficient
                    room for them to reverse their cars out of No 22 after the construction of
                    the Kerb Wall. Crucially, we note, however, that the first appellant in
                    CA 103, Wee, has unequivocally and paradoxically affirmed that the
                    Appellants have always driven head-out first from No 22 onto the Easement
                    Land after performing a three-point turn within No 22’s compound. The
                    relevant paragraph in Wee’s affidavit filed on 8 February 2011 states
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have <b><em>always </em></b><em>driven in
                            and out of our compound head-in first</em> in the interest of
                        safety in the past, doing a 3-point turn in our compound. <b><em>We intend to continue with this familiar practice, which has
                            been proven to be a safe practice all these years</em></b>. [emphasis
                        added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     This entirely undermines the Appellants’
                    subsequent assertion that it is their practice to reverse their cars out of
                    No 22 and that they do so often. In the circumstances, we find that the
                    Appellants’ complaint about the erection of the Kerb Wall depriving them
                    of manoeuvring airspace to reverse their cars out of No 22 is implausible
                    and, indeed, appears contrived. We also find that the amount of airspace
                    allegedly lost by the Appellants as a result of the erection of the Kerb Wall is
                        <em>de minimis</em> and, in any event, is unlikely to
                    be the substantial cause of their present alleged difficulties in reversing
                    their cars out of No 22 (see below at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>–<a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We are therefore of the view that the
                    Appellants have failed to displace the evidential burden, placed on them by the
                    prevailing facts, of showing that they and their predecessors in title have not
                    abandoned the Easement in relation to the First Disputed Area. On the contrary,
                    on the basis of the established facts, we are satisfied that the Appellants and
                    their predecessors in title acquiesced in significant changes to the usage and
                    physical extent of the First Disputed Area – that is to say, in the
                    presence there of the raised kerb with the grass verge on which the Kerb Wall
                    and three mature trees now stand – for a long period of time, which
                    changes have rendered the Easement unusable <em>vis-à-vis</em> the First Disputed Area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In relation to the Second Disputed Area, we
                    find that there has likewise been abandonment of the Easement in respect of that
                    area for reasons similar to those set out above in relation to the First
                    Disputed Area. In her affidavit filed on 23 June 2011 in respect of
                    OS 350, the Respondent deposed that concrete planter boxes (which have
                    since been removed following the reconstruction works at No 23) had been in
                    the Second Disputed Area since 1988, and neither vehicles nor individuals could
                    drive or walk through this area. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> In <em>Chia
                        Foong Lin</em> at [13], the Judge accepted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]here were concrete planter boxes where the meter box
                            [<em>ie</em>, the meter box mentioned at [6] above]
                        will be. <em>This meant that that part of the right of way
                            had already been inaccessible to pedestrians and vehicles</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The aforesaid concrete planter boxes were undoubtedly permanent
                    man-made structures built on the Second Disputed Area which were relatively
                    difficult to remove. Their presence constituted a clear adverse circumstance as
                    regards the use of the Easement. However, for a significant period of over 20
                    years, the Appellants and their predecessors in title accepted the presence of
                    these concrete planter boxes. There was therefore a long period of acquiescence
                    in the existence of these structures and, consequently, in the fact that this
                    part of the Easement Land (<em>viz</em>, the Second
                    Disputed Area) was inaccessible. There was no credible contrary evidence that
                    the Appellants and their predecessors in title sought to use this area for
                    passage to and from No 22 as part of their rights under the Easement. As
                    such, we find that the Appellants have not displaced the evidential burden of
                    showing non-abandonment of the Easement on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We now turn to address Issue 3, <em>viz</em>, whether there has been substantial interference
                    with the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement as a result of
                    the four factors outlined at [26(c)] above (namely, the construction of the Kerb
                    Wall, the installation of the Auto-Gate, the parking of the Respondent’s
                    cars on the Driveway and the playing of the Respondent’s children on the
                    Easement Land).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether there has been substantial interference with
                the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Before we examine the facts relevant to
                    Issue 3, we think it will be helpful if we first set out generally the
                    essential characteristics of an easement as well as the incidental rights and
                    obligations of the dominant owner and the servient owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What is the nature of an easement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     An easement is an appurtenant right that one
                    landowner (<em>viz</em>, the dominant owner) has to use
                    land belonging to another (<em>viz</em>, the servient
                    owner) <em>in a certain manner</em>. It is a right to
                        <em>do an act</em> or to <em>prevent an
                        act from occurring</em>, but it is not a right to have something done
                    (see <em>Jones v Price</em> [1965] 2 QB 618 at 631).
                    An easement thus requires no more than sufferance on the part of the servient
                    owner (see <em>Rance v Elvin and Another</em> (1985)
                    50 P &amp; CR 9 at 13). Wrongful interference with the reasonable
                    use of an easement is a nuisance that may be injuncted. Often, the key issue in
                    disputes involving easements is whether the nature of the interference justifies
                    the injuncting of the activities causing the interference. The following
                    illuminating passage from <em>The Singapore Torrens
                        System</em>, authored by John Baalman, the accomplished draftsman of
                    the Land Titles Ordinance 1956 (No 21 of 1956) (the then equivalent of the
                    LTA), has, with remarkable conciseness and penetration, captured the essence of
                    the attributes of an easement (at pp 178–179):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The owner of land who grants an easement does no more
                            than to part with a fraction of his dominion over the servient
                            land.</em> He simply enables the grantee to do that which, without
                        the grant, would have been unlawful; in other words, to commit what
                            o<em>therwise</em> would have been an act of
                        trespass, or of nuisance. <em>The grantor continues to be the
                            owner of the soil, and the only obligation which rests on him is to
                            refrain from doing anything which would substantially interfere with the
                            enjoyment of the easement by the grantee.</em> Thus <em>if the grantor of a right of way wishes to use the way himself
                            he can do so without needing any express provision in the grant, for the
                            simple reason that he is the owner of the soil.</em> And he can
                        allow other persons to use it also, either informally, or by granting them
                        easements. In fact the number of additional licences or easements which a
                        servient owner can create is limited only by the test above mentioned
                        – i.e. whether the additional grants increase the burden on the
                        servient land to an extent (e.g. by congesting traffic on a right of way)
                        which substantially interferes with the rights of the original grantee.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The key points that emerge from this summary
                    are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     First, the servient owner (the grantor of the
                    easement) does <em>not</em> part with ownership and/or all
                    of his ownership rights in relation to the easement land. He merely parts with a
                        <em>fraction</em> of his dominion rights over the
                    easement land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Second, the dominant owner (the grantee of the
                    easement) only acquires a <em>limited interest</em> over
                    the easement land. He is merely permitted to do lawfully what would otherwise be
                    unlawful. The dominant owner acquires no particular right as to how the easement
                    land might be used or dealt with, other than the right to enjoy the reasonable
                    use of the easement granted to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Third, the servient owner may use the easement
                    land as he pleases, provided he does not do anything that would <em>substantially interfere</em> with the reasonable enjoyment of
                    the easement by the dominant owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Fourth, plainly, the dominant owner has no
                    right to insist on maintenance of the <em>status quo</em>
                    if changes to or on the easement land do not substantially interfere with his
                    reasonable enjoyment of the easement. The powerfully evocative terms
                    “dominant” and “servient”, while conceptually
                    coherent, can be factually misleading. <em>The rights of the
                        dominant owner over the easement land do not trump those of the servient
                        owner. The rights of the former are limited to reasonable enjoyment of the
                        easement.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Fifth, the dominant owner has <em>no</em> proprietary interest in the easement land and
                        <em>can only prevent actions that will substantially
                        interfere with his reasonable enjoyment of the easement.</em> The
                    operative test is not that of any interference with the reasonable enjoyment of
                    the easement, but rather, that of <em>substantial
                        interference.</em> It follows that the servient owner has <em>an absolute right</em> to improve and/or use the easement
                    land for his own benefit if this does not cause substantial interference with
                    the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment of the easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We shall further explicate these points below
                    at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>–<a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law on substantial interference with the reasonable
                use of an easement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Often, when disputes involving easements
                    arise, the focus is usually on the dominant owner and his rights. However, as
                    mentioned earlier, this is only part of the “<em>sharing
                        equation</em>” between the dominant owner and the servient
                    owner (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). The rights of the dominant owner must
                    be balanced against those of the servient owner in relation to the easement
                    land, which (being part of the servient tenement) belongs to the servient owner.
                    The servient owner has rights of ownership, possession and usage over the
                    easement land, and the existence of an easement over the easement land does not
                    confer any right on the dominant owner (the grantee of the easement) to prevent
                    the servient owner from using the easement land in any way which is not
                    significantly inconsistent with the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment
                    of the easement. <em>As the owner of the easement land, the
                        servient owner can exercise all incidents of ownership over that land
                        </em><em>as well as make practical use of it, subject
                        only to the restriction that </em><em>he cannot
                        substantially interfere with the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment
                        of the easement.</em> Therefore, in disputes over easement usage, the
                    court has to strike an appropriate balance between allowing the servient owner
                    practical usage of the easement land and ensuring that the dominant
                    owner’s right to reasonable enjoyment of the easement is not substantially
                    interfered with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is only where there is interference of a
                    substantial nature with the dominant owner’s reasonable use of the
                    easement that a claim for relief in nuisance will succeed. The test, in essence,
                    is that of “‘substantial interference’ with the [easement]
                    … in a form which is plainly obstructive of its reasonable use”
                    (see Kevin Gray &amp; Susan Francis Gray, <em>Elements of Land
                        Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Gray &amp; Gray</em>”) at
                    para 5.1.87). This test has also been affirmed by this court in <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title
                        Plan No 301</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 875.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The “substantial interference”
                    test has been described in <em>B&amp;Q Plc v Liverpool and
                        Lancashire Properties Limited</em> (2000) 81 P &amp; CR
                    246 (“<em>B&amp;Q</em>”) at [48]–[49]
                    as turning on convenience, <em>ie</em>, whether the
                    interference with the easement land renders the continuance of the dominant
                    owner’s reasonable use of the easement “<em>materially less convenient than before</em>” [emphasis added]
                    (at [71]). The dominant
                    owner “can only object to such activities, including obstruction, as
                        <em>substantially interfere</em> with the exercise of
                    the defined right <em>as for the time being is reasonably
                        required by him</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>per</em> Mummery LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>West v Sharp</em> [2000]
                    79 P &amp; CR 327 at 332). In substance, this test requires the
                    court to assess whether the interference with or the obstructions present on the
                    easement land disturb the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment of the
                    easement in a materially significant way. This, of course, depends on the nature
                    of the easement and what it is used for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Private rights of way</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In relation to easements in the form of
                    private rights of way specifically, John Leybourn Goddard, <em>A
                        Treatise on The Law of Easements</em> (Stevens and Sons Limited,
                    8th Ed, 1921) (“<em>Goddard</em>”)
                    authoritatively summarised the position almost a hundred years ago thus (at
                    p 389):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[A] </em><em>right of way along a
                            private road belonging to another person does not generally give the
                            dominant owner a right that the road shall in no respect be altered, or
                            the width decreased; for </em><em>his right does
                            not entitle him to the use of the whole of the road, unless the whole
                            width of the road is necessary for his purpose – and it is merely
                            a right to pass with the convenience to which he has been
                            accustomed</em>; the right, therefore, merely extends to that
                        portion of the centre of the road which is necessary for the due exercise of
                        the right of passage; and the only obligation upon the servient owner is,
                        that he shall not unreasonably contract the width of the road, or render the
                        exercise of the right of passing substantially less easy than it was at the
                        time of the grant. This general rule may of course be altered by
                        circumstances, as was the case in <em>Nicol</em> v.
                            <em>Beaumont</em> [(1883) 53 LJ Ch 853;
                        50 LT 112], in which there was a grant of right to pass “in the
                        same manner and as fully as if the same were public roads”. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     
          <em>Gray &amp; Gray</em>
                    reiterates this view in the modern context. It rightly observes (at
                    para 5.1.87):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unlike the case of the public highway (where any ‘appreciable’
                        obstruction is wrongful), <em>not every form of interference
                            with a private right of way is actionable</em>. <em>The courts are increasingly anxious to uphold an ethic of
                            ‘reasonableness between neighbours’ and frequently endorse
                            the idea that in the law of nuisance there must be a large element of
                            ‘give and take’. </em><b><em>A right of
                            way cannot, by definition, confer rights of exclusive user. It
                            necessarily follows that the threshold of actionable nuisance is reached
                            only when there is ‘substantial’ interference with the way
                            as granted in a form which is plainly obstructive of its reasonable
                            use</em></b>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In this regard, <em>Goddard</em>’s reference (at p 389) to the usage of
                    “the whole width of the [easement land]” is instructive. The court
                    will have to assess usage pragmatically and apply as its touchstone the test of
                    reasonableness. Plainly, the court will not readily frown upon every alleged
                    interference by the servient owner with a private right of way. The alleged
                    interference must be material and plainly obstructive, and thereby constitute a
                    substantial interference with the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment of
                    the right of way. Careful consideration will, in particular, be accorded to the
                        <em>reasonableness</em> of the conduct of both the
                    dominant owner and the servient owner. This approach is also affirmed in
                        <em>Gale on Easements</em> as follows (at
                    para 13-06):</p>

<em>. Again, it has been said that
                            for the obstruction of a private way the dominant owner cannot complain

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It should also be noted that an ordinary right

                    owner the right to park on the easement land, or even to turn or reverse his
                    vehicles on it. Such rights are not always necessary to the effective reasonable
                    enjoyment of a right of way (see <em>Richard Frank Horton

                    at [34]–[35]). We note also the observations made by the High Court in
                        <em>Lim Hong Seng v East Coast Medicare Centre Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 680 at [44], where it was stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he express easement enjoyed by the plaintiff would not, even
                        if … construed … as a general right of way, have allowed him
                        to park his car on the driveway. The easement was for access not
                        storage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The structures and activities complained of</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the light of our finding (at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above) that there has been abandonment by the
                    Appellants and their predecessors in title of the Easement in respect of
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) the First Disputed Area
                        (<em>ie</em>, the area at the end of the Easement Land
                    where there is a raised kerb with a grass verge on which the Kerb Wall and three
                    mature trees now stand), it is, strictly speaking, not necessary for us to
                    address the issue of whether the erection of the Kerb Wall has caused
                    substantial interference with the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
                    Easement. The First Disputed Area is now <em>not</em>
                    subject to any easement and, thus, the Respondent, as the owner of that area
                    (along with the rest of the plot of land on which No 23 stands), had an
                    absolute right to build the Kerb Wall on her land. For completeness, however, we
                    shall nonetheless consider the Appellants’ complaint that the Kerb Wall
                    substantially interferes with their reasonable use of the
                Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We should also point out that even though we
                    have found that the Appellants and their predecessors in title have abandoned
                    the Easement in respect of the Second Disputed Area as well, we still need to
                    consider the Appellants’ allegation of substantial interference with their
                    reasonable enjoyment of the Easement arising from the installation of the
                    Auto-Gate, the parking of the Respondent’s cars on the Driveway and the
                    playing of the Respondent’s children on the Easement Land (<em>cf</em> what we have just said at [73] above <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Appellants’ complaint about the Kerb Wall).
                    This is because these factors relate to parts of the Easement Land which are
                    outside both of the Disputed Areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Kerb Wall</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It became apparent to us, after analysing the
                    Appellants’ complaints, that the effect of the Kerb Wall on the
                    Appellants’ ability to execute three-point turns to exit from No 22
                    is effectively the remaining real bone of contention between the parties where
                    the Kerb Wall is concerned. The Appellants assert that the Kerb Wall encroaches
                    on the airspace above the First Disputed Area, thus depriving them of vehicular
                    “swing room” when they reverse their cars out of No 22. As a
                    result, they claim that they are now required to execute intricate driving
                    manoeuvres to avoid hitting the Kerb Wall whenever they reverse their cars out
                    of No 22. They also state that the Kerb Wall creates a safety hazard
                    because drivers may now decide to reverse their vehicles down the entire length
                    of the Driveway in order to reach the public road at Oei Tiong Ham Park. They
                    add, for good measure, that due to the difficulties presented by the Kerb
                    Wall’s presence, they are now restricted in the choice and the number of
                    cars which they can purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In response, the Respondent argues that the
                    Kerb Wall does not encroach on the Easement Land at all. She maintains that
                    three-point turns at the end of the Easement Land can still be made, and that
                    there has been no substantial interference with the Appellants’ reasonable
                    use of the Easement. She disagrees that the Appellants frequently reverse their
                    cars out of No 22 and thus need turning space at the end of the Easement
                    Land for this purpose. To drive home her point, the Respondent has adduced
                    up-to-date photographs to illustrate how the Appellants ordinarily drive out
                    from No 22. She insists that any difficulties which the Appellants may have
                    in reversing their cars out of No 22 are solely attributable to the altered
                    position of No 22’s gate. In short, the Respondent claims that the
                    Appellants are the authors of their own alleged predicament, assuming it
                    exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     We find that the erection of the Kerb Wall on
                    its own has not substantially interfered with the Appellants’ reasonable
                    enjoyment of the Easement. In any event, the ability to reverse their cars at
                    the end of the Easement Land is not reasonably required by the Appellants. The
                    following are our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     First, it is relevant that the size of the
                    Driveway on the Easement Land has not been decreased in any way. This is
                    pertinent, given that the Easement consists of a right of way. <em>That the physical dimensions of the Driveway have remained
                        effectively the same before and after the reconstruction works at No 23
                        is indicative that there has </em><em>been little or,
                        at most, only </em><em>minor interference with the
                        Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement since the Kerb Wall was
                        constructed.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Second, the essence of the Appellants’
                    complaint <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Kerb Wall is their loss of
                    turning space when reversing their cars out of No 22. We find this
                    complaint unmeritorious. It appears that prior to the construction of the Kerb
                    Wall, the horizontal distance over the grass verge at the end of the Easement
                    Land which the Appellants could in reality actually have enjoyed when reversing
                    their cars out of No 22 could only have amounted to 280mm at most. This is
                    the distance from the Kerb Wall to the trunk of the innermost tree at the end of
                    the Easement Land, with the thickness of the Kerb Wall included.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> We also note that
                    that tree slants <em>towards</em> the Driveway, effectively
                    reducing the amount of space which could have been used for reversing even
                    before the erection of the Kerb Wall. We therefore agree with the Respondent
                    that the horizontal distance lost as a result of the building of the Kerb Wall
                    is <em>de minimis</em> at best. The resultant diminution in
                    turning radius thus does not amount to a substantial interference with the
                    Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. In any case, even if the
                    Appellants are now required, when driving out of No 22, to make a few more
                    turns instead of the typical three-point ones, we are of the view that this does
                    not meet the requisite threshold of <em>substantial</em>
                    interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. As mentioned at
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>, <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> and <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> above, not all inconveniences which interfere
                    with the reasonable use of an easement are legally actionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Third, it has been established that the usual
                    practice of the Appellants has all along been to drive out of No 22
                    head-out first (see above at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>).
                    Ordinarily, the user of an easement (<em>ie</em>, the
                    dominant owner) ought not to be deprived of his preferred <em>modus operandi</em> of using the easement (see <em>B&amp;Q</em> at [40]–[45]). Here, the preferred <em>modus operandi</em> of the Appellants in exiting from
                    No 22 is that of driving head-out first, and that mode of using the
                    Easement has clearly not been restricted by the erection of the Kerb
                    Wall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Fourth, it appears to us likely that the
                    shifting of No 22’s gate along the Driveway towards the end of the
                    Easement Land has contributed significantly to the Appellants’ present
                    alleged difficulties in reversing their cars out of No 22, over and above
                    the small degree of interference caused by the erection of the Kerb Wall as
                    noted earlier. While the parties disagree on the precise extent of the shift
                    (the Appellants state the figure as 70cm while the Respondent states it as 100cm
                    (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)), it cannot be gainsaid that
                    the necessary consequence of the shift, whether by 70cm or 100cm, is an
                    appreciable reduction in the amount of manoeuvring space available for the
                    Appellants’ cars to execute turns on the Easement Land immediately upon
                    exiting from No 22. We therefore find that the erection of the Kerb Wall
                    cannot possibly have been the primary cause of this alleged
                    inconvenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Fifth, the Appellants have no absolute right
                    to use the Easement Land for particular manoeuvres such as reversing because the
                    Easement consists of a right of way (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above), <em>ie</em>, a right of
                        <em>passage</em> through the Easement Land for access
                    to and from No 22. Besides, the evidence shows that there was previously no
                    need for such manoeuvres before No 22’s gate was
                shifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The Auto-Gate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     We now turn to the Appellants’
                    complaints about the Auto-Gate. The Appellants allege that the Auto-Gate
                    substantially interferes with their reasonable enjoyment of the Easement.
                    Specifically, they say that if the Auto-Gate were to be closed, they will be
                    adversely affected in the following ways: (a) they will lose the unimpeded
                    access to and from the Easement Land which they currently enjoy when the
                    Auto-Gate is not closed; (b) postmen and visitors to No 22 will be
                    unaware of the presence of No 22; and (c) they (<em>ie</em>, the Appellants) will be impeded in the discharge of their
                    professional obligations as medical doctors when they are required to attend to
                    medical emergencies. They add that providing them with a remote control for the
                    Auto-Gate and installing an intercom system there will not mitigate the loss
                    (when the Auto-Gate is closed) of their right to unimpeded access to and from
                    the Easement Land. The Respondent argues, on the other hand, that the
                    installation of the Auto-Gate has not substantially interfered with the
                    Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement. She affirms that she had
                    previously offered to provide the Appellants with a remote control and a set of
                    manual keys for the Auto-Gate, as well as to install at the Auto-Gate at her own
                    expense an intercom system linked to No 22. In addition, she had previously
                    offered to incorporate an open pedestrian access route leading to the Easement
                    Land, provide a post box for No 22 as well as display No 22’s
                    unit number on the pillar of the Auto-Gate in order to quell the
                    Appellants’ worries about the lack of visibility of No 22 should the
                    Auto-Gate be closed. The Respondent has also informed us that the Auto-Gate will
                    be closed only when her children play on the Easement Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The legal position in respect of gates and
                    barriers which are alleged to interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of an
                    easement coheres with the general position stated above (at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the respective
                    rights of a servient owner and a dominant owner. Simply put, the servient owner,
                    in exercise of his rights of ownership, is entitled to fence up the easement
                    land. However, his entitlement is circumscribed by his obligation not to
                    substantially interfere with the dominant owner’s reasonable enjoyment of
                    the easement (see <em>Gale on Easements</em> at
                    para 13-14). <em>Gray &amp; Gray</em> rightly states
                    (at para 5.1.89, citing <em>Sunset Properties Pty Ltd v
                        Johnston</em> (1975) 3 BPR 9185 at 9195) that the true test in
                    respect of interference arising from the erection of gates and barriers is
                    “whether the gate is ‘locked against
                    enjoyment’”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We agree with the Judge that the installation
                    and the closure of the Auto-Gate will not amount to substantial interference
                    with the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. Our reasons are
                    as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     First, it is pertinent to note that there has
                    always been a gate at the entrance of the Easement Land, although the previous
                    gate was a manual one. This undermines the Appellants’ present stance in
                    respect of the Auto-Gate. That the existence of the previous manual gate was
                    never objected to by the Appellants and their predecessors in title evinces an
                    implicit acceptance on their part that any gate at the entrance of the Easement
                    Land can be closed as and when required. Otherwise, why have a gate at all?
                    Further, as we have just mentioned (see <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>
                    above), a servient owner does in law have a right to fence up the easement land,
                    provided no substantial interference with the dominant owner’s reasonable
                    use of the easement is caused. Where an easement takes the form of a right of
                    way, the locking of a gate leading to the right of way is not in itself
                    inconsistent with the reasonable enjoyment of the easement, especially if the
                    dominant owner is provided with a key or a combination lock code for the gate
                    (see <em>Gray &amp; Gray</em> at para 5.1.89). Given
                    that the Respondent has offered to provide the Appellants with a similar level
                    of access in the present case (see <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>
                    above), the installation of the Auto-Gate does not substantially interfere with
                    the Appellants’ right to reasonable enjoyment of the
                Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Second, the Auto-Gate, being
                    remote-controlled, would appear to be easier and more convenient for the
                    Appellants to operate as compared to the previous manual one. Previously,
                    whenever the manual gate happened to be closed, the Appellants would have had to
                    walk over to the gate to manually push it open. The Appellants’ argument
                    that the Auto-Gate may malfunction too frequently and thus prevent easy access
                    from the Easement Land to the public road at Oei Tiong Ham Park and <em>vice versa</em> is a strained one, especially given that the
                    Appellants too have installed an automatic remote-controlled gate for
                    No 22.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Third, the Respondent has offered to display
                    No 22’s unit number on the pillar of the Auto-Gate, erect a post box
                    for No 22 at the Auto-Gate and provide at the Auto-Gate at her own expense
                    an intercom system linked to No 22. She has also stated that she intends to
                    leave unlocked the pedestrian access gate beside the Auto-Gate so as to
                    facilitate third-party access (for instance, by postmen or visitors) to
                    No 22 via the Easement Land. With these facilities offered to the
                    Appellants to facilitate third-party access, we find it difficult to understand
                    their complaints about the Auto-Gate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Pertinently, the Respondent does not intend to
                    close the Auto-Gate unless her children are playing on the Easement Land. As
                    such, the Appellants are perhaps unnecessarily exercised about the closure of
                    the Auto-Gate.</p>

                Driveway</p>

          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    parking of the Respondent’s cars on the Driveway, the Appellants claim
                    that the Respondent’s plans to create permanent car park lots on the
                    Driveway to park her cars for extended periods of time would substantially
                    interfere with their reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. They also cite
                    concerns about contacting the Respondent to shift her car(s) whenever required,
                    and about having to take additional care when driving past other vehicles parked
                    on the Driveway. The Respondent, on the other hand, states that she does not
                    have any plans to create permanent parking spaces on the Driveway, and that any
                    difficulties cited by the Appellants about driving through the Driveway when
                    other vehicles are parked on it have been dramatically overstated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     We agree with the Judge’s finding of
                    fact (at [12] of <em>Chia </em><em>Foong Lin</em>) that there
                    will be no substantial interference with the Appellants’ reasonable
                    enjoyment of the Easement if there is limited parking usage of the Driveway by
                    the Respondent. The Respondent is entitled to reasonable practical usage of her
                    land. Essentially, the question is whether her intended usage in terms of
                    parking her cars on the Driveway is excessive and thereby substantially
                    interferes with the Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the
                    Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Here, the issue of exclusion does not arise as
                    there is no assertion by the Respondent that she is entitled to create permanent
                    parking lots on the Driveway to park her cars. In assessing the right balance to
                    be struck between the parties’ respective rights, we do not think there is
                    any substance in the Appellants’ complaint about the parking of the
                    Respondent’s cars on the Driveway. In any event, a significant
                    consideration in assessing the merits of this complaint is that (as mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) there is ample space on the
                    Driveway for two ordinary domestic vehicles to comfortably pass alongside each
                    other. For the avoidance of doubt, we point out that the Respondent’s
                    right to park her cars on the Driveway, be it at the end of the Easement Land or
                    at the entrance of the Easement Land, must be exercised reasonably, and should
                    not be exercised in such a way as to obstruct at any time the passage of
                    vehicles to and from No 22. Subject to this condition, the
                    Respondent’s right to park her cars on the Driveway includes the right to
                    allow visitors to No 23 to park their cars on the Driveway. This right does
                    not, however, extend to overnight parking on the Driveway of the
                    Respondent’s cars or the cars of visitors to No 23, unless the
                    Respondent is unable to park her cars, or to allow visitors to No 23 to
                    park their cars, in No 23’s compound due to extenuating circumstances
                        (<em>eg</em>, if renovation or construction works are
                    being carried out to those areas in No 23’s compound which are
                    normally used for parking, or if the Respondent has several house guests with
                    cars staying overnight at No 23). Should such circumstances arise, the
                    Respondent must give adequate prior notice to the Appellants of her intention to
                    park her cars (or to allow visitors to No 23 to park their cars) on the
                    Driveway overnight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   The playing of the Respondent’s children on the
                Easement Land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The fourth and last factor raised by the
                    Appellants <em>vis-à-vis</em> their allegation of
                    substantial interference with their reasonable use of the Easement relates to
                    the playing of the Respondent’s children on the Easement Land. The
                    Appellants complain that this substantially interferes with their reasonable
                    enjoyment of the Easement. They claim that the Respondent intends to convert the
                    Easement Land into a playground, and that this will pose a safety hazard
                    whenever they need to drive through or reverse their cars out of No 22 onto
                    the Easement Land. In response, the Respondent states that she has no plans to
                    create a children’s playground on the Easement Land and only intends to
                    allow her children to play there from time to time. She also says that there
                    will be no safety hazard posed by her children playing on the Easement Land as
                    her children will simply step to the side whenever any vehicles drive
                    through.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     We are unable to find sufficient merit in this
                    complaint that will justify injuncting the Respondent’s children from
                    playing on the Easement Land. There is no evidence to suggest that the
                    Respondent is planning to construct permanent play facilities there. Also, as
                    noted above (at <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>), the
                    Respondent’s children will play on the Easement Land only from time to
                    time. This cannot be said to substantially interfere with the Appellants’
                    reasonable enjoyment of the Easement. Granted, there will be a need for the
                    Appellants (and visitors driving to No 22) to drive more carefully (or even
                    more slowly) along the Easement Land whenever the Respondent’s children
                    play there, but this cannot be regarded as a substantial interference with the
                    reasonable use of the Easement, given especially that the right of way under the
                    Easement is a <em>private</em> right of way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Non-derogation from grant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As an additional string to their legal bow,
                    the Appellants also argue that the erection of the Kerb Wall, the construction
                    of the meter box and the pedestrian access gate next to the Auto-Gate, the
                    parking of the Respondent’s cars on the Driveway and the playing of the
                    Respondent’s children on the Easement Land effectively result in a
                    derogation from the Easement granted to them. In response, the Respondent argues
                    that these structures and activities on the Easement Land do not result in a
                    derogation from grant as the Easement remains fit to be used for the purposes
                    for which it was granted. The Respondent also contends that a mere reduction in
                    the dimensions of the Easement Land does not substantially interfere with the
                    Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The test of whether there is derogation from
                    the grant of an easement is likewise that of whether there is substantial
                    interference with the dominant owner’s reasonable use of the easement (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>). This was emphasised by the
                    High Court in <em>Cold Storage Singapore (1983) Pte Ltd v
                        Management Corporation of Chancery Court and others</em> [1989]
                    2 SLR(R) 180 and reiterated by this court in <em>Cold
                        Storage Singapore (1983) Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Chancery Court
                        and others</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 992 at [4]–[6]. Simply put,
                    in order to establish derogation from grant, it is insufficient that some
                    interference with the dominant owner’s reasonable use of the easement
                    exists or is threatened; rather, it is crucial that the alleged interference is
                    significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In the present case, the Appellants’
                    allegation of derogation from grant is no more than a mirror image of their
                    contention that their reasonable enjoyment of the Easement has been
                    substantially interfered with. Indeed, the Appellants are relying on similar
                    arguments for both of these complaints. For the reasons stated above at
                        <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>–<a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>, we find that none of the structures and activities
                    complained of can be said to cause substantial interference with the
                    Appellants’ reasonable use of the Easement. Therefore, there is no
                    derogation from the grant of that easement. The Easement Land, as it presently
                    stands, can still be used effectively as a passageway for both vehicular and
                    pedestrian access to and from No 22. In other words, the Easement has not
                    been rendered materially less fit to be used for the purposes for which it was
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Concluding remarks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is plain that the Appellants have
                    fundamentally misapprehended their fractional rights in relation to the Easement
                    Land. They are not and have never been the co-owners of that land. While they
                    are the owners of the dominant tenement (<em>viz</em>,
                    No 22), they are not entitled to assert their fractional rights over the
                    Easement Land in so domineering a manner as to prevent the Respondent from
                    making reasonable use of that part of her land (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). They
                    are therefore not entitled to unreasonably object to each and every change in
                    the Respondent’s usage of the Easement Land (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>, <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> and <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). They also have no absolute right to
                    doggedly insist that every existing aspect or feature of the Easement Land be
                    immutably preserved for posterity (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>
                    above), especially when they and their predecessors in title have already
                    abandoned the Easement in relation to the Disputed Areas (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above). All that the Appellants had prior to
                    the reconstruction works at No 23 and all that they currently have now that
                    those works have been completed is an enforceable right to ensure that the
                    Respondent does not <em>substantially interfere</em> with
                    their right to <em>reasonable</em> use of the Easement Land
                    for entry to and exit from No 22 at any time (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). In
                    this regard, we have found that none of the structures and activities complained
                    of in these proceedings cause substantial interference with the
                    Appellants’ reasonable enjoyment of the Easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In the result, both CA 103 and
                    CA 151 are dismissed with costs, save that in relation to CA 151, the
                    Appellants are entitled to the costs incurred in relation to the getting-up work
                    done on Issue 1, which the Respondent has raised unsuccessfully before this
                    court (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above). The usual
                    consequential orders are to apply for both appeals.</p>
