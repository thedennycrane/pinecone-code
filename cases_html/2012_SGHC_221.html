<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The judgment on the judicial review application
                    in Originating Summons No 196 of 2012 (“OS 196”) (“the
                    Substantive Application”) and the Applicant’s reserved application
                    for two declarations (“the Reserved Application”) was released on
                    1 August 2012: <em>Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2012] SGHC 155 (“the Final
                    Judgment”). At the initial hearing for leave to proceed with the judicial
                    review application (“the Leave Application”), neither counsel made
                    any submissions on costs and none were then ordered. After the Final Judgment
                    was delivered, both counsel made their submissions on the costs of all the above
                    applications. The following is my judgment on the costs of all these
                    applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 28 February 2012 the Speaker of Parliament
                    announced that the elected Member of Parliament seat in Hougang Single Member
                    Constituency (“Hougang SMC”) had become vacant under Art 46(2) of
                    the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint)
                    (“the Constitution”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 2 March 2012 the Applicant filed OS 196
                    seeking a Mandatory Order and two declarations under O 53 r 1(1) of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). The Mandatory
                    Order sought was to enjoin the Prime Minister to advise the President to issue a
                    writ of election for a by-election in Hougang SMC pursuant to Art 49(1) of the
                    Constitution and to tender such advice within three months or within such
                    reasonable time as the court deemed fit. The declarations were to declare that
                    the Prime Minister does not have unfettered discretion in deciding whether to
                    announce a by-election in Hougang SMC and that he must decide within three
                    months or within such reasonable time as the court deemed fit. The Applicant
                    filed her Statement pursuant to O 53 r 1(2) on 4 March 2012 (“the
                    Statement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 9 March 2012, the Prime Minister announced in
                    Parliament that he intended to call a by-election in Hougang SMC but that he had
                    not decided on the timing. He would decide on the timing after taking into
                    account all relevant factors including local, national and international
                    factors: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (9 March 2012) vol 88 at col 5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 3 April 2012, leave was granted to the
                    Applicant to proceed with the Substantive Application. The grounds of decision
                    to grant leave were set out in <em>Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2012] 2 SLR 1033 (“the Leave
                    Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 9 May 2012, the writ of election calling for
                    a by-election in Hougang SMC was issued by the President, upon the advice of the
                    Prime Minister. The by-election was held on 26 May 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After leave was granted, the Attorney-General
                    (“AG”) appealed to the Court of Appeal on 4 April 2012
                    against the decision to grant leave. Following the issue of the writ of election
                    on 16 May 2012, the AG withdrew the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 29 May 2012, the Applicant proceeded with the
                    Substantive Application by filing Summons No 2639 of 2012 (“SUM
                    2639”). This was followed by a series of interlocutory applications
                    (“the Interlocutory Applications”) by both parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Summons No 2684 of 2012 (“SUM
                        2684”) filed by the AG on 31 May 2012, to strike out SUM 2639 and
                        seek a permanent stay on the Leave Application which had been
                        granted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Summons
                        No 2711 of 2012 (“SUM 2711”) filed by the Applicant on 1 June
                        2012 to subpoena and cross-examine the Prime Minister and to obtain
                        discovery of the AG’s advice to the Prime Minister;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Summons No 3296 of 2012 (“SUM
                        3296”) filed by the Applicant on 2 July 2012 to amend SUM 2639;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Summons No
                        3297 of 2012 (“SUM 3297”) filed by the Applicant on 2 July
                        2012 to amend the Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 5 July 2012, the four summonses above were
                    heard. The AG’s SUM 2684 was dismissed. The Applicant’s SUM 2711 and
                    SUM 3296 were dismissed. Leave was granted for the Applicant to withdraw her SUM
                    3297.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Substantive Application and Reserved
                    Application were heard in open court on 16 July 2012. At the hearing, the
                    Applicant abandoned her application for the Mandatory Order. Thus, the relief
                    sought for the Substantive Application was confined to the O 53 declarations.
                    The court determined that it had no power under O 53 to grant standalone
                    declarations where the principal application for a Mandatory Order which
                    included the declarations failed. The court therefore held that the application
                    for the declarations as part of an O 53 judicial review application failed: see
                    the Final Judgment at [31]–[35].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As the Reserved Application did not require
                    the leave of court to proceed, in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings,
                    both parties were heard on the merits of the Reserved Application. The Reserved
                    Application was also dismissed on the principal ground that the Constitution
                    does not require the Prime Minister to call a by-election and that it was within
                    his discretion whether, and if so, when to call a by-election. Costs were to be
                    determined at a later date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ proposals and submissions on costs</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs for the four summonses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Both counsel were heard on costs on 16 October
                    2012. Both counsel took the position that there should be no order as to costs
                    for the Interlocutory Applications, namely SUM 2684, SUM 2711, SUM 3296 and SUM
                    3297.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs for the Leave Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The AG’s counsel submitted that the
                    costs for the Leave Application should now be determined to be costs in the
                    cause. He further submitted that as the ultimately successful party the AG
                    should be awarded total costs of $10,000 (inclusive of
                disbursements).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Applicant’s counsel submitted that
                    as the Applicant had been successful in the Leave Application, she should now be
                    awarded costs for that application. In the light of this, he proposed that the
                    AG’s costs as the ultimately successful party be set off against the
                    Applicant’s costs for her successful Leave Application. He further
                    proposed that these respective costs be taxed and any resulting difference be
                    payable to the party awarded the higher costs. The AG’s counsel rejected
                    his proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At this juncture, it is apposite to note that
                    whilst O 53 r 1(4) anticipates costs orders at the leave stage, neither counsel
                    had raised or made any submissions for costs and accordingly no costs order was
                    made for the Leave Application at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I am unable to accept the AG’s
                    counsel’s submission that costs in the cause should now be ordered for the
                    Leave Application. Before costs in the cause can be ordered, the outcome of the
                    cause must necessarily be unknown. I am also unable to accept the
                    Applicant’s counsel’s submission that costs should now be awarded to
                    the Applicant for her successful Leave Application. Once leave was granted and
                    before the Final Judgment was released, it was open to the Applicant’s
                    counsel to ask either for costs, costs in any event, costs in the cause
                        <em>etc</em>. However, that was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     An impartial and fair determination of costs
                    for the Leave Application is to be made in consideration of all the submissions
                    of counsel and based on the circumstances prevailing at that material time. This
                    cannot be safely made now because of the overhang of the now known Final
                    Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For the above reasons, I decline to now make
                    any orders on costs for the Leave Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs for the Substantive Application and the Reserved
                Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I next proceed to consider both
                    counsel’s submissions in relation to the costs for the Substantive
                    Application and the Reserved Application. Both counsel did not make any
                    submissions that the costs of the Substantive Application should be determined
                    separately from the costs of the Reserved Application. Both counsel appeared
                    content to treat both applications as one for the purposes of costs and I shall
                    proceed to determine the costs on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The AG’s counsel raised three arguments.
                    First, he submitted that the general rule enshrined in O 59 r 3(1) that
                    “costs to follow the event” should apply. Second, he submitted
                    that the general rule had not been displaced by any unreasonable conduct on the
                    part of the successful party. Third, he submitted that even if there was a
                    public interest consideration in the common law in other jurisdictions, this
                    dimension did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Applicant’s counsel did not dispute
                    that the general rule was that costs followed the event. He relied on public
                    interest as a ground for departing from the general rule, citing the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Top Ten
                        Entertainment Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1279 (“<em>Top Ten</em>”) where it was held (at [15]) that, as a
                    starting point, no costs would be ordered against a regulator performing a
                    public duty in the public interest (the “<em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle”). The Applicant’s
                    counsel submitted that the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em>
                    principle should be extended by analogy to the Applicant, who as a private
                    citizen was carrying out her public duty in requesting the court to determine an
                    important constitutional issue concerning parliamentary
                representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I do not accept the stretched analogy used by
                    the Applicant’s counsel. There is neither principle nor authority to
                    support the submission by the Applicant’s counsel that the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle ought to be extended in the
                    manner proposed to include private citizens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Applicant’s counsel finally
                    submitted that, in any event, this was an appropriate case for no order as to
                    costs because the applications involved sufficient public interest dimensions.
                    The Applicant’s counsel cited the following reasons in support of his
                    public interest argument:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Applicant had obtained no
                        private pecuniary gain from these proceedings apart from ensuring compliance
                        with the law and her representation in Parliament;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     a significant portion of the public,
                        including constitutional law professors, shared the Applicant’s
                        views;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        resolution of the legal question before the court would give finality to an
                        issue of general public administration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     the challenge was “not doomed to
                        fail” as the construction of Art 49 of the Constitution involved
                        a complex, purposive interpretation exercise; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     the Applicant was being represented
                            <em>pro bono</em> and had sought amicable avenues
                        of resolution.</p>

                    review procedure have been brought to the foreground by the applications in
                    OS 196 which turned on our uniquely revised O 53. The unfolding of this
                    series of applications culminating in this costs application illustrates the
                    uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Under O 53 r 1(2), an applicant may apply for
                    quashing orders, prohibiting orders and mandatory orders by filing an <em>ex parte</em> originating summons but leave of court is
                    required to make the principal application. The requirement for leave for
                    judicial review is to enable the court to sieve out frivolous and hopeless
                    applications at an early stage. By contrast, an applicant may apply for a
                    declaration under O 15 r 16 without the leave of court. However, a
                    declaration granted under O 15 r 16 does not have the effect of
                    quashing, prohibiting or mandating decisions or actions. In 2011, O 53 was
                    amended to enable an applicant seeking quashing, prohibiting or mandatory orders
                    to include an application for a declaration: see the Final Judgment at
                    [31]–[34]. This amendment was the source of the procedural uncertainty
                    that influenced the conduct of these applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The leave application made by way of an
                        <em>ex parte</em> application must be supported by a
                    statement and affidavit which are to be served on the AG no later than the day
                    preceding the hearing of the <em>ex parte</em> application:
                    O 53 r 1(3). Such service does not transform what is an <em>ex parte</em> application into an <em>inter
                        partes</em> application. Accordingly, in the event that the court
                    grants leave, the originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit,
                    the order granting leave and the summons filed must be served on all persons
                    directly affected and other parties to the proceedings: see O 53 r
                2(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Singapore’s practice with respect to
                    attendance and representation at the <em>ex parte</em>
                    leave application hearing is varied. Based on reported decisions, where the
                    putative respondent is a non-governmental tribunal or agency, the AG may
                    nevertheless attend and assist the court in the hearing to decide whether or not
                    to grant leave. However, no reported cases have been brought to my attention in
                    which the AG had sought or had been awarded costs for such
                attendance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Where leave is granted, the substantive
                    application proceeds between the applicant and the directly affected
                    non-governmental tribunal or agency. In these cases, the AG is <em>not</em> a party in such substantive application. However, if
                    it is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be
                    effectually and completely determined or adjudicated upon, the court may on its
                    own motion or upon application order that the AG be joined as a party: O 15
                    r 6(2)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Lim Mey Lee Susan v
                        Singapore Medical Council</em> [2011] SGHC 131, the applicant had
                    served notice of the <em>ex parte</em> leave application
                    not only on the AG but also on the putative respondent. The putative
                    respondent’s counsel then appeared at the hearing to oppose leave being
                    granted. The court granted leave and awarded costs in the cause: at
                [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Yeap
                        </em><em>Wai Kong v Singapore Exchange Securities
                        Trading Ltd</em> [2012] 3 SLR 565, where notice had been
                    served on the AG, the court further directed the Applicant to serve notice on
                    the putative respondent in order to hear their representations at the <em>ex parte</em> leave application hearing. Leave was granted
                    but no cost orders were then sought or made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Where the judicial review application is
                    directed at the Government of Singapore (“the Government”), and
                    the AG attends and opposes the application for leave to proceed with the
                    judicial review application as the Government’s counsel, it is open to
                    both the applicant and the AG to make costs applications and for the court to
                    award costs for the leave application. In <em>Jeyaretnam Kenneth
                        Andrew v Attorney-General</em> [2012] SGHC 210, the
                    application for leave was dismissed with costs ordered against the applicant.
                    Where leave is granted, the corollary principle would be that costs may be
                    applied for by the applicant and the court may in its discretion make a costs
                    order: see O 53 r 1(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Government Proceedings Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The starting point for awarding costs in court
                    proceedings against the Government is s 29 of the Government Proceedings
                    Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the GPA”) which provides
                    that in any civil proceedings (defined in s 2(2) of the GPA to include
                    judicial review proceedings), to which the Government or a public officer is a
                    party, the court shall have power to order costs for or against the Government
                    or public officer in the same manner and upon the same principles as in
                    proceedings between private persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Costs are in the discretion of the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The principles governing costs application in
                    civil proceedings is encapsulated in O 59. Order 59 r 1 describes
                    the different costs orders and their effects. Order 59 r 2(2)
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the express provisions of any written law and of these Rules,
                        the costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court or the
                        Subordinate Courts, including the administration of estates and trusts shall
                        be in the discretion of the Court, and the Court shall have full power to
                        determine by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Order 59 r 3(2) goes on to state the general
                    rule that costs follow the event:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order
                        as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Court <em>shall</em>, <em>subject to this Order,
                            order the costs to follow the event, except </em><em>when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the
                            case some other order should be made</em> as to the whole or any
                        part of the costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The power to award costs is in the full
                    discretion of the court. Order 59 r 2(2) unequivocally states that
                    “the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent
                    the costs are to be paid.” This discretionary power is extremely broad:
                        <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 95 at [15]. Within this discretionary power, general guidance
                    is provided under O 59 r 3(2) that costs follow the event except where
                    it appears to the court that in the circumstances of the case some other order
                    should be made. The “overriding concern of the court must be to exercise
                    its discretion to achieve the fairest allocation of costs”: <em>Soon Peng Yam and another</em> (<em>trustees
                        of the Chinese Swimming Club</em>) <em>v Maimon bte
                        Ahmad</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 279 at [31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The underlying common law principles of costs
                    orders in civil and judicial review proceedings was explained in <em>R v Lord Chancellor</em>,<em>ex parte Child
                        Poverty Action Group</em> [1999] 1 WLR 347
                        (“<em>Child Poverty Action Group</em>”)
                    at 355–356 (<em>per</em> Dyson J):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The starting point must be the basic rule encapsulated
                            in RSC Ord 62, r 3(3) that costs follow the event</em>. It is true
                        that the role of the court in all public law cases is to ensure that public
                        bodies do not exceed or abuse their powers, but the parties to such
                        proceedings are nevertheless adverse as is the litigation. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accept ... that what lies behind the general rule that costs follow the
                        event is the principle that it is an important function of rules as to costs
                        to encourage parties in a sensible approach to increasingly expensive
                        litigation. Where any claim is brought in court, costs have to be incurred
                        on either side against a background of greater or lesser degrees of risk as
                        to the ultimate result. <em>If it transpires that the
                            respondent has acted unlawfully, it is generally right that it should
                            pay the claimant’s costs of establishing that. If it transpires
                            that the claimant’s claim is ill-founded, it is generally right
                            that it should pay the respondent’s costs of having to
                            respond.</em> This general rule promotes discipline within the
                        litigation system, compelling parties to assess carefully for themselves the
                        strength of any claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The basic rule that costs follow the event ensures
                            that the assets of the successful party are not depleted by reason of
                            having to go to court to meet a claim by an unsuccessful party.
                            </em></b>
<b><em>This is as desirable in public law cases
                            as it is in private law cases</em></b>. ... [W]here an unsuccessful
                        claim is brought against a public body, it imposes costs on that body which
                        have to be met out of public funds diverted from the funds available to
                        fulfil its primary public functions. ... It is plainly right that in the
                        normal run of the mill public law case, the unsuccessful party should pay
                        the other side’s costs. ... <em>Nevertheless, in

                            interest challenge cases, in my view it is important to have in mind the
                            rationale for that basic rule, and that it is for the applicants to show
                            why, exceptionally, there should be a departure from

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In Singapore, the general rule that costs
                    follow the event also applies in judicial review proceedings: <em>Re Siah Mooi Guat</em> [1988] 3 MLJ 448; <em>Teo </em><em>Soh Lung v Minister for Home Affairs and
                        others</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 347; and <em>Chee
                        Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 582. It is noteworthy that a successful applicant in judicial
                    review proceedings may be awarded costs, as was the case in <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs and others and other
                        appeals</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Public interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There are at least two broad circumstances
                    under which the courts have exercised their discretion and made some other
                    order. The first circumstance relates to the conduct of the successful party,
                    and the second concerns public interest. As there is nothing before this court
                    that the conduct of either party would provide grounds for some other order, I
                    shall confine the analysis to the public interest issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As costs awards are entirely within the
                    discretion of the court, it would be a matter of first principles that public
                    interest constitutes a relevant consideration. The Singapore courts have invoked
                    public interest as a basis to depart from the general rule that costs follow the
                    event with respect to proceedings involving unsuccessful regulators. In
                        <em>Top Ten</em>, a case concerning the costs
                    implications for the Law Society in respect of disciplinary proceedings under
                    the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed), the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    endorsed (at [24]) the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle
                    that costs should ordinarily not be ordered against unsuccessful public bodies
                    performing regulatory functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The public interest rationale for not ordering
                    costs against the public body exercising a regulatory function was explained in
                    the same case at first instance by Moses LJ in <em>Baxendale-Walker v Law Society</em>
                    [2006] EWHC 643 (Admin) at [43]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43.    …
                            <em>A regulator brings proceedings in the

                                to perform.</em> In those circumstances the principles
                            applicable to an award of costs differ from those in relation to private
                            civil litigation. <em>Absent dishonesty or a lack of good
                                faith, a costs order should not be made against such a regulator
                                unless there is good reason to do so. That reason must be more than
                                that the other party has succeeded.</em> In considering an
                            award of costs against a public regulator the court must consider on the
                            one hand the financial prejudice to the particular complainant, weighed
                            against the need to encourage public bodies to exercise their public
                            function of making reasonable and sound decisions without fear of
                            exposure to undue financial prejudice, if the decision is successfully

                    on the relevance of public interest in the award of costs in public law
                    proceedings: see the Privy Council decision in <em>New Zealand
                        Maori Council and others v Attorney-General</em> [1994]
                    1 AC 466 (concerning the protection of the Maori language in New
                    Zealand); the High Court of Australia decision in <em>Oshlack v
                        Richmond River Council</em> (1998) 193 CLR 72 (concerning
                    the preservation of flora and fauna); and the House of Lords decision in
                        <em>R</em> (<em>Corner House
                        Research</em>) <em>v Secretary of State for Trade and
                        </em><em>Industry</em> [2005]
                    1 WLR 2600 (concerning the lack of consultation by a governmental
                    department). While what may be regarded as being in the public interest in each
                    of these other common law jurisdictions would be quite different from what the
                    Singapore courts would regard as public interest given our own legal and policy
                    context, there is no doubt that public interest considerations may be taken into
                    account by the court in determining the costs for judicial review
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning to the essential characteristics of
                    public interest, it has been held that where a matter raises a legal question of
                    genuine public concern, it may be inappropriate to make a costs order against
                    the applicant even where the judicial review is wholly unsuccessful: see Sir
                    Michael Supperstone <em>et al</em>, <em>Judicial Review</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2010) at [20.24.2]. As a
                    broad general principle, I find Dyson J’s holding in <em>Child Poverty Action Group</em> (at 353) to be
                    apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I should start by explaining what I understand to be meant by a public
                        interest challenge. <b><em>The essential characteristics of a
                            public law challenge are that it raises public law issues which are of
                            general importance, where the applicant has no private interest in the
                            outcome of the case</em></b><b>. </b><em>It is obvious that many, indeed most judicial review
                            challenges, do not fall into the category of public interest challenges
                            so defined. This is because, even if they do raise issues of general
                            importance, they are cases in which the applicant is seeking to protect
                            some private interest of his or her own.</em> The central
                        submission advanced on behalf of the applicants is that, because of those
                        essential characteristics, the court should be more willing to make no order
                        as to costs against an unsuccessful applicant in public interest challenge
                        cases than in other cases. It is submitted that public interest challenges
                        are not “ordinary litigation” between adverse parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     At their very core, court proceedings carry
                    public interest where they raise public law issues of general importance, and in
                    which the applicant is not seeking to protect some private interest. It is
                    important to emphasise that public interest dimensions are not established for
                    the purposes of costs by reason only that public law issues are raised or that
                    leave has been granted to proceed with the judicial review hearing. Ultimately,
                    whether public interest warrants departure from the general rule that costs
                    follow the event will depend entirely on the particular facts in each
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Based on the above analysis, I now come to my
                    decision on the appropriate costs of the applications determined in the Final
                    Judgment. The questions raised in the Reserved Application and determined by the
                    Final Judgment concerned public law issues of general importance. This was
                    underscored by contemporaneous extensive debates amongst Members of Parliament
                    both within Parliament and in the media, constitutional law academics and the
                    public on the internet and print media. Additionally, the Applicant did not have
                    a private interest in the question relating to the filling of vacant seats of
                    elected Members of Parliament. This public interest was extant at the time of
                    the Applicant’s reservation of her right to seek the declarations under O
                    15 r 16, <em>ie</em>, the date of the hearing of the Leave
                    Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In these unusual circumstances, I make no
                    order as to costs for all the applications leading to the Final Judgment and
                    this costs hearing.</p>

Media Summary<br/>
<br/>
Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General [2012] SGHC 221<br/>
<em>Originating Summons No. 196 of 2012/G<br/>
</em><br/>
Decision of the High Court (delivered by Justice Philip Pillai)</p>
<p><strong></strong><br/>
1     On 28 February 2012, the Parliamentary seat for Hougang Single Member Constituency (“SMC”) was declared vacant. On 2 March 2012, the Applicant filed judicial review applications seeking a Mandatory Order and two Declarations that Article 49 of the Constitution required the Prime Minister to call a by-election. <br/>
<br/>
2     On 3 April 2012, the Applicant’s application for leave (“Leave Application”) to proceed with the judicial review was granted. On 9 May 2012, a writ of election calling for a by-election in Hougang SMC was issued by the President, and a by-election was held on 26 May 2012. <br/>
<br/>
3     The Applicant proceeded and filed her substantive application  on 29 May 2012 (“the Substantive Application”). At the hearing of the Substantive Application on 16 July 2012, she abandoned her application for the Mandatory Order and proceeded with her application for the declarations under O 53 and her previously Reserved Application for the Declarations. Her Substantive Application and Reserved Application were dismissed by the court for the reasons set out in the final judgment on 1 August 2012.<br/>
<br/>
4     This present judgment is about the costs of all the applications based on submissions made by both counsel after the release of the final judgment. <br/>
<br/>
5     The Applicant’s counsel now sought costs for her successful Leave Application and for those costs to be set off against the costs to be awarded to the Attorney-General (“AG”) who was successful in the final judgment. The AG’s counsel submitted that costs for the Leave Application should now be determined to have been costs in the cause and sought total costs of S$10,000. The Applicant’s counsel then submitted that there should be no costs orders against the Applicant on the grounds of public interest: at [23].  <br/>
<br/>
6     On the costs for the Leave Application, after leave was granted, it was open to both parties to make submissions on costs for the Leave Application based on the then prevailing circumstances. However, both parties did not then make any submission for costs. An impartial and fair determination of the costs for the Leave Application cannot now be made because of the overhang of the known final judgment. The Court therefore declined to determine costs for the Leave Application in these circumstances: see [13]–[18]. <br/>
<br/>
7     As both counsel submitted on the basis of all applications determined by the final judgment the court proceeded on this same basis. The Court has full discretion to determine costs. Whilst costs are generally awarded to the successful party, public interest considerations are relevant considerations to the exercise of this discretion: at [32]–[44]. Public interest is engaged where there are questions of law of general public importance and where the applicant has no private interest in the proceedings. On the particular circumstances of these proceedings, the Court found both to be present. In particular the Court found that the constitutional questions raised by the declarations were of general public importance as reflected in extensive contemporaneous debates by Members of Parliament both within Parliament and in the media, amongst constitutional law academics and on the internet and print media: at [45].<br/>
<br/>
8     The Court ordered no order as to costs for the applications leading to the final judgment and the costs hearing. </p>
