<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">By an amended Originating Summons the

plaintiff, an advocate and solicitor, applied for, among other reliefs, a declaration that

the defendant should have referred his letter of complaint dated 18 August 1999 against

Davinder Singh SC (DS) and Hri Kumar (HK), who are also advocates and solicitors, to the

Chairman of the Inquiry Panel. Briefly the letter alleged that both DS and HK prepared or

caused to be prepared two affidavits which were alleged to contain 4 falsehoods. At the

conclusion of the hearing, I concluded that the first three complaints were baseless and

frivolous and plainly did not and could not fall within s 85(1) of the Legal Profession

Act, Cap 161 ("the Act").</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 However, with regard to the alleged 4<sup>th</sup>

falsehood, learned counsel for the defendant, quite properly in my view, drew my attention

not only generally to the documentary evidence in two pages but the particular passages of

or columns in two exhibits annexed to the affidavit prepared and filed by DS and HK on

behalf of their clients. He conceded that the plaintiff’s 4<sup>th</sup> complaint

fell within s 85(1) of the Act. In fairness to both DS and HK I hasten to add that whether

there is a prima facie case of misconduct against them is a matter strictly for the

Inquiry Committee to be constituted. Counsel for the defendant readily accepted right from

the beginning that it was not within the duty or the jurisdiction of the Council of the

Law Society to determine if there was a prima facie case. But he submitted that the

Council had the right and the duty to determine if the complaint was one that fell within

s 85(1) of the Act. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that s 85(1) of the Act in

terms make it mandatory on the part of the Council of the defendant to refer a complaint

to the Chairman of the Inquiry Committee. The Council, he said, had no role in the matter

except to act as a "conduit". I accepted the submissions of counsel for

defendant and made the declaration which was limited to the 4<sup>th</sup> complaint. As

the plaintiff insisted that all 4 complaints should be referred to the Chairman of the

Inquiry Committee and lost on his main submission that the function of the Council of the

Law Society was limited to the administrative task of referring all complaints to the

Chairman of the Inquiry Committee, I ordered that the plaintiff should pay the defendant

costs fixed at $2,500.00.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The complaints of the plaintiff arose

out of another set of proceedings in which DS and HK acted for a bank. In Originating

Summons 546 of 1999 filed on 14 April 1999 UBS AG, who were previously the investment

bankers of the plaintiff, made an application seeking the court’s directions as to

the return of assets previously held in the accounts of the plaintiff and his family,

namely his wife and son. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The plaintiff and his family began their

banking relationship with UBS since 18 August 1997. They opened a joint account in their

name with UBS’s Singapore branch. On the same day, the plaintiff and his family

opened a joint account in their names with the Hong Kong branch of UBS. A little later,

the plaintiff opened an account No. 207012 in his sole name with the Hong Kong branch of

UBS. The plaintiff by himself and at times jointly with family engaged in foreign exchange

transactions. Some of those transactions were affected by the fall of the Malaysian

Ringgit as against the US dollars. In September 1997 the plaintiff and his family were in

a loss position on forex forward contracts. In December 1997 the plaintiff invested a sum

slightly in excess of US$10 million in a Fund established by UBS. Forex transactions

continued. The banking relationship was, I think it’s fair to say, somewhat

turbulent. From May 1998 the plaintiff and his family made a number of allegations against

UBS and its officers. He alleged that UBS and their officers had made a number of

misrepresentations and were negligent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 Inevitably, the banking relationship was

terminated. All of the three accounts were closed. But UBS’s return of the assets to

the plaintiff and his family, which could have been done with the written consent of the

plaintiff and members of his family, was not uneventful. Hence the originating summons. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 The plaintiff was obviously peeved by

those proceedings and by the fact, as he complained, that UBS had joined his family as

fellow defendants. The plaintiff and his family applied to stay the proceedings in

Singapore in favour of Hong Kong. He complained that he had no personal knowledge as to

how his assets were transferred to the account in Singapore. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 On 18 August 1999 the plaintiff lodged

his complaint against DS and HK with the Council of the defendant. His letter, addressed

to the President of the Law Society, was in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">August 18, 1999</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The President,<br/>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">SIR</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. I hereby lodge a complaint touching

  upon the professional misconduct of Senior Counsel Daviinder Singh M.P. and his legal

  assistant one Hri Kumar both of Drew &amp; Napier pursuant to s.85 of the Legal Profession

  Act CAP 161 [LPA].</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Both of them are Officers of the

  Supreme Court by virtue of s.82(1) of the LPA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. Section 82(2)(b) &amp; (h) of the LPA

  provides that they may be visited by the rigours of the LPA and may be liable to be struck

  off the Roll or suspended from practice or censured if they are:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i.) found guilty of fraudulent or grossly

    improper conduct in the discharge of their professional duty; and/or</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii.) found guilty of misconduct

    unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or <u>as a member

    of an honourable profession</u>. It is submitted that a MP comes within the purview of

    s.83(2)(h).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. In Re An Advocate &amp; Solicitor

  (1962) 28 MLJ 125 it was held by a Court of 3 judges that "the preparation by a

  professional man of an affidavit that is untrue and known to him to be untrue, is a very

  serious offence. As has been said so often, an advocate and solicitor is an Officer of the

  Court and as such he owes a duty not only to himself and to his client but also to the

  Court". The same principles should apply equally to honourable Members of Parliament.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. The cases are legion in which

  solicitors have been disciplined for administration of justice offences. For example, from

  as early as 1869, a solicitor has been suspended for 10 years from practice for allowing

  his client to make a false affidavit – <i>see in Re Gray, ex p Inc Law Soc <nobr>[1869] 20 LT 730</nobr>.</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6 As a further example, it was also

  held that where a solicitor deliberately arranged for a witness to be kept out of the way

  he was found guilty of grossly improper conduct – <i>see <nobr>[1953] MLJ 161</nobr>. </i>In the

  administration of justice, this was so even though his intention was more of annoying the

  police rather than bringing about a miscarriage of justice.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7. Furthermore, in a recent article in the

  Straits Times 1 June 1999 – <i><b>"Behave, CJ WARNS LAWYERS" </b></i>some

  3,200 lawyers in Singapore were urged by the Chief Justice not to let their personal greed

  and self-interest override the moral principles of integrity and honesty. [For] "<i>if

  you allow yourself to stoop to dishonest and unethical behaviour [such as preparing a

  false affidavit for a client for the purposes of perjury], you will not only destroy the

  trust of your clients in you, but also of society’s opinion of the legal profession

  as an honourable one". </i>He further warned that the court would take strong

  disciplinary action against lawyers who are found guilty of such misconduct. Annexed

  hereto and marked <b>"ASKW-1"</b> is a copy thereof.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8. <u>RELEVANT BACKGROUND FACTS</u>: On

  about 14 April 1999, Senior Counsel Singh and his assistant Hri Kumar of Drew &amp; Napier

  filed proceedings on behalf of UBS AG Singapore in Originating Summons 546 of 1999 [OS

  546/99]. The proceedings were filed to annoy and embarrass my wife and my son cited as

  Defendant. The purpose of the proceedings was for the delivery of my personal Hong Kong

  assets to them in Singapore. On a date unknown, UBS AG Hong Kong transferred from my

  account 207038 in Hong Kong my personal "Assets" to a joint account 110628 in

  Singapore against my written instructions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. <u>THE MISCONDUCT</u>: Senior Counsel

  Singh MP and his assistant Kumar of Drew and Napier knowingly prepared an affidavit which

  contained certain allegations that were false and/or otherwise permitted Shirreen Sin Meng

  Mei [SSMM] an employee of their client UBS AG to perjure herself in a Court of Law.

  Annexed hereto and marked collectively <b>"ASKW-2"</b> are copies of said

  affidavit together with a copy of the Originating Summons 546 of 1999 [OS 546/99].

  Particulars of the falsehoods are as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. <u>FALSEHOOD #1</u>: By paragraph 3

  thereof, said SSMM alleged that the "Assets" <i>"were previously held in

  the Defendant’ accounts with the Plaintiff"</i>. Said allegation is, as they

  well knew, false because at all material times they knew that the "Assets" were

  never held in the <i>"Defendant’ accounts" </i>[207012 in Hong Kong or

  110628 in Hong Kong. The Assets in question as they well knew belonged to me and me alone

  held under a personal account 207038 in Hong Kong. Said knowledge appears in the ensuing

  paragraph 6.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">11. <u>FALSEHOOD #2</u>: Senior Counsel

  who is concurrently an M.P. then went on to allege that the "… <i>said sum

  [US$4,334.61] was transferred from the Hong Kong account No 207038 on 10 September

  1997".</i> Said allegation was, as he well knew, false because by virtue of being a

  legal adviser, he had, at all material times, access to the internal records touching upon

  my customer/banker accounts. The internal records reveal that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10.1: On 9 September 1998 UBS AG Hong Kong

    branch was instructed by me not to take instructions from Shirreen Sin and/or one N. Wood

    of UBS AG with regard to my Hong Kong accounts 207038 and 207012. Annexed hereto and

    marked <b>"ASKW-3"</b> is a copy of the fax instructions dated 9 September 1998.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10.2: On 10 September 1998, UBS AG Hong

    Kong without my instructions transferred a sum of US$4,185,000 [four million one hundred

    and eighty five thousand] from my personal Hong Kong account 207038 to a joint account

    110628 in Singapore. Annexed hereto and marked <b>"ASKW-4"</b> is a copy of a

    fax from the said N. Wood in Singapore dated 10 September 1998 to that effect.

    Consequently, the transfer of a sum of US$4,334.61 [say four thousand three hundred and

    thirty four and cents sixty one] on 10 September 1998 in the manner alleged is false.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. <u>FALSEHOOD #3</u>: Senior Counsel

  Singh MP continued in the same vein as reflected in paragraph 4 where he alleged falsely

  that the Defendant claimed that <i>"the dispute herein is more closely connected to <b>Hong

  Kong</b> than to Singapore". </i>This is not an expression of an opinion in law. This

  statement of fact is false in light of my statement as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman">"I also emphasise that the letter

    of offer for the facilities expressly provided that the governing law of the facilities

    for the Hong Kong bank accounts was Hong Kong and that both parties submitted themselves

    irrevocably to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of Hong Kong. Clearly any disputes arising

    out of or relating to the facilities on my Hong Kong accounts should be governed by Hong

    Kong law".</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">13. <u>FALSEHOOD #4</u>: Paragraph 5 is

  false made to found the doctrine of forum non conveniens on the grounds that <i>"The

  account opening forms for all three accounts were prepared by the Plaintiff UBS AG] <u><b>in

  Singapore</b></u> and executed by the Defendant <u><b>in Singapore</b></u> </i>[emphasis

  added]. The allegation was coloured with the following:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman">"I introduced Wee to the

    Plaintiff’s banking services sometime in August 1997. My discussions with Wee took

    place <u>in Singapore</u>. As a result of these discussions, the Defendant opened a joint

    account No. 110628 ("the Singapore Account") on 18 August 1997 and two accounts

    in Wee’s sole name No. 207038 on 26 August 1997. The account opening forms <u><b>for

    all three accounts</b></u> were prepared by the Plaintiff <u><b>in Singapore and executed

    by the Defendant in Singapore</b></u>"</font></i></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is a falsehood made knowingly as

    follows:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">14. The "internal records" of

  UBS AG Singapore reveal that the account opening documents in respect of 110628, 207012

  &amp; 207038 were not <u>ALL</u> prepared and signed in Singapore. They prove that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">i. only two sets of standard account

    opening forms relating to joint private bank accounts numbered 110628 &amp; 207012 were

    dated 18 August 1997 prepared and duly witnessed by SSMM <i><b>in Singapore.</b></i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">ii. one similar set of standard

    account opening forms relating to a personal account numbered 207038 were dated 26 August

    1997 prepared and duly witnessed by one Sheila Wong of UBS AG <i><b>in Hong Kong</b></i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">iii. I was in Hong Kong on 26 August 1997

    when said Sheila Wong attended to me and presented the account opening for the purposes of

    obtaining my signature thereon to open my personal account number 207038 in Hong Kong.

    Annexed hereto and marked <b>"ASKW-5"</b> is a relevant extract of my passport

    entries proving that I was in Hong Kong from 24 August 1997 and did not return to

    Singapore until 11 September 1997. Annexed hereto and marked collectively <b>"ASKW-6"</b>

    are copies of the account opening documents in respect of the accounts 110628, 207012 and

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 After receipt of the complaint, the

Council of the defendant requested for copies of all affidavits filed and served in OS 546

of 1999, The plaintiff sent them to the Council in September 1999. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 By a letter dated 5 November 1999 the

Director of the defendant stated that a recent meeting the Council of the defendant

decided that in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Tan Liang Hong v Lee

Kuan Yew &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 97</nobr> no information of misconduct which must be referred

to the Chairman of the Inquiry Committee was disclosed in the plaintiff’s letter of

complaint. The plaintiff asked for the basis upon which the Court of Appeal

"empowered the Council to disregard due process of an inquiry committee to determine

the facts complained of."</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 By his letter of 9 December 1999 the

then President of the defendant, George Lim, set out the position in this way:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In the case of <i>Tang Liang Hong v

  Lee Kuan Yew (1998) 1 SLR 97, </i>the Court of Appeal held that a solicitor did not have

  the duty to verify the truth or otherwise of an affidavit affirmed by his client. LP

  Thean, JA said:-</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, we think it would be

    placing an unduly onerous burden on counsel in every instance to verify the truth or

    otherwise of what their clients have deposed to in affidavit. In this respect, Chan Sek

    Keong JC (as he then was) held in Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore (1988)

    SLR 510, at p515 as follows:</font></i></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…TKQ was under no duty (I)

    specifically, to take statements from the clients named in GSH’s affidavit; (ii)

    generally, to verify the source of information of GSH. Counsel for the plaintiff was

    unable to cite any authority to support his contention that an advocate and solicitor has

    such a duty generally or in the circumstances of this case. Nor was he able to persuade

    me, in principle, that such a duty exited. In my view, no such duty existed generally or

    in the circumstances of this case. It is not for an advocate and solicitor, whether in his

    capacity as counsel or solicitor, to believe or disbelieve his client’s instructions,

    unless his client’s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible. His

    duty to his client does not go beyond advising him of the folly of making incredible or

    illogical statements.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We agree with the judge."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 The plaintiff asserted that the

explanation left him "none the wiser". He therefore commenced these proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 The complaint was lodged under s 85(1)

of the Act. It states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Any complaint of the conduct of an

  advocate and solicitor shall in the first place be made to the Society and the Council

  shall refer the complaint to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 The scope of the Council’s role on

receipt of a complaint was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i>P Suppiah v The Law

Society of Singapore</i> <nobr>[1986] 1 MLJ 459</nobr>. The same provision, though amended but in

respects immaterial for present purposes, was considered by the Court of Appeal in the

light of the submission by counsel for P Suppiah, the plaintiff himself, who contended

that the Council on receipt of Suppiah’s letter was obliged under section 86(1) of

the Legal Profession Act, Cap 217 to refer it to the Inquiry Committee, because the

sub-section said that the Council "shall refer to the …complaint to the Inquiry

Committee." Apparently, the plaintiff as counsel in that case had gone on to submit

that it was not the concern, nor was it within the power, of the Council to decide whether

a prima facie case touching on the conduct of the advocate and solicitor in question in

his professional capacity had been disclosed. The first part of those submissions was

firmly rejected by the Court of Appeal. However, the second part of those submissions was

upheld. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Where a person makes …a complaint

  which falls within the meaning of section 86(1) of the Act, it is mandatory on the part of

  the Council to refer it to the Inquiry Committee. On the other hand, where …a

  complaint does not fall within that sub-section, the Council has no such obligation and,

  indeed, will be obliged to reject it. From this, it follows that the Council must on

  receipt of …a complaint consider whether it comes within section 86(1). However, the

  Council should not consider further whether the …complaint discloses a prima facie

  case against the advocate and solicitor concerned. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 That the Council must apply its mind

and consider the question whether a complaint falls within section 85(1) of the Act is

eminently reasonable. The Council is largely an elected body and comprises of elected

members in whom members of the Law Society have reposed confidence. As envisaged under the

Act, they constitute a responsible body of opinion on what professional misconduct which

merits an inquiry and what is outside it. While they have a duty in the public interest to

maintain honour and standards of probity amongst members, they have a duty too in the

public interest to ensure that members of the Honourable profession are not subjected to

the trauma and expense of a disciplinary inquiry if the complaint is one which clearly is

outside the scope of the subsection. If a Council should mis-direct itself when

considering this question, or if it elides into considering the question whether there is

prima facie case, it is subject to judicial review and an appropriate declaration may be

obtained to reverse a wrong decision. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 The question is therefore whether the

Council of the defendant was right in deciding that none of the complaints was within the

subsection. I turn to each of the 4 complaints of the plaintiff. Before I do so, I should

refer to the allegations of misconduct as summarised by the plaintiff in para 9 of his

letter of complaint. He alleged that DS and HK "knowingly prepared an affidavit which

contained certain allegations that were false and/or otherwise permitted Shirren Sin Meng

Mei ("SS"), an employee of UBS, to perjure herself in a Court of Law". The

allegation that DS and HK had assisted or aided the deponent in her alleged perjury are

serious allegations. The important question was to see if there was any basis which

brought the complaint within the subsection. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 I turn to the first complaint as

summarised in the plaintiff’ letter. On the materials produced before the Council,

the picture that emerged was that some of the assets were earlier owned by all three of

them, namely the plaintiff and his family. In the context of the banking relationship and

the fact that some of the assets were earlier owned by all three of them, any prudent

banker would seek directions as UBS did. I agreed with counsel for the defendant that

there was no complaint within the meaning of section 85(1) because there was no perjury by

the deponent. All the more, I could not see how the lawyers could have known that it was a

lie. A bare and bold allegation does not convert a mere assertion or a fantasy into a

complaint within the meaning of the subsection. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 The complaint under the pejorative

rubric of "Falsehood #2" is set out in para 11 of the plaintiff’s letter.

He alleged that by virtue of being a legal adviser DS had access to the internal records.

Those records would have revealed that the plaintiff had withdrawn the authority of the

two named officers and that there were the unauthorised transfers. The fact was that the

transfers were not themselves lies. It was quite a different matter whether the transfers

were authorised or not. Again, there was no basis for the assertion.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 The third complaint, which was labelled

unfairly as "Falsehood #3", was based on para 4 of the affidavit of Shirreen

Sin. It has to be noted that in para 12 of his affidavit the plaintiff rather

disingenuously attempted to muddy the waters by referring to para 5 of the affidavit of

Shirreen Sin which had nothing to do with complaint #3 but which was relevant for

complaint #4. I was not impressed by his attempt. The statement complained of was

contained in para 4 of the deponent’s second affidavit . It stated: "The

Defendants (namely the plaintiff and his family) claim that these proceedings should have

been commenced in Hong Kong as the dispute herein is more closely connected to Hong Kong

than to Singapore." It was on its face a summary of the contention or position of the

plaintiff and his family in their capacities as the defendants in the other Originating

Summons. It was not a statement of fact but a summary of the plaintiff’s position

regarding the question of the most convenient forum which should adjudicate on the

Originating Summons. There was therefore no complaint within the meaning of section 85(1).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 As I had stated, I granted a limited

declaratory order in respect of the fourth complaint. In the last sentence of para 5

Sheerrin Sin deposed thus: "The account opening forms for all the three accounts were

prepared by the Plaintiff (ie UBS) in Singapore and executed by the Defendants (ie the

plaintiff and his family) in Singapore." Learned counsel for the defendant drew my

attention specifically to two places at pp 56 and 63 of the exhibit SSMM-2 in which it was

clear, once attention was drawn to it, that the accounts opening forms and documents were

signed by the plaintiff in Hong Kong. It followed that there was a basis for the complaint

to amount to a complaint within the meaning of section 85(1) of the Act.</font></p>
