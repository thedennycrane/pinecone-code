<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two accused persons (“Daniel”
                    and “Christopher”) were originally charged with a third person,
                    Nakamuthu Balakrishnan (“Bala”) with a joint charge of murder. All
                    three men were convicted by me after a trial (see <em>PP v Daniel
                        Vijay s/o Katherasan and others</em>
                    [2008] SGHC 120).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Daniel’s
                    and Christopher’s convictions for murder were set aside after the Court of
                    Appeal revisited and restated the law relating to section 34 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). Both of them were convicted instead for the
                    offence of robbery with hurt under section 394 read with section 34 of the
                    Penal Code. The Court of Appeal also remitted their case to me as trial judge
                    for me to consider their sentence on the substituted joint charge. Bala decided
                    not to proceed with his appeal against conviction for murder. Nevertheless, his
                    conviction for murder was reviewed and upheld by the Court of Appeal (see the
                    Court of Appeal’s judgment dated 3 September 2010 in <em>Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v PP</em>
                    [2010] SGCA 33 at [185] and [186]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substituted charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 394 of the Penal Code provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery,
                        voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person, jointly
                        concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be
                        punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more
                        than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12
                        strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Section 34 of the Penal Code states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the
                        common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
                        same manner as if the act were done by him alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Previous convictions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Daniel had a conviction under the Road Traffic
                    Act (Cap 276) in February 2003 for taking or driving a motor vehicle
                    without lawful authority. Another charge for the same type of offence was taken
                    into consideration. He was fined $1,000 by a district court. He paid the fine.
                    In March 2005, he was convicted again for such an offence, with one other charge
                    for the same type of offence taken into consideration. He was again fined $1,000
                    by a district court. This time, he served 10 days’ imprisonment in default
                    as he did not pay the fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Christopher has no criminal
                record.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The prosecution argued that “the
                    imposition of a sufficiently lengthy custodial sentence and caning which falls
                    at the upper end of the tariff provided under Section 394 of the Penal
                    Code” was warranted in the light of the seriousness of the offence
                    perpetrated as well as the grave consequences of the robbery. The prosecution
                    submitted that the principle of retribution must take centre-stage as the victim
                    died as a result of the robbery committed by the three men.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The prosecution relied on the findings of fact
                    made at the trial (see <em>PP v Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2008] SGHC 120) as these findings were left
                    practically intact by the Court of Appeal. From these findings, it was clear
                    that Daniel and Christopher had contemplated the use of violence in the robbery.
                    The attack on the victim by Bala was ruthless and vicious – at least 15
                    blows were delivered to the head and limbs. Neither Daniel nor Christopher
                    attempted or even contemplated stopping Bala from battering the victim with the
                    baseball bat. Both of them had agreed to and actively participated in the
                    robbery which they knew would entail the use of unprovoked, unwarranted and
                    disproportionate force to assault the victim to such an extent that he would not
                    be able to hinder or to identify them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The prosecution also submitted that general and
                    specific deterrence would be relevant in the sentencing of Daniel and
                    Christopher. They had no qualms about resorting to extreme and gratuitous
                    violence in the robbery. They were also in full control of their actions and
                    neither acted on the spur of the moment. The robbery was planned meticulously
                    and the victim was chosen for his vulnerability as he was not accompanied by a
                    cargo hand in his lorry. They played active roles in the robbery. There was
                    completely no remorse as they did not even consider calling for some assistance
                    for the victim after the severe assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The prosecution further submitted that the
                    principle of prevention of crime would be a relevant sentencing consideration.
                    The primary purpose of the criminal justice system is to prevent crime and to
                    ensure that justice for the guilty is swift, sure and severe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Where the principle of rehabilitation was
                    concerned, the prosecution argued that it could not be a dominant consideration
                    here despite the fact that Daniel was about 23 years old and Christopher about
                    24 years old at the time of the offence in May 2006. This was because the
                    factual matrix of the case coupled with the weight of the other sentencing
                    principles far overrode the role of rehabilitation here. The offence was so
                    serious, the actions of the robbers were so contemptible and the consequences
                    were so grave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There was no need to resort to violence as the
                    robbers outnumbered the victim by three to one. Inspite of this clear numerical
                    advantage, vicious violence was resorted to from the start. The fact that Daniel
                    and Christopher did not inflict the fatal injuries was immaterial as they, like
                    the offenders in <em>PP v Hirris Anak Martin &amp;
                        Anor</em> [2010] 2 SLR 976 (see [17]) (“<em>Hirris</em>”), had clearly intended that the weapon be
                    used in the robbery. The prosecution further relied on <em>Hirris</em> (at [15]), decided by the Court of Appeal in January this
                    year, that the established sentencing range for robbery cases involving death
                    was 12 to 20 years’ imprisonment. In that case, upon appeal by the
                    prosecution, the Court of Appeal enhanced the sentence for the charge under
                    section 394 read with section 397 of the Penal Code from 10 years’
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane to 15 years’ imprisonment and 24
                    strokes of the cane although the fatal head injuries were not inflicted by the
                    respondents. Section 397 provides for mandatory additional punishment of not
                    less than 12 strokes of the cane in cases where the offender is armed with or
                    uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt or attempts to cause death or
                    grievous hurt to any person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 2,700 mobile phones taken in the robbery
                    were valued at US$823,500. 542 of them, valued at US$165,310, have not been
                    recovered. The rest were recovered by the police without the assistance of the
                    robbers. The financial loss to the owners of the cargo was significant and
                    should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The prosecution also highlighted the sentences
                    imposed on the accomplices in this robbery by other courts. Arsan s/o
                    Krishnasamy Govindarajoo (“Arsan”), the mastermind behind the
                    robbery, pleaded guilty to a charge of abetting, by engaging in a conspiracy
                    with the three accused persons in this case, an offence under section 394 read
                    with sections 397 and 109 of the Penal Code. He also pleaded guilty to two other
                    charges under section 414 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. For the
                    robbery charge, he was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes
                    of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ragu A/L Ramajayam (“Ragu”), the
                    insider in the transport company who provided information about the cargo,
                    pleaded guilty to a charge of abetting Arsan to commit robbery, an offence under
                    section 392 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 6
                    years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. On appeal, his sentence
                    was reduced to 4 ½ years and 6 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The prosecution contended that Arsan’s
                    sentence should serve as a very strong guide as to the minimum appropriate
                    sentence for Daniel and Christopher here. Although Arsan was the one who hatched
                    the plan to rob, he was not at the scene of crime. Daniel and Christopher were
                    not only at the scene, they played direct and critical roles in the events which
                    eventually robbed the victim of both property and life. They were the ones who
                    lured the victim to where Bala was waiting with the baseball bat. Ragu’s
                    role was significantly less than the roles of Arsan, Daniel or Christopher. His
                    charge was also a less serious one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, the prosecution submitted that
                    offenders who did not inflict fatal injuries in previous cases have generally
                    been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Bearing in mind the degree of planning and
                    deliberation, the seriousness of the offence, the callous, wanton and gratuitous
                    violence inflicted and the value of the cargo taken, a higher level of
                    deterrence would be needed in this case. The prosecution therefore asked that
                    Daniel and Christopher be sentenced to more than 15 years’ imprisonment
                    and more than 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation plea and submissions for Daniel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Daniel is married and has three children aged
                    10, 9 and 6. His wife was not working. He was absent without official leave from
                    his national service duties at the time of the offence and was doing odd jobs to
                    support his family. He agreed to take part in the robbery for the same
                    reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The initial plan was simply that Daniel would
                    drive away the lorry carrying the cargo of mobile phones. The plan went awry
                    when the victim’s lorry did not stop long enough at the cargo
                    complex’s exit point for the robbers to hijack it. It was Bala who
                    instructed Daniel to follow the victim’s lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Daniel is extremely sorry for the events that
                    happened and is very remorseful that the victim died. He regrets all his
                    actions, starting from his desire to make quick money by agreeing to the
                    robbery. He is grateful that he has not been found guilty of murder and that he
                    will be able to be with his family again in the near future. He also apologises
                    to the victim’s family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     He pleaded for mercy. He has been in remand
                    since 5 June 2006 and requested that his imprisonment term be backdated
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was argued that the acts which resulted in
                    the victim’s death were done by Bala and that Daniel did not participate
                    in any of them. He “did not know that force would be used by [Bala] which
                    would be so severe as to result in the death of the victim”. He was aware
                    that the intention was to rob and that was to drive away the lorry with the
                    cargo on board. The acts which caused the victim’s death were never
                    planned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Given the relatively minor role played by
                    Daniel, who “merely went along and did whatever [Bala] planned to
                    do” and that the masterminds were Bala and Arsan, it was suggested that a
                    sentence of between 10 and 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the
                    cane would be sufficient punishment for Daniel. <em>Ang Ser Kuang
                        v PP</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 316, where a sentence of 6 years
                    and 12 strokes was upheld, was cited for comparison.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation plea and submissions for Christopher</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Counsel for Christopher urged the court
                    “to consider the imposition of a custodial sentence of up to 10
                    years’ imprisonment coupled with the necessary strokes of the cane to
                    leave Christopher with the message that even peripheral participants will be
                    punished significantly to guard against the proliferation of such
                    offences”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     While it was accepted that the Court of Appeal
                    did not make findings of fact regarding Christopher’s specific role in the
                    robbery, Christopher’s role was that of a driver who was privy to the
                    robbery plan. He asked for mercy and submitted that the level of his culpability
                    ought to be pegged at the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for robbery with
                    hurt cases where death has occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Christopher, now 28, was almost 24 years old
                    at the time of the robbery in May 2006. He was educated up to N-level and was
                    supposed to be serving national service at the material time. However, he was
                    absent without official leave since 2004 so that he could work as a daily-rated
                    driver for Bala in order to supplement his family’s meagre income. He is
                    the only son in his family and was living with his parents. His father was a
                    pastor who unfortunately suffered a serious stroke. His mother was a production
                    operator in a factory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Christopher was engaged to be married but his
                    participation in the robbery brought the engagement to an end. He was a very
                    heavy drinker. On the night before the robbery, he was drinking beer from about
                    8.30pm to about 1am.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     He surrendered to the authorities when he
                    learnt that they were looking for him and cooperated with them to the best of
                    his abilities. He admitted that he was a driver in the robbery. However, the
                    violent actions of Bala were not within his contemplation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In a handwritten letter handed by Christopher
                    to his counsel during the trial (for use in case the murder charge was reduced
                    to a non-capital one), he stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am deeply remorseful and unable to be consoled for the fact that the
                        victim had lost his life. I know that no sufficient words can replace the
                        loss to his loved ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, I am fervently asking God to give the family the divine
                        consolation they need at this hour. My heart goes out to the loved ones that
                        are going through this agony.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I feel that if I could in any way be of help to the family, I would be
                        more than willing to help them by all means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My poor mother did not fail to visit me even for a single day despite
                        having to work at night. It has broken my heart to see my mother cheering me
                        up. I hope and pray that God will answer her prayers that I will be able to
                        go back to the workforce to support my family. I realise only now the true
                        love of a mother for her son.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to earnestly appeal to your Honour in all sincerity and
                        humility to ask for mercy and grace based on my current situation. I
                        solemnly plead guilty to my presence at the time of the incident of the
                        robbery. I plead to your Honour to grant me one last opportunity to be able
                        to go back to the workforce and repay my mother for all the months of pain
                        she has undergone trying to support my family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to take a pledge before God and this Court that I will never
                        again be involved in any situation that could entail me to be sentenced by
                        this Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Christopher has no criminal antecedent save
                    for his absence from national service. He demonstrates no proclivity for
                    re-offending. The entire legal process has taken more than 4 years and he has
                    learnt a very bitter lesson. This will serve to deter him specifically from ever
                    breaking the law again. His role as a driver was a peripheral one and he
                    received only $500 from Bala for his role. It was also clear that he was
                    controlled by Bala throughout. The last instruction from Bala was for
                    Christopher to drive away with the two pallets of mobile phones to Ang Mo Kio so
                    as to deceive Arsan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     
          <em>Hirris</em> is a
                    useful guide for sentencing offenders who participate significantly in robberies
                    involving death but is of limited assistance when determining the level of
                    culpability of peripheral participants such as Christopher. In that case, both
                    respondents participated in the “callous and wanton” assault of
                    the victim who eventually died. Although the Court of Appeal stated the
                    established sentencing range for offences under section 394 of the Penal Code
                    where death occurred, the court also noted at [14] that lower courts are not
                    required to adhere slavishly to sentencing precedents and that each case
                    ultimately turns on its own facts. Christopher did not participate in the
                    assault on the victim unlike the offenders in the precedents cited by the Court
                    of Appeal. He was also not intimately involved in the planning of the robbery.
                    In fact, he was just a follower of instructions. “Arsan was clearly the
                    mastermind behind the scenes instructing Bala the lieutenant who in turn
                    directed the periphery characters of Christopher and Daniel”. Christopher
                    received only $500 out of $10,600 worth of sales. His role was therefore a very
                    limited one and his culpability was significantly lower than that of all the
                    accused persons in the precedent cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Counsel for Christopher placed reliance on
                        <em>PP v Somrak Senkham and Another</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 172 (“<em>Somrak</em>”)
                    where the accused persons were sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment coupled
                    with the mandatory 24 strokes of the cane although “it is immediately
                    accepted that the [Court of Appeal] in <em>Hirris</em>
                    stated that <em>Somrak</em> should not be used as a
                    precedent for robbery cases involving death”. “However, the
                    unfortunate predicament is that <em>Somrak</em> bears some
                    similarity to the instant case” and was decided by the same trial judge
                    in <em>Hirris</em> and some of the precedent cases cited
                    therein. The prosecution did not appeal against sentence in <em>Somrak</em> which was also not an appropriate precedent in the
                        <em>Hirris</em> context where the respondents actively
                    participated in the assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The distillable variable in sentencing
                    participants in robberies involving death was therefore the level of significant
                    participation of each offender with special regard to the assault on the victims
                    who died. Here, Christopher’s participation was peripheral.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Arsan played a major role in the planning of
                    the robbery. He was “the main character who brought all the puppets
                    together and masterfully choreographed the robbery”. His sentence
                    represented the upper limit as there were aggravating factors. He was the one
                    who hatched the initial robbery plan with Ragu. He recruited Bala who in turn
                    recruited Daniel and Christopher. He admitted that he was the originator of the
                    idea to hit the victim till he became unconscious and unable to recognise the
                    robbers. He was careful not to dirty his hands in the actual robbery. He was
                    largely responsible for the disposal of the loot. This case was also not
                    Arsan’s first brush with the law. By contrast, Christopher’s role
                    was significantly smaller that Arsan’s and his sentence should be
                    correspondingly lower than the upper limit represented by Arsan’s
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It appears to me that it may not be necessary
                    to invoke section 34 for a charge falling within section 394 of the Penal Code.
                    Section 394 already imposes liability on those “<em>jointly concerned</em> in committing or attempting to commit such
                    robbery” even though they did not cause the hurt (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Under section 394, the imprisonment term has
                    to be between 5 and 20 years and the number of strokes of the cane has to be
                    between 12 and 24 (24 being the maximum allowed under section 229(1) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)). The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Hirris</em> made it clear that the established
                    sentencing range for robbery cases involving death was 12 to 20 years’
                    imprisonment. Understandably, the Court of Appeal did not deal with the issue of
                    the number of strokes as the minimum and the maximum in that case were both 24.
                    The Court of Appeal also stated specifically at [15] of <em>Hirris</em> that “<em>Somrak Senkham</em>
                    should not be used as a precedent for robbery cases involving
                    death”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the light of these pronouncements by the
                    Court of Appeal, the persistent attempts by counsel for Christopher to resurrect
                        <em>Somrak</em> can only be futile. If counsel was
                    suggesting that the Court of Appeal was in error in rejecting <em>Somrak</em>, it is certainly not within the province of the High
                    Court to so decide and depart from the clear ruling in <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In my view, the statement by the Court of
                    Appeal about <em>Somrak</em> was a carefully considered one
                    arrived at after a detailed analysis of the relevant cases. Since one of the
                    reasons for relying on <em>Somrak</em> is that it
                    “bears some similarity to the instant case” (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above), that makes the argument for rejecting
                    any suggestion that the sentence here should be similar to that in <em>Somrak</em> even stronger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I note that the respondents in <em>Hirris</em> did inflict some non-fatal punches and kicks to
                    the body of the victim there while Daniel and Christopher here left the vicious
                    assault entirely to Bala. It would be naïve to think that they had no idea
                    whatsoever that violence would be used by Bala. After all, part of the robbery
                    plan was to ensure that the victim would be unable to hinder or to identify
                    them. It was not as if the robbers had planned to blindfold or to drug the
                    victim to achieve their common objective. They knew that one of them had a
                    baseball bat and that the purpose of bringing it along was not for hitting a
                    ball in Changi coastal park that fateful morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Hirris</em>, it
                    was essentially a case of three thirsty men planning on the spur of the moment
                    to rob someone in order to purchase some liquor. In stark contrast, in the
                    present case, there was advance planning, entailing even a prior visit to and
                    survey of the scene for familiarisation (or a “recce” mission, in
                    military terms). On the day of the robbery, the whole operation was carried out
                    with almost military precision in the early morning. Steps were taken to ensure
                    that the confrontation with the victim would not be seen by passing drivers. The
                    place and the vehicles for the transfer of the cargo were all planned. The
                    targeted loot was a very valuable cargo worth more than S$1 million (see
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Christopher may have
                    received only $500 at the material time but it must be remembered that the bulk
                    of the cargo had not been disposed of yet by the robbers and their identities
                    were already exposed by the swift actions of the police. They therefore did not
                    have the opportunity to sell the entire loot and distribute all the money. The
                    trio in <em>Hirris</em> merely took a brown wallet
                    containing $50, an EZ-Link card, a POSB ATM card and some personal papers from
                    the hapless deceased there (see [5] in <em>Hirris</em>).
                    The robbery in this case was therefore a much more serious one compared to that
                    in <em>Hirris</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I accept that the Court of Appeal in this case
                    did not invoke section 397 of the Penal Code when substituting the charge for
                    Daniel and Christopher. As mentioned in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above, section 397 provides for mandatory additional punishment of not less than
                    12 strokes of the cane in cases where the offender is armed with or uses any
                    deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt or attempts to cause death or grievous
                    hurt to any person. Section 397 only adds mandatory caning without affecting any
                    imprisonment term. I therefore do not think the Court of Appeal’s
                    pronouncement in <em>Hirris</em> concerning the established
                    sentencing range was confined to cases involving section 397. In any case, the
                    result of the assault here is still a painful and cruel death for the
                    victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I agree with the prosecution’s
                    submissions set out above. In my opinion, 15 years’ imprisonment and 15
                    strokes of the cane would be appropriate punishment for the charge substituted
                    by the Court of Appeal. I sentenced both Daniel and Christopher to this
                    punishment accordingly, without trying to look for minute differences in their
                    roles in the robbery with a legal microscope. I sympathise with their financial
                    difficulties but committing robbery with hurt cannot be the solution and anyone
                    contemplating such easy and extreme ways out of hardship must be effectively
                    discouraged from acting on such thoughts. I disregarded Daniel’s previous
                    criminal record as it has no real bearing on this case. The imprisonment term
                    was backdated to 5 June 2006, the date of their arrest. If they are granted
                    a one-third remission in the imprisonment term, they should be released in about
                    5 years 8 months from the date they were sentenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Both Daniel and Christopher have appealed
                    against their sentences.</p>
