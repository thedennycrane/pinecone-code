<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1. This Registrar’s Appeal is against the order of an

Assistant Registrar given on 6 March 2002 dismissing the Plaintiff’s application for

leave to serve interrogatories on Rey Foo Jong Han, an advocate and solicitor in the law

firm of K S Chia Gurdeep &amp; Param. I allowed the Plaintiff’s appeal and made

certain consequential orders as to costs. I will refer to the interrogatories later.<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. Rey Foo Jong Han was the former solicitor of both the Plaintiff and

the Defendant. He was instructed by them in June or July 2000 to act for them in the sale

and purchase of 90 million shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd. He acted on their joint

instructions and was involved in the drafting and finalisation of the Sale and Purchase

Agreement for the said shares. Under the Agreement, the Plaintiff and the Defendant were

named as joint-purchasers of the 90 million shares from the vendors.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. In this action, the Plaintiff is claiming half the purchase price of

the first tranche of shares under the Agreement. He paid for the shares solely. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. In his Defence, the Defendant averred that there was a

"Precedent Agreement" between him, the Plaintiff and one Mr Ong Puay Koon

wherein they would each purchase one third of the 90 million shares. The Plaintiff denied

the existence of any "Precedent Agreement". He asserted that he had not given

Rey Foo any instructions on a Precedent Agreement and had not received any advice from his

former solicitor regarding such. Accordingly, the Plaintiff stated, the interrogatories

would be directly relevant to the Defence raised by the Defendant as they concerned the

probability of the existence of the alleged Precedent Agreement</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Further, if Rey Foo was aware of the existence of such a Precedent

Agreement from the instructions he received from the Defendant, he and his firm would be

potentially liable to the Plaintiff for failing to advise him on its repercussions on the

Sale and Purchase Agreement. The Plaintiff was advised by his present solicitors that an

inspection of the file maintained by M/s K S Chia Gurdeep &amp; Param on 21 February 2002

revealed no evidence of any Precedent Agreement or of advice on this subject.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The Plaintiff’s present solicitors sought the co-operation of

Rey Foo but he declined to reveal any information unless the Defendant waived solicitor

and client privilege. However, the Defendant was not willing to do so. In response to the

Plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 14 February 2002 asking for confirmation that

the Defendant had no objections to them interviewing Rey Foo and inspecting his file on

the transaction in question, the Defendant’s solicitors stated in their letter dated

24 February 2002 as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Both our clients instructed Mr Rey Foo of M/s K S Chia Gurdeep

  &amp; Param. As such your client is perfectly entitled to speak to his own solicitor, Mr

  Rey Foo. Your client is also perfectly entitled to review whatever documents that Mr Rey

  Foo has in his files, that he is entitled to under the usual solicitor-client

  relationship.</p>
<p align="justify">However, at this time, our client does not waive privilege in respect

  of any instructions/communications between himself and Mr Rey Foo. Your client may well

  wish to ascertain the relevance of the information he seeks from Mr Rey Foo, before

  considering further steps."</p>
</blockquote>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE APPLICATION</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Accordingly, the Plaintiff took out this application on 25 February

2002, by way of Summons for Further Directions, for the following orders:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1. That the Plaintiff be at liberty to serve on Mr Rey Foo Jong

  Han of M/s K S Chia Gurdeep &amp; Param interrogatories in writing as set out in a copy of

  which is attached hereto and that the said Mr Rey Foo Jong Han do answer the questions in

  writing by affidavit to be filed within twenty-eight (28) days after service of the Order

  to be made hereon and of the interrogatories ;</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Mr Rey Foo Jong Han be

  dispensed with and his evidence be given orally at the trial of this action.</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the costs of this application be paid by the Defendant to the

  Plaintiff."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The interrogatories were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"<u><b>INTERROGATORIES</b></u></p>
</blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">A. Origin of document</p>
</b><blockquote>
<b><p align="justify"></p></b>1. Look at the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 20 July 2000

    made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant of the one part and Lee Kim Tah Investments

    Pte Ltd, the estate of Lee Kim Tah deceased and Lee Kim Tah Foundation of the other part

    relating to the sale and purchase of 90,000,000 shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd. Were

    you the solicitor acting for the Plaintiff and the Defendant in the said transaction?

    <p align="justify">2. If the answer to the 1<sup>st</sup> interrogatory is yes, who

    presented the 1<sup>st</sup> draft of the said agreement?<b></b></p>
</blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">B. Instructions</p>
</b><blockquote>
<b><p align="justify"></p></b>3. Were you, at any time in the course of your retainer,

    informed by the Defendant that one-third of the said shares were to be purchased by a Mr

    Ong Puay Koon?

    <p align="justify">4. If the answer to the 3<sup>rd</sup> interrogatory is yes, </p>
<p align="justify">a. when and where was the information received?<b></b></p>
<p align="justify">b. why did you not name Mr Ong Puay Koon as a co-purchaser in the

    said Agreement?</p>
<p align="justify">c. did you, at any time, advise the Plaintiff on the repercussions of

    not naming Mr Ong Puay Koon as a co-purchaser in the said agreement?<b></b></p>
<p align="justify">5. If the answer to interrogatory 4(c) is no, why not?</p>
<p align="justify">6. If the answer to interrogatory 4(c) is yes, what was the nature of

    your advice and was it dispensed orally or in writing?<b></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, Rey Foo Jong Han, are required to answer all the above

  interrogatories within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of receipt of these

  interrogatories in writing by affidavit."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The Assistant Registrar granted an order in terms of prayer 2 of the

above application and dismissed prayer 1 as he was of the opinion that the interrogatories

would not serve the purpose of disposing of the issues at trial. He also made no order as

to costs.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE APPEAL</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Order 26A of the Rules of Court, which permits interrogatories to

be administered to a non-party, provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<b>Interrogatories against other person (O. 26A, r.1)</b></p>
<p align="justify">1. – (1) …</p>
<p align="justify">(2) An application after the commencement of proceedings for an order

  to administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party to the proceedings shall be

  made by summons, which must be served on that person personally and on every party to the

  proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) The summons under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be supported by an

  affidavit which must –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) in the case of a summons under paragraph (1), state the grounds for

    the application, the material facts pertaining to the intended proceedings and whether the

    person against whom the order is sought is likely to be party to subsequent proceedings in

    Court; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) in any case, specify the interrogatories to be administered and

    show, if practicable by reference to any pleading served or intended to be served in the

    proceedings that the answers to the interrogatories are relevant to an issue arising or

    likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in the proceedings or the

    identity of the likely parties to the proceedings, or both. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(4) A copy of the supporting affidavit shall be served with the summons

  on every person on whom the summons is required to be served.</p>
<p align="justify">(5) An order to administer interrogatories before the commencement of

  proceedings or to administer interrogatories to a person who is not a party to the

  proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying

  possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just

  to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.</p>
<b><p align="justify">Interrogatories to be ordered only if necessary (O. 26A, r. 2)</p>
</b><p align="justify">2. On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, the

  Court, if satisfied that interrogatories are not necessary, or not necessary at that stage

  of the cause or matter, may dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and

  shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that

  interrogatories are not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or

  for saving costs.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<b><p align="justify">Costs (O. 26A, r. 5)</p>
</b><p align="justify">5. Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made

  in accordance with this Order, the person against whom the order is sought shall be

  entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying with any order made thereon on

  an indemnity basis."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. I will deal first with the issue whether interrogatories ought to

be ordered. Rey Foo was not willing to provide an affidavit of evidence-in-chief before

the trial although he has consented to give oral testimony at the trial. His answers to

the interrogatories would clearly be crucial for an important issue in the proceedings

– the existence of the Precedent Agreement and, if there was one, the circumstances

in which it came about. The Plaintiff has therefore satisfied the requirement of relevance

specified in Order 26A rule 1 (3)(b). Further, Rey Foo’s evidence may assist the

Plaintiff in deciding whether to add him or his firm as a party to the proceedings, a

purpose allowed under rule 1 (5) of the same Order. I emphasize here that I do not imply

any wrongdoing on the part of Rey Foo or his firm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Rey Foo’s evidence would also clarify the above-mentioned

important issue before the trial. This would be beneficial to both parties as it would

help them prepare the case they have to meet and no one would be taken by surprise by the

solicitor’s evidence. The present solicitors would probably need to ask the trial

judge for time to take further instructions if Rey Foo were to proffer his evidence only

at the trial. This would be obviated if the interrogatories were answered before the

trial. The interrogatories should therefore result in a fair disposal of the action and

would save some costs for the parties, factors the court should take into consideration

pursuant to Order 26A rule 2. I therefore allowed the interrogatories to be administered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. I now come to the issue of solicitor-client privilege. This is

governed by Section 128 of the Evidence Act which is in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"128. – (1) No advocate or solicitor shall at any time be

  permitted, unless with his client’s express consent, to disclose any communication

  made to him in the course and for the purpose of his employment as such advocate or

  solicitor by or on behalf of his client, or to state the contents or condition of any

  document with which he has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of his

  professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him to his client in the

  course and for the purpose of such employment.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Nothing in this section shall protect from disclosure –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) any such communication made in furtherance of any illegal purpose;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) any fact observed by any advocate or solicitor in the course of his

    employment as such showing that any crime or fraud has been committed since the

    commencement of his employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(3) It is immaterial whether the attention of such advocate or

  solicitor was or was not directed to such fact by or on behalf of his client.</p>
<i><p align="justify">Explanation – The obligation stated in this section continues

  after the employment has ceased.</p></i>"

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were former clients of Rey Foo

in respect of the same matter. They employed him as their solicitor jointly. Rey

Foo’s obligation in the above section continues even though he has ceased to be their

solicitor. "Client" in this context would obviously mean both the Plaintiff and

the Defendant as "words in the singular include the plural" [Section 2(1)

Interpretation Act]. The privilege conferred by the Evidence Act is a joint privilege in

these circumstances. Rey Foo would be prohibited from disclosing any communication made by

one or both of them in the course of his employment as their solicitor unless <u>both</u>

of them expressly consent. However, the prohibition is against disclosure to third parties

– that is, anyone not within the solicitor-client relationship. The said Section 128

does not seek to regulate disclosure within that relationship. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Solicitors dealing with such clients would take instructions from

both of them jointly or from one of them by convention or by express instruction. They

would also write to such clients jointly on any matter falling within the scope of their

employment. It would therefore be highly artificial, and indeed an impossible task, for

the solicitor to have to distinguish between communication with client A and with client B

in respect of the same matter. This is not a case of vendor and purchaser instructing the

same solicitor where a distinction must be made between communication to the solicitor in

the character of one party’s own legal advisor and communication to him in the

adverse character of legal advisor for the other party [see <i>Perry v Smith</i> (1842) 9

M &amp; W 681].</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. There could therefore be no question of solicitor-client privilege

in the interrogatories in issue here.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

COSTS FOR THE NON-PARTY</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. The general rule as to costs in respect of the non-party is found

in Order 26A rule 5 (quoted above). The Plaintiff submitted that he should not be ordered

to pay the costs of Rey Foo here as there was "some measure of culpability" on

the part of Rey Foo. The Plaintiff referred to a letter dated 1 March 2002 from Rey

Foo’s firm to the Plaintiff’s solicitors which stated that the interrogatories

were not necessary or not necessary at that stage of the proceedings and that, in any

event, Rey Foo did not accept that there was no privilege attaching to the

interrogatories. The Plaintiff relied on a passage from Jeffrey Pinsler’s Civil

Practice in Singapore and Malaysia (2002) where, at paragraph 634, the author said, in

reference to Order 24 rule 6 (which deals with discovery against non-parties but which has

a similar provision on costs):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"However, there may be circumstances in which the court may vary

  this position by requiring the person to pay the costs in part or full. He may even be

  required to pay part or all of the applicant’s costs. For example, if he unreasonably

  refuses to comply with a justified request for the information or his unreasonable conduct

  has resulted in delay in obtaining the information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The author actually made much the same remarks in commenting on Order

26A rule 5 in his Singapore Court Practice (2001).</p>
<p xmlns="">18. While I did not quite understand why Rey Foo should take the stand that the

interrogatories were not necessary at that stage or at all, the crux of his difficulty was

that he was caught in a dispute between two erstwhile clients and was concerned about

breaching his obligation owed to both. I decided that the proper order to make was that

the Plaintiff would pay Rey Foo costs on an indemnity basis pursuant to Order 26A rule 5,

such costs to be agreed between themselves, and that such costs and the costs of the

application and of the appeal be costs in the cause.</p>
