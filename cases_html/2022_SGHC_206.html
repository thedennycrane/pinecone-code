It is important to note that, at this <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> stage, the plaintiff still bears the burden of demonstrating the three requirements discussed above at [61]. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 500 (“<span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications</span>”) at [72], this is considered fair and just because the court’s exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction over an overseas defendant is “an imposition on him … and there is no justice in adding to his troubles the further burden of proof”. At this stage, in the absence of abuse of process, the plaintiff may rely on a new cause of action and/or additional O 11 r 1 heads of jurisdiction that was not included in the <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span> application, without the need to file a fresh originating process in respect of the same (see the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">NML</span><span class="font-italic"> Capital Ltd v Republic of Argentina </span>[2011] 2 AC 495 at [74]–[75] as well as the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen SE and another v MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another</span> [2018] SGHC 123 (“<span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span>”) at [184]–[189]). But given that the burden is on the plaintiff, the onus falls on the plaintiff to raise such new causes of action or grounds. Furthermore, at the <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes </span>stage, the court can consider subsequent developments that are relevant to the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> analysis and which occurred after the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> leave to serve out of Singapore was granted (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MAN</span><span class="font-italic"> Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another v IM Skaugen SE and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 327 (“<span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (CA)</span>”) at [50]–[55]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the tort choice of law rules apply</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Apart from the general observations above, I must also answer a specific question in relation to the plaintiff’s claims in tort. This concerns the logically anterior question of whether the tort choice of law rules (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the double actionability rule in Singapore)<span class="font-italic"> </span>factors into the analysis for whether leave should be granted for service outside of jurisdiction. The double actionability rule has been described as such (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [88]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The choice of law rule that Singapore courts apply for torts is the double actionability rule (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> ([63] supra) at [53]). The double actionability rule provides that the tort must be actionable under both the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span> and the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. Exceptionally, the double actionability rule may be displaced such that the tort may be actionable in Singapore even though it is not actionable under either the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> or the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span>. The exception may even be applied to provide that the law of a third country is the applicable law for the tort (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The first defendant and third defendant had taken opposing views in their submissions, with the first defendant arguing that the double actionability rule being irrelevant in relation to the present proceedings, while the third defendant asserting that it should be applied (see above at [46] and [55]). But what is in common to both the first and third defendants is that they dispute the applicability of the double actionability rule only within the sub-requirement of whether Singapore is the natural forum for the trial of the action (the “Natural Forum Stage”), and not whether there is a good arguable case that the claim comes within one of the heads of jurisdiction under O 11 r 1 of the ROC (the “Jurisdictional Gateway Stage”) (see above for the three sub-requirements at [61]). At the oral hearing before me, Mr Wee Xunji (“Mr Wee”) for the plaintiff accepted that the double actionability rule should apply, contrary to the first defendant’s position.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The parties’ differing submissions therefore compelled me to consider this issue carefully. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, being mindful of the scope of the parties’ submissions, I limit my substantive comments to only the applicability of the double actionability rule at the Natural Forum Stage. However, quite inevitably, my discussion of the applicability of the double actionability rule at the Natural Forum Stage will also touch on its application at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I start with a survey of the relevant cases. Here, there are High Court authorities in Singapore that seemingly point in both directions. In <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span>, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J opined that the double actionability rule is relevant for service out of jurisdiction applications. More specifically, Coomaraswamy J held that if the tort was committed in a foreign jurisdiction, the court must take the further step of analysing whether the tort satisfies the double actionability rule, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “that it is actionable both under the law of the jurisdiction in which the tort was committed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>, and also under the substantive law of the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span>” (at [82]), thereby finding the double actionability rule applicable at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage. This is because the plaintiff cannot establish a good arguable case in tort if it cannot establish a good arguable case that it satisfies the double actionability rule (at [85]), and that would be the end of the inquiry. Further, the double actionability rule was also found to be relevant in determining the governing law of the tortious claim (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>) as part of inquiry at the Natural Forum Stage (at [210]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Separately, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst Pte Ltd v PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Trans-Pacific Petrochemical Indotama and another </span>[2018] SGHC 126 (“<span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span>”), Audrey Lim JC observed that the double actionability rule is irrelevant for service out of jurisdiction applications. This is because the “rule is conceptually distinct from the question of whether Singapore is the proper forum … [and] is not intended to assist the court in locating the proper forum; the object of the rule is one of fairness” (at [60]). Indeed, Lim JC had rejected the plaintiff’s reliance on the double actionability rule in that case as it had made the misplaced argument that the rule refers to Singapore law and thus the natural forum is Singapore. This was misplaced because, as Lim JC, with respect, rightly points out, the double actionability rule refers partially to the law of the forum. That, in and of itself, certainly cannot point to Singapore as the natural forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 But more broadly, the applicability of the double actionability rule considered in <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span> related to the Natural Forum Stage (at [55]), instead of at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage (as was done in <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span> at [82]). This tracks more closely to disagreement that the first defendant and third defendant have on the double actionability rule in the present case (see above at [65]). For completeness, <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span> was a case dealing with O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of the ROC only (at [50]), while <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span> dealt with both limbs of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) and O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) (though it was found that the double actionability rule was relevant to both limbs at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 <span class="font-italic">IM Skaugen (HC)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span> therefore differ in two ways: (a) the <span class="font-italic">general </span>applicability of the double actionability rule for service out of jurisdiction applications, and (b) the <span class="font-italic">specific</span> stage at which to consider the potential applicability of the double actionability rule (whether at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage, the Natural Forum Stage, or both). Technically, should the double actionability rule be relevant to the issue of whether leave ought to be granted for service out of jurisdiction, then it would permeate <span class="font-italic">both</span> the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage <span class="font-italic">and </span>the Natural Forum Stage, albeit for different purposes. It is relevant at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage as the non-justiciability of the tort in Singapore means that there is no good arguable case that the claim falls within O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) or O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of the ROC (unless the flexible exception to the rule were to apply), whereas it is relevant at the Natural Forum Stage as a finding that the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti </span>is foreign law might point away from Singapore being the natural forum for trial. Nevertheless, the overall question remains the same: is the double actionability rule relevant for determining if leave should be granted for service out of jurisdiction applications?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The apparent deadlock between the two High Court authorities has yet to be broken, though it appears that the general position in <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span> has been favoured in some High Court Registry decisions (see, for example, the decision of <span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd v Tong Chi Ho and others</span> [2022] SGHCR 8 at [33(a)], again only in relation to the Natural Forum Stage). On the other hand, it appears that some academic authorities take the view that the Singapore tort choice of law rules do apply at Jurisdictional Gateway Stage (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 11/1/30), citing <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span> without criticism. Thus, <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> – Conflict of Laws</span> Vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws</span>”) states the following at para 75.054: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has been held [in <span class="font-italic">IM </span><span class="font-italic">Skaugen (HC)</span>] that Singapore choice of law rules applies to determine whether a justiciable tort is made out under Order 11 rule 1(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>). It should follow that whether the plaintiff’s claim is in ‘tort’ raises a characterisation question for choice of law … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In considering the approach in Singapore, it is useful to consider the position taken in England. In England, a predecessor rule in Ord 11 r 1(1)(f) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (SI 1965 No 776) (UK) required that the claim be “founded on a tort”. This has been interpreted to require that there be an actual tort ascertained by reference to rules of English law including its rules on the conflict of laws (see Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">The Conflict of Laws</span> (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2019) at pp 112–113; see also, <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws</span> vol 1 (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 11-215). In this connection, in <span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc</span> [1990] 1 QB 391, the English Court of Appeal (at p 446) opined that the double actionability rule as laid down by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Boys v Chaplin</span> [1971] AC 356 was indeed relevant to the analysis of whether a claim comes under the tort jurisdictional gateway in Ord 11 r 1(1)(f) (except where the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> was already found to be in England).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Treading water in this sea of myriad views, what I have found helpful was to refer to the commentary made in another academic article. The learned authors acknowledged that the identification of the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> and application of the double actionability rule in <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span> might have been unnecessary, whilst also recognising that it may be sensible to apply it in any event (see Joel Lee &amp; Joel Leow, “Conflict of Laws” (2018) 19 SAL Ann Rev 273 at 283):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.32 … First, it is <span class="font-italic">interesting that the court felt</span>, in the face of a possible foreign tort, <span class="font-italic">that it had to embark on</span> the substance of the tort test and <span class="font-italic">the accompanying double actionability analysis before considering the two limbs of O</span><span class="font-italic"> 11 r 1(f)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.33 It is <span class="font-italic">possible to argue that this is unnecessary</span>. The <span class="font-italic">language of O</span><span class="font-italic"> 11 r 1(f) does not technically require</span> the identification of the location of the tort. Order 11 r 1(f)(i) provides for service out where “the claim is founded on a tort, wherever committed, which is constituted, at least in part, by an act or omission occurring in Singapore”. Order 11 r 1(f)(ii) provides for service out where “the claim is wholly or partly founded on, or is for the recovery of damages in respect of, damage suffered in Singapore caused by a tortious act or omission wherever occurring”. <span class="font-italic">On the face of it, both limbs appear agnostic</span> about needing to identify the location of the tort.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.35 <span class="font-italic">Having said that</span> (and putting aside the conceptual criticism that applying the double-actionability rule is to essentially import a choice of law rule into a jurisdictional question), from a <span class="font-italic">practical perspective</span>, it may be sensible for the court to identify the location of the tort <span class="font-italic">and apply the double-actionability rule now rather than to let the matter pass through at the jurisdictional stage only to fail the double-actionability rule at trial</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I can see the force in applying the double actionability rule at the jurisdictional stage as it will weed out claims which might eventually fail at trial. There would be savings of time and costs. The flipside of this, however, is that there is nothing in the text of O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the ROC which mandates identifying the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> which accompanies the double actionability rule analysis. Another concern might be that at the jurisdictional stage, this might require substantial expert evidence on foreign law to be produced at an early stage to determine whether the tort in question is also actionable abroad (should the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> be foreign law). Indeed, it is apposite to note at this juncture that in the present case, there has not been any submissions made whatsoever on the actionability of the tort in a foreign jurisdiction, and no expert evidence on foreign law has been produced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my respectful view, the broad approach in <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span>, that the double actionability rule is applicable to service out of jurisdiction applications,<span class="font-italic"> </span>should be followed. Apart from the reasons of economy mentioned above, I note that the location of the place of the tort is useful in aiding the court to locate the natural forum for the dispute. It is trite that the place where the tort is committed has residual relevance at the jurisdictional stage as a good indication of the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>natural forum: “for tort claims, the place of the tort is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum” unless it was merely fortuitous (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [106]). This means that the court will ordinarily have to identify the location of the tort in any case in assessing whether it is the natural forum for the dispute. In fact, while Lim JC declined to apply the double actionability rule at the Natural Forum Stage in <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span>, regardless, she conducted the necessary pre-requisite exercise of locating the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> when noting that the place of the tort is <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie</span> the natural forum for the trial (at [55]–[58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In so concluding, I must emphasise that I express my views mainly in relation to the relevance of the double actionability rule at the Natural Forum Stage, since this is where the first defendant and third defendant, as well as the plaintiff, have differed in their submissions. Hence, I say no more about this point in so far as it concerns the application of the double actionability rule at the Jurisdictional Gateway Stage, and I only return to mentioning the double actionability rule below at [116]–[122].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff has established a good arguable case that her claim falls within one of the specified grounds of O 11 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 With the above discussion in mind, I turn to consider the first requirement for leave to serve out of jurisdiction, which is that the plaintiff must establish a good arguable case that her claim falls within one of the specified grounds of O 11 of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In considering these three heads of jurisdiction relied on by the plaintiff, I consider that the “arguable case” standard in O 11 of the ROC requires the plaintiff to have “the better of the argument”, which is more than “a mere <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, but is different from the standard of a balance of probabilities given the limits inherent in the stage at which the application is being heard” (see the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span><span class="font-italic"> Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1271 (“<span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span><span class="font-italic"> Overseas</span>”) at [45] and <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> at [49]). In this regard the court may grapple with questions of law but should not delve into contested factual issues (see <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span><span class="font-italic"> Overseas</span> at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Initially, as highlighted by the first defendant and third defendant (see [47] and [51] above), respectively, none of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff in support of Summons 3823 identified the relevant grounds under O 11 of the ROC that the plaintiff was relying on. It was only after a Registrar’s Direction dated 16 November 2021 under HC/SUM 5024/2021 was issued that the plaintiff’s solicitors filed an affidavit on 29 November 2021 identifying O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and/or O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">o</span>) of the ROC as the heads of jurisdiction that Suit 692 fell within. These remain the only grounds raised by the plaintiff. Mr Wee confirmed that he was only relying on these heads of jurisdiction.

</div>
</div> Given that the burden remains on the plaintiff to demonstrate the three requirements for leave to serve out of jurisdiction, including the relevant head of jurisdiction, I will confine my consideration to these heads only.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Claim in tort: Act or omission occurring in the jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The first head of jurisdiction which the plaintiff relies on is that in O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) of the ROC, which states, “the claim is founded on a tort, wherever committed, which is constituted, at least in part, by an act or omission occurring in Singapore”. It is not necessary to demonstrate that every element of the tort was established in Singapore. Instead, it is sufficient to show that at least an act or omission occurred in Singapore, and that the cause of action in tort is founded at least in part on such act or omission (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws</span> at para 75.050).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The plaintiff’s cause of action in tort</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is unclear from the SOC, which had focused on the third defendant’s breach of its fiduciary duties and/or trust to the plaintiff, what the exact cause of action in tort is supposed to be. Perhaps, the best hint of this is at paragraph 20 of the SOC, which states that “the [defendants] had conspired to injure the [p]laintiff by depriving her of her share of the Share Proceeds”. Further, at paragraph 21, the SOC provides that “[i]n furtherance of the conspiracy, the [defendants] and/or their agents and/or representatives opened [the] OCBC Bank [A]ccount for the Sales Proceeds to then be unlawfully transferred into”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The clearest intimation of the tortious cause of action that the plaintiff relies on is found in the plaintiff’s written submissions, where the plaintiff appears to rely on both lawful means conspiracy and unlawful means conspiracy. The plaintiff argues that there was a predominant purpose of opening the OCBC account to deprive her of the WWC sales proceeds, or that the way the OCBC account was opened was unlawful as it was procured by deceit. At the oral hearing before me, Mr Wee submitted that the plaintiff was relying primarily on unlawful means conspiracy as the plaintiff alleged that the opening of the OCBC Bank Account was an unlawful act due to certain false declarations being made.

</div> The plaintiff asserts that the monies must have come from the accounts opened in Singapore that received and dealt with the Sale Proceeds. But this says nothing about the OCBC Bank Account in Singapore. Also, an examination of the Bank of America account statements that were exhibited do not show monies being deposited from accounts based in Singapore. Indeed, Mr Wee could not point me to any documentary evidence or reference indicating so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Moreover, the plaintiff has not alleged any facts to show how the third defendant could have known of any facts that would have affected its conscience.

In other words, there must be a substantial question of fact or law that the plaintiff has a genuine desire to be tried. This is a lower standard of proof than a “good arguable case” (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas </span><span class="font-italic">Electrolok Ltd and another v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd and others</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156 at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Given my conclusion earlier in relation to O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">o</span>) of the ROC, all of which are concerned with the merits of the claim, I likewise conclude that the plaintiff has not shown a serious issue to be tried on the merits. This is all the more so since in examining the requirements for service out of jurisdiction, a court is not to consider them in isolation but must consider whether its findings in relation to one requirement is consistent with its findings in relation to the other requirements (see <span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Singapore is the natural forum</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevant law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I turn then to the last requirement, which is whether Singapore is the natural forum to hear the case. In this regard, Singapore law applies the common law principles of <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> allocation of jurisdiction enunciated in the leading UK House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 460, also commonly referred to as the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. The <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test entails a two-stage evaluation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 At the first stage, the court considers general connecting factors to identify the forum with the most real and substantial connection with the dispute (“Stage One”). The connecting factors include personal connections, connections to events and transactions, governing law, other proceedings, and the shape of the litigation. In <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> Tania</span>”), the Court of Appeal reiterated that Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is not a mechanistic exercise concerned only with the quantity of connecting factors pointing to the competing fora; the quality of connecting factors is crucial. As the Court of Appeal explained (at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Parties in modern commercial litigation are often well connected, with relational and business ties to many different jurisdictions. The task of the court in this context is not to draw up a balance sheet of tenuous or insubstantial points of contact with different fora in the expectation that the jurisdiction with the largest number on its side prevails at the close of the analysis. Rather, the search is for those incidences (or connections) that have the <span class="font-italic">most relevant and substantial associations</span> with the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It is conventional to group the connecting factors into the five categories of personal connections, connections to events and transactions, governing law, other proceedings, and shape of the litigation (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 At the second stage, the court considers primarily if substantial justice may be obtained in the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> natural forum (“Stage Two”). All factors will be examined, and the court is to balance between justice to the parties and considerations of international comity. Whilst the two stages are analysed separately and sequentially, some aspects of the case may be analysed at either Stage One or Stage Two. Importantly, the court is to bear in mind that the aim of the whole exercise is to determine whether the case should be heard in the jurisdiction which is more suitable for the interests of the parties and the ends of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> Tania </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[72]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Applying these principles to the present case, I am of the view that Singapore is not the natural forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In relation to Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test, most of the connecting factors point to the US courts as the natural forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Personal connections and location of witnesses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 First, it is undisputed that none of the parties in Suit 692 have any connection with Singapore.

Another equally important, if not more important consideration, is the compellability of key witnesses who reside abroad (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23] and [25]). This is because a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in Singapore Proceedings (see O 38 r 18(2) of the ROC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Mr Wee argued before me that it was important for the trial to take place in Singapore because of the issue relating to the OCBC Bank Account, where the bank’s employees would have to be cross-examined on how the account was opened (in relation to the tort of conspiracy). The plaintiff asserts that this rationale applies equally to need to hear the testimonies of the Goldman Sachs employees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 However, the plaintiff has eluded the point that the crux of the analysis centres around the <span class="font-italic">key witnesses</span> to the dispute. Those key witnesses consist primarily of the plaintiff, the first defendant, the second defendant and the parties involved in the sale of WCC to Goldwind – all of whom either reside in the US or China. These are the persons who can give evidence as to the circumstances of the sale which the plaintiff has alleged as improper. In contradistinction, any testimony from the employees of OCBC and Goldman Sachs, while somewhat relevant, would only be peripheral to the main dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In conducting the analysis, the court’s focus should not lie mainly on the evidence the plaintiff needs to establish its allegations since it is the plaintiff who wishes to pursue the claims in Singapore, and the court must instead also consider the potential prejudice to the defendants in running their defence (see, in the context of a stay, <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span><span class="font-italic">Bidzina </span>at [86]). Thus, the fact that the plaintiff claims that she requires the testimony from the employees of OCBC and Goldman Sachs to establish her claim should be given less weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In totality, the personal connections of the parties and locations of relevant witnesses point away from Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Governing law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In general, at the interlocutory stage and before all the evidence is taken, I am entitled to decide the present Summonses based on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> view on the governing law (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Yeoh </span><span class="font-italic">Poh San and another v Won Siok Wan</span> [2002] SGHC 196 at [15]). The basic premise behind the governing law as a connecting factor is that it is generally preferable for an action to be tried in the jurisdiction whose law would apply to it (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [42]). The Singapore courts have taken notice, at least for jurisdictional purposes, that the contents of foreign law may differ from the law of the forum even in the absence of proof (see the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”) at [57]; <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [96] as well as the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Multi-Code Electronics Industries</span><span class="font-italic"> (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000 at [49]–[50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The governing law is a significant factor in Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. This flows from the argument that in general, the court which will be called on to apply its own law is in a better position to do so for many reasons (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws </span>at para 75.093). It is naturally most familiar with its own law and least likely to get it wrong; it will be able to determine the contents of the applicable at least cost and expense; and it will not have to deal with conflicting expert witnesses on foreign law and translations of foreign law from foreign languages since a foreign court will be more adept in dealing with its own law than Singapore courts, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. The importance of the governing law may be calibrated downwards where the issues at play are mostly issues of fact or whether the foreign law is not that different from Singapore law. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil</span>, the governing law being BVI was given little weight since it was also a common law jurisdiction and because the key issues in dispute were factual in nature (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the present case, the issues at play are a mix of factual and legal issues as the factual basis underlying the tortious and equitable claims must be ascertained, but so too must the legal principles on establishing each legal requirement. The case at hand also deals potentially with Chinese law which is a civil law jurisdiction, and this court (or even the Singapore International Commercial Court) would be less familiar to deal with that aspect (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sinco</span><span class="font-italic"> Technologies Pte Ltd v Singapore Chi Cheng Pte Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHC 234 at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In relation to the conspiracy claim, I have found above that the double actionability rule is relevant to identify the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> (see above at [74]). I must first identify the place of the tort. To do this, I apply the “substance test” which requires the court to “look at the events constituting the tort and ask where, in substance, the cause of action arose” (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [90] and <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (HC)</span> at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The application of the “substance test” to the tort of conspiracy is not as straightforward as there may be “many points of contact” (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws</span> at para 75.378). The key factors to consider for the tort of conspiracy include the “identity, importance and location of the conspirators, the locations where any agreements or combinations took place, the nature and places of the concerted acts or means, the location of the plaintiff and the places where the plaintiff suffered losses” (see <span class="font-italic">EFT</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings</span> at [53] and the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Wing </span><span class="font-italic">Hak Man and another v Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and others</span> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 446 at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Both alleged conspirators here have no connection to Singapore. The first defendant is a US citizen resident in the US, while the second defendant is an Antiguan citizen (see [7] above) (for completeness, the third defendant is a BVI-incorporated company, though no arguments on attribution of knowledge was made by the plaintiff). As the alleged conspirators were located abroad, it naturally follows that any agreement forming the alleged conspiracy would have taken place outside of Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst</span> at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The place where the plaintiff would have suffered losses would also likely be in the US and not Singapore as that was where she was resident and where the monies from the proceeds should have gone into (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, her US bank accounts). As the loss here was framed as the plaintiff not receiving her share of the sale proceeds, the place of damage would be the location of her bank accounts, presumably in the US. As an aside, as noted in <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (CA) </span>at [78] (a case concerning corporate entities), in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it can be assumed that the damage for the claim “is suffered in the jurisdiction where the relevant entity is incorporated”. There is no such default rule for natural persons, and I say no more about this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Additionally, the place where the acts of the alleged conspiracy took place was not in Singapore. The plaintiff pleaded that the defendants had conspired to injury the plaintiff by depriving her of her share of sale proceeds. These acts included: (a) the first defendant not issuing any share certificates to her whilst representing to her that she owned 45% of WWC due to her investment, (b) the defendants conspiring to allow the third defendant to take over the entire shareholding of WWC, and (c) the defendants orchestrating to sell WWC to Goldwind for US$100m in 2017 without notifying the plaintiff.

</div> However, these pleaded acts point to locations outside Singapore. For example, the sale of WWC to Goldwind would have taken place in Hong Kong as Goldwind is in and incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong SAR, and that was where the due diligence and contract negotiation took place for the sale. The sale contract itself was executed in Hong Kong.

</div> However, Mr Wee argued instead that the material part of the conspiracy relates to the coming to Singapore by the first and second defendants to further the conspiracy and the dissipation of sale proceeds in Singapore by opening the OCBC Bank Account. The problem with this submission is that there is little evidential basis (if at all) that this actually occurred, which I have already addressed above at [83]–[85]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Applying the “substance test”, the place of the tort is either in the US or China. Without having to pinpoint the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> definitively, what is at least clear is that Singapore law is not the governing law for the tort claim and this factor points away from Singapore being the natural forum for the dispute. Further, in addition to the fact that the governing law is a foreign law, it is trite that the place of the tort is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for trial unless it is merely fortuitous (see above at [74]), and this is a “weighty factor pointing in favour of that jurisdiction” (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> at [40]). The place of tort being abroad is not fortuitous here and is unsurprising given that substantially all the relevant events and parties do not have any connections with Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Turning next to the breach of fiduciary duty or breach of trust claim, despite the lack of clarity in her pleaded case, the gravamen of the plaintiff’s complaint here essentially centres on her alleged beneficial interest in the shares (which were then sold for the share proceeds). Any claim in the monies in the OCBC Bank Account thereafter (if this is even true), is merely part of the traceable proceeds flowing from the property rights in the shares. Thus, the law governing the equitable ownership of the shares, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the law of incorporation of the company, is likely to be the relevant choice of law rule here (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws </span>at para 75.324, citing the English Court of Appeal decision of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investments plc (No 3)</span> [1987] 1 WLR 387 and the English High Court decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Re Harvard Securities Ltd</span> [1997] 2 BCLC 369). The governing law would be Samoan law as WWC was incorporated under the laws of Samoa. Mr Wee did not seriously dispute this point in oral submissions and accepted that the issue of ownership of the shares should be dealt with by Samoan law. Again, the governing law for this part of the claim points away from Singapore being the natural forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Connections to events and transactions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As to connections to events and transactions, the premise behind this category is that it is assumed that evidence would typically be found where these events or transactions occur. This allows the trial to be held at the place with the least expense and inconvenience (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Best Soar Ltd v Praxis Energy Agents Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 3 SLR 423 at [19]). Thus, in so far as torts are concerned, the place where the tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for the tort claim (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]–[40]), and this is a weighty though not decisive factor, unless it is shown that the place of the tort was merely fortuitous (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [106]–[107]). This presumption can be displaced when necessary, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where the tortious claim is parasitic on other non-tortious claims to be determined in a different fora (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI de CV and others and another appeal (Jesus Angel Guerra Mendez, non-party)</span> [2020] 1 SLR 226 (“<span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span>”) at [90]–[91]). In this regard, as I have already found above at [122], applying the “substance test” in relation to the conspiracy claim, the place of tort is either in the US or China. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Conversely, in relation to the plaintiff’s case on breach of fiduciary duties/trust, the breach would have occurred on the alleged opening of the OCBC Bank Account in Singapore and the deposit of monies within. However, I give little weight to this factor ultimately given my conclusions in relation to the merits of the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Related proceedings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The presence of related proceedings is relevant to the natural forum analysis where there is a risk of inconsistent findings or judgments if overlapping proceedings take place in multiple jurisdictions. The weight to be given to this factor will depend on how far along the related proceedings have been advanced (see <span class="font-italic">IM</span><span class="font-italic"> Skaugen (CA)</span> at [154] and <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil</span> at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In my view, there is a high degree of overlap between the US Proceedings and Suit 692. Not only are the parties identical in the 2020 Complaint and Suit 692, the relevant background facts underlying both proceedings are similar. While the pleadings in the US Proceedings do not explicitly refer to a cause of action in the tort of conspiracy as such, as Mr Poon and Mr Tay helpfully brought me through, there were references littered throughout relating to conspiracy such as: alleging that the defendants were “co-conspirators” and that “pursuant to [the first defendant’s] conspiracy with [the second defendant] and [the third defendant], [the first defendant] acted tortiously in California”.

More broadly,</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Professor Yeo points out that “the modern global trend in common law systems is to enlarge the scope of extraterritorial jurisdiction, subject to control by the natural forum doctrine”, and any asymmetric application of the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Spiliada</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> test would thus require justification beyond mere procedural constraints.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 However, even if I accept that Stage Two applies in the present circumstances, the plaintiff has not shown why substantial injustice would be occasioned to her if the action were to be tried abroad. In any event, the court must proceed cautiously before it pronounces that a litigant will experience a deprivation of substantial justice if left to seek recourse in an appropriate foreign forum (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Good Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 at [27]). This is particularly so where the foreign forum operates a well-established and well-recognised system of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> Tania</span> at [110]), in line with the principle of international comity. Here, even if there was a suggestion made by the plaintiff that the US or China courts will be unable to try the dispute in a manner which is fair, what can be observed is that these two jurisdictions operate well-established and well-recognised courts of justice which should not be lightly impugned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For all these reasons, I agree with the defendants that Singapore is not the natural forum. Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff has not discharged the burden of demonstrating the three requirements to serve out of jurisdiction. It follows that I set aside the Service Out Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Given my conclusion, I need not consider if the plaintiff had made full and frank disclosure at the <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte </span>application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Writ was validly served</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Likewise, I also do not need to consider if the Writ was validly served on the first and third defendants, even as I note that both parties have adduced conflicting expert opinion in favour of their respective cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For all these reasons, I set aside the Service Out Order contained in ORC 4728. It therefore follows that the Mareva injunction in ORC 4728 is similarly of no effect since the High Court’s power to grant the injunction is conditional upon the court having <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> jurisdiction over the foreign defendant in the first place (apart from the plaintiff having a reasonable accrued cause of action in Singapore) (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bi </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaoqiong (in her personal capacity and as trustees of Xiao Qiong Bi Trust and the Alisa Wu Irrevocable Trust) v China Medical Technologies, Inc (in liquidation) and another</span> [2019] 2 SLR 595 at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I am grateful to all parties, especially Mr Poon and Mr Tay, and their respective teams who did not address me, for their helpful oral and written submissions.
