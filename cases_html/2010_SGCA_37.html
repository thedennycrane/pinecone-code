<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the appeal by Ong Pang Siew (“the
                    appellant”) against conviction for the murder of his step-daughter
                    (“the deceased”) pursuant to s 302 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). The charge
                    against him states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">That you, ONG PANG SIEW,</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on the 20th day of October 2007 between 10.00 p.m. and
                        10.30 p.m. at Block 24 Marsiling Drive #08-175, Singapore, did commit
                        murder by causing the death of one Ong Pan Hui, and you have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code,
                        Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dramatis personae</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant has worked as a bus driver for
                    more than 20 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> At the material time, his employer was
                    M/s Loh Gim Chong Transport (“M/s Loh”) whom he had
                    worked for about seven months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Before his employment with M/s Loh, the
                    appellant worked at three different transport companies for periods of 11 years,
                    six years and one year respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He left the first company when it
                    ceased operating but there is no evidence on record explaining why he left the
                    other two companies within the space of a year. The appellant is the former
                    husband of the deceased’s mother, Xiu Yanhong (“Xiu”). Both
                    the deceased, who was 15 years old in 2007, and Xiu were formerly Chinese
                    nationals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant met Xiu in 1997 while she was
                    employed as an electronic production operator in a factory. He was then
                    providing transportation for the factory’s workers. When the factory
                    closed down in 1998, Xiu found work in another factory. They continued to
                    maintain contact and later developed a close relationship. When Xiu fell ill
                    sometime in 1999, the appellant helped her during her convalescence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> After her work permit expired in November
                    1999, she returned to China but remained in touch with the appellant.
                    Eventually, she divorced the deceased’s biological father sometime in
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After her divorce, Xiu ran into serious
                    financial difficulties and sought assistance from the appellant. He responded by
                    visiting her in China. Once there, he rented an apartment for her and provided
                    her with money from his savings to tide her over.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Their relationship blossomed and she
                    accepted his proposal for marriage. Following his return to Singapore, the
                    appellant immediately made arrangements for Xiu to return to Singapore which she
                    did in 2002. They married soon thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After Xiu obtained her Permanent Resident status
                    in late 2002, she persuaded the appellant to arrange for the deceased to
                    continue her education in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In November 2002, the deceased arrived in
                    Singapore and subsequently adopted the appellant’s surname, changing her
                    name from “Pan Hui” to “Ong Pan Hui”. Xiu affirmed
                    that the appellant’s relationship with the deceased was initially good and
                    he doted on the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 8 August 2003, Xiu gave birth to their
                    son, GHK (“GHK”). Unfortunately, the relationship between the
                    appellant and Xiu deteriorated rapidly, soon after. Xiu had begun working as a
                    masseuse. Subsequently, Xiu worked at three different massage parlours between
                    2003 and 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Because the
                    appellant was unhappy with the nature of her work, he and Xiu had frequent
                    quarrels. In turn, she complained about his gambling habits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The
                    appellant also heard from his neighbours that different men were sending Xiu
                    home and that Xiu had become “very sexy”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In 2005, Xiu
                    had two miscarriages. Following this, the appellant accused Xiu of having
                    affairs with other men in the course of her work as a masseuse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This further damaged their relationship.
                    Xiu, for her part, insisted on continuing with the same line of work. She
                    claimed the additional income was needed to support her parents in
                        China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In January 2006, Xiu started her own massage
                    parlour, employing her savings as well as loans from her friends. Despite his
                    continuing and profound misgivings, the appellant also contributed about $2,000
                    to the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Xiu operated the business without a
                    permit and was fined twice before she terminated it. At around the same time,
                    Xiu’s previous employer offered to sell her business to Xiu. She accepted
                    this offer. The appellant contributed about $5,000 to this
                        enterprise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Xiu subsequently spent even more time at
                    work as she attempted to grow the business. As a result of their long working
                    hours and loss of trust, the relationship between the appellant and Xiu
                    inexorably broke down. Xiu testified that “sometimes his temperament was
                    good, but sometimes it was bad.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span><em>However, she also affirmed that the appellant had never been
                        violent and would never “lay a hand” on
                        her</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The divorce proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in March 2007, the appellant and Xiu
                    had a heated argument because the appellant insisted that Xiu should stop
                    working as a masseuse. More bitter recriminations followed and on 1 April
                    2007, Xiu moved out of the matrimonial home to a rented flat
                    (“Xiu’s flat”) with the deceased and GHK. It was also around
                    this time that the appellant started working for M/s Loh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 15 May 2007, Xiu initiated divorce
                    proceedings citing unreasonable behaviour on the part of the
                        appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Statement of Particulars
                    for the divorce alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that after
                    the marriage the appellant was easily irritated and often lost his temper.
                    Further, it was asserted that in November 2005, the appellant made Xiu and the
                    children leave the matrimonial home after Xiu took a lift home from a male
                    customer late at night. He allegedly only allowed them to return home three
                    months later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The appellant, who had no
                    legal representation, did not contest the divorce proceedings. In early October
                    2007, Xiu obtained sole custody of the deceased. She was also granted sole care
                    and control of GHK while the appellant was granted access to GHK from 9.00am on
                    Saturdays to 9.00pm on Sundays.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Xiu, in the meantime, secured her Singapore
                    citizenship in August 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After the divorce, the appellant and Xiu
                    agreed that she would send GHK to City Hall MRT station every Saturday between
                    11.00am to 12.00 noon where she would hand care and control of GHK to him. The
                    appellant would then send GHK back to Xiu on Sunday nights.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This arrangement soon led to further
                    friction. The appellant stated in his police statement (and testified) that Xiu
                    often did not allow him to have access to GHK by making up excuses at the last
                        moment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Xiu, however, denied this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s activities on the day of the incident</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 20 October 2007, the appellant was
                    entitled to have access to GHK as it was a Saturday. However, after working late
                    into Friday night, he woke up at about 10.30am. As he did not have any driving
                    assignment that day, he went for coffee at the market near his place until about
                    12.00 noon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> After that, he went home to attend to his
                        laundry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> At about 1.00pm, a friend invited him for a
                    drink. He arrived at the coffee-shop at about 3.25pm. Together with four of his
                    friends, the appellant stayed at the coffee-shop until about 9.00pm. During this
                    period, they drank more than 20 bottles of beer, with the appellant consuming
                    the most with another friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After the appellant left the coffee-shop, he
                    called Xiu to ask for access to GHK.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, Xiu told him that
                    GHK was at her shop in East Coast and that if he wanted to see GHK, he would
                    have to go to the shop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    This upset the appellant and they heatedly quarrelled over the telephone. Xiu
                    hung up on the appellant but the appellant called Xiu repeatedly and uttered
                    profanities at her as he was very angry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After failing to obtain Xiu’s agreement
                    on access to GHK that night, the appellant decided to go to Xiu’s flat.
                    This was nearby. He walked back to his HDB block, retrieved his bicycle and
                    cycled to Xiu’s flat. The appellant testified that he had gone to
                    Xiu’s flat for several reasons. He wanted to know if the deceased was
                    happy after obtaining her Singapore citizenship and to ascertain her examination
                    results. He also hoped that when Xiu returned, he could bring GHK back to his
                        place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Further, he wanted to ask the deceased why
                    she had hit and threatened GHK.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> According to the appellant,
                    this was not the first time he had questioned the deceased on this
                        issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> These reasons were rejected by the trial
                    judge who determined that the appellant had gone to Xiu’s flat solely to
                    kill the deceased. We pause here to note that the Prosecution no longer supports
                    this finding of fact by the trial judge: see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events in Xiu’s flat leading to the homicide</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     When the appellant arrived at Xiu’s
                    place, the deceased opened the door and let him into the flat. At this time, the
                    two sub-tenants of Xiu’s flat, Zhao Jing and Liu Qiao Xiao
                    (“Liu”), were both in their bedroom. About two to three minutes
                    later, Zhao Jing walked to the toilet in the kitchen to take a shower. As she
                    did so, she saw the appellant sitting beside the deceased near the computer
                    table in the living room and noted that they were “talking in a normal
                    manner” and that they were “not quarrelling”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> After her
                    shower while returning to her room, Zhao Jing heard the appellant talking and
                    his tone sounded like he was laughing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Soon after, Zhao Jing heard a loud scream. The
                    deceased started calling out her name very loudly. Sensing that something was
                    wrong, she opened her bedroom door and saw the deceased lying on the floor. The
                    chair which the deceased was previously sitting on had toppled over and the
                    appellant was squatting beside her. Zhao Jing moved closer to the kitchen and
                    saw the appellant holding the deceased’s ear with one hand and her hair
                    with his other hand. The appellant was banging the deceased’s head against
                    the floor continuously and repeatedly shouted “Who am I” in
                        Mandarin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In his testimony, the appellant claimed that
                    the deceased was “very angry”, “disrespectful” and
                    had suddenly taken “something” from the computer table before he
                    grabbed hold of her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     When Zhao Jing tried to persuade the appellant
                    to release his hands, the appellant looked up at her. He stopped banging the
                    deceased’s head against the floor but his hands were still on her ear and
                    hair. The appellant was extremely agitated. He told Zhao Jing that he was the
                    deceased’s father and that Xiu had abandoned him. At the same time, the
                    deceased entreated Zhao Jing in a very weak voice to call
                        “999”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Zhao Jing returned to her
                    bedroom. Concluding that this was a case of family violence, she decided to call
                    Xiu instead of the police. As Zhao Jing and Liu could not locate Xiu’s
                    number on their mobile phones, Zhao Jing went to the living room to get the
                    deceased’s mobile phone. The appellant did not prevent her from doing so.
                    After retrieving it, Zhao Jing returned to her bedroom and called Xiu who told
                    her that she was rushing back home and to call for the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After the telephone conversation, Zhao Jing
                    proceeded to the living room again and noticed that one of the appellant’s
                    hands was on the deceased’s neck even though he was not applying any force
                        then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> He
                    was simply sitting on the deceased who was lying on the floor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Zhao Jing
                    tried to persuade him to release his hand but the appellant ignored her. He
                    continued to complain aloud that Xiu had abandoned him and that she was a bad
                    woman. As the appellant remained very agitated, Zhao Jing did not attempt to
                    contradict him. She observed that, by then, the deceased had stopped moving and
                    her face and feet had turned purplish.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Zhao Jing then ran back to her room and, as
                    she was doing so, noticed a knife handle without a blade lying by the side of
                    the appellant. On returning to the room, Zhao Jing told Liu that she was going
                    to the police post to seek help. When she found the police post closed, she
                    returned to the flat and observed that the main gate had been padlocked. She
                    gained entrance by using her keys to open the main gate and saw that the
                    appellant was using his mobile phone whilst still sitting on top of the
                        deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Zhao Jing left the flat again, without closing
                    the gate and wooden door, to call the police using her phone. She met the police
                    officers at the common staircase when they arrived and brought them to
                    Xiu’s flat. As the wooden door had again been closed, she had to use her
                    keys to open it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> After entering the flat, she noticed that
                    the appellant remained seated on top of the deceased. Zhao Jing then asked the
                    appellant why he had hurt the deceased. In response, he once again started
                    berating Xiu and all Chinese women.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s conduct after he strangled the
                deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It has been established that soon after the
                    appellant strangled the deceased, he made several telephone calls using his
                    mobile phone. He called his second brother, Ong Pang In (“Pang
                    In”), to inform him that he had killed the deceased and that he
                    “wanted to jump” to his death. He requested Pang In to cremate him
                    and to throw the ashes into the sea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> However, he was persuaded by
                    Pang In to wait for the police to arrive. The appellant next called the sales
                    manager of M/s Loh, Mr Loh Kian Choon (“Mr Loh”),
                    to inform him of his actions and apologised for being unable to work for
                    M/s Loh anymore. He also told Mr Loh that the key to the
                    company’s bus was at his home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The appellant also
                    called Xiu to tell her that he had killed the deceased. According to Xiu, he
                    sounded calm and as if “he was the victor”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to Staff Sergeant Lee Chee Mun
                    Tarmizi (“Ssgt Lee”) of the Civil Defence Force, he and his
                    crew arrived at Blk 24 of Marsiling Drive at about 10.34pm. When they
                    reached the sixth floor staircase landing after coming out of the lift, they met
                    a Chinese female (presumably Zhao Jing) who vigorously gestured to them and led
                    them to Xiu’s flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Ssgt Lee was the first to
                    speak to the appellant. He asked the appellant to move aside. The appellant
                    complied with this direction but repeatedly said to him “No hope”
                    in Mandarin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Shortly after the police officers arrived at
                    Xiu’s flat, the appellant gave his police statement to Sergeant Chng Chee
                    Wee (“Sgt Chng”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> In summary, the appellant stated
                    that he did not go to Xiu’s flat with any intention of killing the
                    deceased. He only formed such an intention after quarrelling with Xiu when he
                    called Xiu whilst in the flat. The appellant then strangled the deceased (while
                    apologising to the deceased at the same time) in order to cause Xiu to feel the
                    pain of losing a loved one. This statement was relied upon by the trial judge to
                    find that the appellant has gone to Xiu’s flat with the sole intention of
                    killing the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Three police officers testified that the
                    appellant “smelt” of alcohol when they saw him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> According to Sgt Chng, the
                    appellant would suddenly alternate between laughing and crying while at
                    Xiu’s flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> While the appellant was being interviewed
                    by Station Inspector Low Soon Hoe in the temporary holding area, he appeared to
                    be tipsy. Suddenly, he began to knock his head against the wall violently and
                    had to be restrained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The appellant was subsequently given a
                    medical examination at 1.24am on 21 October 2007, about three hours after
                    the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> His blood was also taken for alcohol testing
                    (“BAC”) and found to contain 84 mg of ethanol per 100ml of
                        blood.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The autopsy report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     An autopsy was carried out on the deceased on
                    21 October 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Dr Teo Eng Swee
                    (“Dr Teo”), a consultant forensic pathologist at the Health
                    Sciences Authority, certified that the deceased died from strangulation. During
                    trial, he testified that “moderate to severe force” must have been
                    applied to the deceased’s neck in order to cause
                        strangulation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The autopsy report also revealed that the
                    deceased suffered from several superficial incision and puncture wounds on her
                    neck, limb and abdomen. Dr Teo testified that the broken blade found in
                    Xiu’s flat was the cause of the incision and puncture wounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> He
                    stated that the superficiality of the incision wounds at the neck suggested that
                    they were not inflicted during a struggle; otherwise the incision would have
                    been deeper or less even.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> However, he admitted that it
                    was not possible to assert with any certainty whether these were peri or post
                    mortem injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As the fact of the killing was not disputed,
                    the trial judge noted, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Ong Pang
                        Siew</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 474 (“the judgment”)
                    (at [41]), that the only remaining issues were whether the appellant intended to
                    cause the death of the deceased and whether he was entitled to the defence of
                    diminished responsibility found in Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal
                    Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
                    evidence that he had gone to Xiu’s flat to wait for GHK (see [42] of the
                    judgment). He relied on the fact that the appellant was free for the whole of
                    that Saturday but chose to spend his time doing household chores and drinking
                    beer with his friends for five to six hours. The trial judge found (at [43] of
                    the judgment) that the appellant felt betrayed by Xiu after he had given her and
                    the deceased a new life in Singapore. After the quarrel over the phone with Xiu
                    about access to GHK, the appellant had proceeded to Xiu’s flat with the
                    intention of killing the deceased so that Xiu could experience the pain of
                    losing a loved one in the same way that he did after the family broke up (see
                    [43] and [47] of the judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The trial judge took into account the
                    following conduct of the appellant in determining that he was rational and had
                    intended to kill the deceased:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     After the deceased was pinned to the
                        floor by the appellant, he carried on hitting her head against the floor,
                        sat on top of her and strangled her. The appellant knew what he was doing
                        and was able to respond coherently to Zhao Jing’s pleas to let the
                        deceased go (see [44] of the judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant obviously used the knife’s
                        blade to make controlled and deliberate cuts on the deceased’s body.
                            <em>Whether the appellant inflicted the wounds before or
                            after the deceased’s death made no material difference since they
                            were intentional</em> (see [45] of the
                    judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        appellant’s conversations with Mr Loh and Xiu after the
                        deceased’s death and the subsequent communication with the police
                        officers who arrived at Xiu’s flat, <em>viz</em>
                        his request to go to the toilet, his knowledge of how serious his actions
                        were and that he would pay with his own life, showed his clarity of mind
                        (see [46] of the judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As for the defence of diminished
                    responsibility, the trial judge rejected the defence’s expert’s
                    opinion that the appellant suffered from major depressive disorder. Instead, he
                    accepted the Prosecution’s expert’s opinion that the appellant had
                    no mental illness (see [53] of the judgment). He held that even if the appellant
                    was suffering from a major depressive episode, there had been no substantial
                    impairment of his mental responsibility for his acts that night (see [54] of the
                    judgment). Accordingly, he found that the Prosecution had made out its case
                    against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defence of
                    diminished responsibility failed on a balance of probabilities. The appellant
                    was found guilty and convicted of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions by the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In this appeal, the appellant’s
                    submissions centred upon three issues. It was argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     the appellant did not intend to kill
                        the deceased (“the s 300(a)
                    submission”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appellant did not intend to inflict the injury which resulted in
                        the death of the deceased (“the s 300(c) submission”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        appellant qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility because he
                        was suffering from a major depressive disorder which led to a substantial
                        impairment of his mental responsibility at the time of the offence
                        (“the diminished responsibility
                submission”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Prosecution, on the other hand, submitted
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     the trial judge’s finding that
                        the appellant possessed the intention to kill the deceased should not be
                        disturbed as the appellant was capable of rational thought at the material
                        time. The finding of facts was not plainly wrong or arrived at against the
                        weight of the evidence on record;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appellant, by strangling the deceased, intended to
                        cause the injuries to her neck which was sufficient in the ordinary course
                        of nature to cause death;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> and</p>

                        impaired his mental responsibility at the time he killed the

                    pointing out that if the defence of diminished responsibility is made out, the
                    conviction of murder will have to be set aside and substituted by a conviction
                    of culpable homicide not amounting to murder as provided by Exception 7 in

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The s 300(a) and (c) submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We will first address, briefly, the trial
                    judge’s finding of fact that the appellant had gone to Xiu’s flat
                    with the sole intention of killing the deceased. He held that the appellant
                    intended to cause the deceased’s death when he went to Xiu’s flat
                    (see [42]–[47] of the judgment). However, in our view, this finding is not
                    supported by the evidence. The appellant had called Xiu at about 8.39pm on the
                    day of the offence to ask for access to GHK. A heated quarrel soon ensued
                    between them. Much was made of this fact by the Prosecution in the High Court to
                    establish that the appellant had proceeded to Xiu’s flat with the
                    intention of killing the deceased as he was very angry with her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> The trial judge accepted this
                    submission and observed that if the appellant had really wanted to see GHK, he
                    could have gone to Xiu’s shop in the East Coast to pick him
                        up.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However, it should also be noted that the
                    appellant knew that Xiu would eventually return to the flat with GHK and he
                    could pick GHK up from Xiu’s flat, which was only a few minutes away from
                    his home. There was thus good reason for the appellant to go directly to
                    Xiu’s flat in Marsiling instead of going to her shop in East Coast which
                    was much farther away and required motorised transport to reach. Furthermore, if
                    the appellant had indeed gone to Xiu’s flat just to kill the deceased,
                    there was no explanation for the time he spent amiably conversing with her. He
                    also knew that there were tenants in Xiu’s flat who would recognise him if
                    he harmed the deceased. Zhao Jing had testified that when she first saw the
                    appellant, he was talking to the deceased in a normal manner and they were not
                    quarrelling. In fact, she stated that the appellant’s tone “sounded
                    like he was laughing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Further, he made no attempt to
                    conceal his identity from Zhao Jing and Liu and in fact revealed to Zhao Jing
                    that he was the deceased’s father. In addition, the police statement
                    recorded by Sgt Chng at Xiu’s flat, which the trial judge relied on
                    in concluding that the appellant had intended to cause the deceased’s
                    death, also clearly emphasised that the appellant had gone to Xiu’s flat
                    without any intention of killing her. Sgt Chng recorded the appellant as
                    informing him that “[the appellant] came to the unit with <em>no intention</em> to kill [the deceased] at
                        all”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the course of oral submission, the
                    Prosecution conceded, after questioning from this court, that the evidence could
                    not support the trial judge’s finding that the appellant had gone to the
                    flat with the intention of killing the deceased. Instead, it submitted that the
                    appellant had probably formed the intention after he had “<em>snapped</em>”. This concession necessarily throws a
                    different light on the subsequent events that led to the killing of the deceased
                    by the appellant. We should add that if the Prosecution had not made this
                    concession, we would have found this to be a fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We accept that after he
                    “snapped”, the appellant intended to seriously harm, if not kill,
                    the deceased. He must have known that his act of strangling her might likely
                    kill her or, at the very least, cause injuries that would in the ordinary course
                    have been sufficient to kill her. The pathologist confirmed that moderate to
                    severe force was used in the strangulation. The death was not an accident. There
                    is also undisputed evidence that while strangling the deceased, the appellant
                    also apologised to her for the harm caused. This was recorded by Sgt Chng
                    on a piece of paper (and subsequently copied to his police patrol log sheet)
                    when he interviewed the appellant at Xiu’s flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> We further note
                    that after the deceased stopped moving, the appellant called in quick succession
                    Pang In, Mr Loh as well as Xiu to inform them that he had killed the
                    deceased. Certainly, at some level of consciousness the appellant was aware of
                    what he was doing. In the circumstances, we accept that the Prosecution has
                    established that the appellant intentionally committed an act of homicide. The
                    crucial issue is whether he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the
                    material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The trial judge rejected this defence because
                    he found that the appellant was “lucid and knew what he was
                    doing”. The trial judge also thought that the appellant’s ability
                    to respond coherently to Zhao Jing’s pleas to let go of the deceased
                    “pointed clearly to a rational person in possession of all his
                    senses” (at [54] of the judgment). With respect, this finding (for the
                    reasons we give below) over-simplified a complex amalgam of issues. It failed to
                    adequately take into account a crucial mass of evidence which unmistakeably
                    shows that many aspects of the appellant’s conduct that night were nothing
                    short of bizarre, if not entirely abnormal, when assessed holistically. The fact
                    that an accused may seem to behave rationally or respond coherently at different
                    points during an offending incident is by no means determinative of the
                    applicability of the defence of diminished responsibility (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>). Individuals suffering from some
                    types of serious mental illnesses do not entirely lose their ability to think or
                    function normally throughout (or even after) an offending episode. A failure to
                    appreciate this aspect of certain types of mental illnesses can lead to an
                    erroneous rejection of this statutory defence.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this case, the expert witnesses called by
                    the Prosecution and the appellant could not agree on whether, at the material
                    time, the appellant was suffering from a major depressive episode that caused an
                    abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for
                    his acts in causing the death of the deceased. The principles to be applied by
                    an appellate court in assessing a trial judge’s findings on expert
                    evidence have been set out in <em>Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    An appellate court will be slow to criticise
                            without good reason a trial court's findings on expert evidence; see the
                            Privy Council case of <em>Antonio Caldeira Dias v
                                Frederick Augustus Gray</em> AIR 1936 Journal 154 at 155, 157
                            and 158, ... <em>However, if the appellate court
                                entertains doubts as to whether the evidence has been satisfactorily
                                sifted or assessed by the trial court it may embark on its own
                                critical evaluation of the evidence focussing on obvious errors of
                                fact and/or deficiencies in the reasoning
                        process</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    Where there is conflicting evidence between experts
                            it will not be the sheer number of experts articulating a particular
                            opinion or view that matters, but rather the consistency and logic of
                            the preferred evidence that is paramount. Generally speaking, the court
                            should also scrutinise the credentials and relevant experience of the
                            experts in their professed and acknowledged areas of expertise. Not all
                            experts are of equal authority and/or reliability. In so far as medical
                            evidence is concerned, an expert with greater relevant clinical
                            experience may often prove to be more credible and reliable on
                            “hands-on” issues although this is not an inevitable rule
                            of thumb. Having said that, there is no precise pecking order or
                            hierarchy relating to expert evidence. Experts may sometimes be
                            abundantly eminent while lacking credibility in a particular
                            matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    What is axiomatic is that a judge is not entitled
                            to substitute his own views for those of an uncontradicted expert's:
                                <em>Saeng-Un Udom v PP</em> [2001]
                            2 SLR(R) 1. Be that as it may, a court must not on the other
                            hand unquestioningly accept unchallenged evidence. Evidence must
                            invariably be sifted, weighed and evaluated in the context of the
                            factual matrix and in particular, the objective facts. An expert's
                            opinion “<em>should not fly in the face of proven
                                extrinsic facts relevant to the matter</em>”... In
                            reality, substantially the same rules apply to the evaluation of expert
                            testimony as they would to other categories of witness testimony.
                            Content credibility, evidence of partiality, coherence and a need to
                            analyse the evidence in the context of established facts remain vital
                            considerations; demeanour, however, more often than not recedes into the
                            background as a yardstick.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Before setting out the expert witnesses’ respective opinions, it

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The <em>DSM-IV-TR</em>
                    also emphasises (at p 351) the importance of a careful interview in the
                    elicitation of symptoms of a major depressive episode:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A careful interview is essential to elicit symptoms of
                            a Major Depressive Episode. Reporting may be compromised by difficulties
                            in concentrating, impaired memory, or a tendency to deny, discount, or
                            explain away symptoms. Information from additional informants can be
                            especially helpful in clarifying the course of current or prior Major
                            Depressive Episodes and in assessing whether there have been any Manic
                            or Hypomanic Episodes</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In conducting a diagnosis of a patient, it is
                    important to ensure that the interviews with the patient are carried out
                    carefully. Additional information from people who would ordinarily interact with
                    the patient would be especially useful. Obviously, the patient, being unwell,
                    may not be the best source of information of his own mental state. It is also
                    not unusual for patients to play down their difficulties or be in a state of
                    denial. <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> further highlights that the
                    evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult
                    when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition
                        (<em>eg</em>, cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction and
                    diabetes) due to the overlap in their signs and symptoms. Such symptoms should
                    count towards a major depressive episode unless they are <em>clearly and fully</em> accounted for by a general medical condition.
                    Statistics stated in <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> show that up to 20%
                    to 25% of individuals with these aforesaid medical conditions will develop a
                    major depressive disorder during the course of their general medical
                        conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> In the <em>Clinical Practice
                        Guidelines, Depression</em> published in March 2004 (Ministry of
                    Health, Singapore), it is noted (at p 4) that there is a high prevalence of
                    depression in Singapore, with a percentage of 8.6% in adults. Further,
                    depression can co-exist with many medical conditions such as cancers
                    (25%–38%), diabetes (24%) or coronary artery disease
                        (16%–19%).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Several other factors which may lead to or
                    contribute to a major depressive disorder as provided in the <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> should be noted at this point. First, episodes of a
                    major depressive disorder often follow a severe psycho-social stressor, such as
                    the death of a loved one or a divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> Also, substance dependence
                    (particularly alcohol or cocaine dependence) may contribute to the onset or
                    exacerbation of a major depressive disorder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> Third, a major depressive
                    disorder is one point five to three times more common among first-degree
                    biological relatives of persons with this disorder than among the general
                        population.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Having considered the symptoms and guidelines
                    for the diagnostic process of a major depressive episode, we now set out the
                    expert opinions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appellant’s expert evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the trial, Dr Tommy Tan
                    (“Dr Tan”), a psychiatrist of some 15 years’
                    experience who is currently in private practice, testified on behalf of the
                    appellant. Dr Tan graduated from the National University of Singapore and
                    has a Master of Medicine degree in Psychiatry. He was previously the senior
                    consultant in the Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the Institute of Mental

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Dr Tan examined the appellant on three
                    occasions in August 2008. He communicated with the appellant in the Hokkien
                    dialect as the appellant was more comfortable conversing in Hokkien than in
                    Mandarin. Dr Tan said this helped him to establish good rapport with the
                    appellant and allowed him to elicit more information from him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Tan also interviewed Pang In, the appellant’s second sister, Sally
                    Ong (“Sally”), and fourth sister, Ong Ah Soi. Before examining the
                    appellant, Dr Tan read the report of the Prosecution’s expert,
                    Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”), dated
                    21 November 2007 (“Dr Goh’s first report) and the nursing

                    (“Dr Tan’s report”), Dr Tan noted that the
                    appellant has a “strong family history of mental

                    symptoms and observations of his recent behaviour by his family members.
                    Dr Tan gave his psychiatric diagnosis as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>

<u>Psychiatric Diagnosis</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Ong Pang Siew has <b>major depressive disorder,
                            single episode of moderate severity, chronic</b> (296.22,
                        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR) or <b>moderate
                            depressive episode without somatic syndrome</b> (F32.10,
                        International Classification of Diseases, edition 10) at the time of the
                        alleged offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is characterised by a moderately severe depressed mood, feelings of
                        frustration, irritability, lethargy, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of
                        weight, difficulty coping with work, negative thoughts and thoughts of
                        dying. He drank alcohol to help him to sleep and to cope with his depressed
                        mood.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He has depressed mood since 2005 or earlier. His mental disorder was
                        exacerbated by the divorce and the difficulties of having access to his
                        son.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had <b>acute alcohol intoxication</b> (303.00
                        DSM IV-TR; F10.0, ICD 10) at the time of the alleged offence. He and his
                        companions had drunk more than twenty bottles of beer from afternoon until
                        evening. He was tipsy after drinking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Mental State at the time of the alleged
                            offence</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pang Siew has major depressive disorder at the time of the alleged
                        offence. He was already depressed in mood. His depressive disorder made him
                        irritable. His wife had refused to let him have access to his son which made
                        him more frustrated and depressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He had been drinking for at least 5 to 6 hours before the alleged
                        offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He became very agitated by his stepdaughter. When his stepdaughter took a
                        knife, his actions were initially reactive or defensive. He was so agitated
                        that he lost his control of his actions. He was acting impulsively. He was
                        not aware of the consequences of his actions until after his stepdaughter
                        died.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He qualifies for the defence of diminished responsibility. He was
                        suffering from major depressive disorder that caused an abnormality of mind
                        that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts in
                        causing the death of his stepdaughter.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s expert evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In rebuttal of Dr Tan’s evidence,
                    the Prosecution called Dr Goh to give his expert opinion. Dr Goh has a
                    Masters degree in Psychiatry Medicine and a Masters degree in Clinical Forensic
                    Psychiatry &amp; Psychology (London). He has been an associate consultant at the
                    Institute of Mental Health for about eight years. In these eight years,
                    Dr Goh has given expert evidence once in the High Court and five times in
                    the Subordinate Courts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> The evidence in the High Court was on the
                    mental health of an accused charged with a sexual offence. This case was the
                    first occasion when Dr Goh gave expert evidence on the mental state of an
                    accused facing a capital charge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Dr Goh examined the appellant on three
                    occasions in November 2007 about three weeks after the offence. Unlike
                    Dr Tan, Dr Goh conducted his examination of the appellant in
                        Mandarin,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> notwithstanding the fact that the appellant was
                    “more comfortable with Hokkien”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> and had told Dr Goh
                    that he would “like to speak in Hokkien.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Although
                    Dr Goh explained to the appellant that he could seek any clarification
                    needed, he conceded that he did not tell the appellant that he could provide an
                    interpreter for the examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Before diagnosing the appellant, Dr Goh
                    spoke to Pang In and another sister of the appellant, Ong Tok May (“Tok
                    May”), on 15 November 2007. It appears that only brief details about
                    the appellant’s behaviour were obtained during this meeting. Dr Goh
                    learnt that the appellant was feeling “<em>pek
                        chek</em>” (frustrated) and “a bit sad” but was
                    able to work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The focus of that particular interview was on
                    the appellant’s family history of mental disorder. Pang In suffered from
                    depression and was then undergoing follow-up sessions. In addition, Tok May was
                    taking haloperidol, an anti-psychotic drug because “she thinks a
                        lot”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Also, the appellant’s mother had taken
                    some prescribed medication at a private clinic “to calm
                    down”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Dr Goh wrote two reports. The first,

                    brief account of the appellant’s personal background, his marital history
                    and noted that Pang In said the appellant was not “physically or verbally

                        was crying while he was strangling her, because he felt hurt that they
                        treated him poorly. When told by the ambulance crew that she had died, he
                        cried again.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The psychiatric nursing observations did not observe him to have any
                        persistent depressive symptom during his remand. Moreover, having a major
                        depressive episode would have impacted significantly on his functioning. He
                        was still able to fulfil his obligations at work as a bus driver leading to
                        the offence. He had no complaints about his work performance and did not
                        have any accident, complaints from his passengers or conflicts with other
                        motorists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence, I am of the opinion that Pang Siew did not have a major depressive
                        disorder around the time of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Although both Dr Tan and Dr Goh
                    acknowledged the significance of the appellant’s family history of mental
                    disorder, neither of them enquired deeply into the precise nature of the mental
                    disease(s) affecting the appellant’s family members and whether they were
                    hereditary in nature.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> As stated
                    (at [29] above), the trial judge accepted Dr Goh’s evidence that the
                    appellant was not suffering from a major depressive episode at the time of the
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Before we evaluate the evidence of the two
                    experts, it will be useful to set out generally the law on the defence of
                    diminished responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Law on diminished responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The defence of diminished responsibility is
                    encapsulated in Exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such
                        abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or
                        retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or
                        injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and
                        omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Exception 7 was derived from s 2 of
                    the English Homicide Act, 1957: see second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment)
                    Bill, <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (24 May 1961), vol 14 at
                    col 1509–1510 (K M Byrne, Minister for Labour and Law). The
                    effect of this defence is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">where the [fact-finder is] satisfied that a person charged with murder,
                        though not insane, suffered from mental weakness or abnormality bordering on
                        insanity to such an extent that his responsibility was substantially
                        diminished, the crime may be reduced from murder to culpable
                        homicide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(see <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Capital
                        Punishment</em> (1949–1953) (Cmnd 8932) at para 378). The
                    defence attempts to distinguish between different levels of control or
                    consciousness that a particular accused may have when the homicide is committed.
                    An accused who kills while suffering from the prescribed state of mental
                    abnormality is seen by the law to be morally less culpable and less deserving of
                    extreme punishment than one in full possession of his faculties. However, as
                    Professor Glanville Williams has penetratingly observed in Glanville Williams,
                        <em>Textbook pf Criminal Law</em> (Stevens &amp; Sons,
                    2nd Ed, 1983) at p 686:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t has meant that psychiatrists have been put under pressure to testify
                        in terms that go beyond their professional competence ... [as the]
                        requirement that the defendant’s abnormality of mind should have
                        substantially impaired his mental responsibility, is as embarrassing a
                        formula for a scientifically-minded witness as could be devised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It is trite law that the appellant bears the
                    burden of proving the defence of diminished responsibility on a balance of
                    probabilities: see <em>Chua Hwa Soon Jimmy v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 601 (at [8])
                        (“<em>Jimmy Chua</em>”). In <em>Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 70, this Court reiterated (at [46]) the three-limb test which
                    an accused has to satisfy to establish the defence of diminished
                    responsibility:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused was suffering from an
                        abnormality of mind at the time he caused the victim’s
                    death;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        abnormality of mind arose from a condition of arrested or retarded
                        development of mind or any inherent causes, or was induced by disease or
                        injury; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        abnormality of mind substantially impaired the accused’s mental
                        responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     This court held that whilst limb (b)
                    (otherwise known as the aetiology or root cause of the abnormality) is a matter
                    largely within the purview of expert opinion, limb (a) and limb (c)
                    are matters which cannot be the subject of any medical opinion and must be left
                    to the determination of the trial judge, as the finder of fact. In doing so, the
                    trial judge is, in the words of Lord Keith of Kinkel in <em>Walton v The Queen</em> [1978] 1 AC 788 (at 793):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>entitled and indeed bound to consider not only the
                            medical evidence but the evidence upon the whole facts and circumstances
                            of the case. These include the nature of the killing, the conduct of the
                            defendant before, at the time of and after it and any history of mental
                            abnormality. … That task is to be approached in a broad common
                            sense way. [emphasis added]</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Hence, in considering whether the defence of
                    diminished responsibility has been established, not only does the trial judge
                    have to consider the medical evidence, he is also required to take into account
                    all other relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of
                    the accused before, during and after the offence: see <em>Jimmy
                        Chua</em> (at [28]–[29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     What amounts to an “abnormality of
                    mind” under the defence of diminished responsibility has been explicated
                    in <em>R v Byrne</em> [1960] 2 QB 396 (at 403)
                        (“<em>R v Byrne</em>”) by
                    Lord Parker CJ as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Abnormality of mind,” … means a state of mind so
                        different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would
                        term it abnormal. It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the
                        mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of
                        physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment as to
                        whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will
                        power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment.
                            <em>The expression “mental responsibility for his
                            acts” points to a consideration of the extent to which the
                            accused’s mind is answerable for his physical acts which must
                            include a consideration of the extent of his ability to exercise will
                            power to control his physical acts</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This interpretation was accepted as correct
                    and authoritative by the Privy Council in <em>Elvan Rose v The
                        Queen</em> [1961] AC 496 (at 507). Lord Tucker
                    clarified (at 507–508) that the test is not necessarily “the
                    borderline of insanity”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships respectfully accept this interpretation of the words
                        “abnormality of mind” and “mental
                        responsibility” as authoritative and correct. They would not,
                        however, consider that the Court of Criminal Appeal was intending to lay
                        down that in every case the jury must necessarily be directed that the test
                        is always to be the borderline of insanity. There may be cases in which the
                        abnormality of mind relied upon cannot readily be related to any of the
                        generally recognised types of “insanity.” If, however,
                        insanity is to be taken into consideration, as undoubtedly will usually be
                        the case, the word must be used in its broad popular sense. It cannot too
                        often be emphasised that there is no formula that can safely be used in
                        every case—the direction to the jury must always be related to the
                        particular evidence that has been given and there may be cases where the
                        words “borderline” and “insanity” may not be
                        helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Tucker correctly emphasised that “<em>a man may know what he is doing and intend to do it and yet suffer from
                        such abnormality of mind as substantially impairs his mental
                        responsibility</em>” (at 508).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Lord Parker CJ’s
                    interpretation in <em>R v Byrne</em> of the term
                    ‘abnormality of mind’ has also been accepted by this Court in
                        <em>Jimmy Chua</em> (at [22]) and <em>Mansoor s/o Abdullah and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 403 (at [13]) for the purposes of limb (a) of
                    Exception 7. In <em>Jimmy Chua</em> (at [23]), this
                    court approvingly cited <em>R v Seers</em> (1984)
                    79 Cr App R 261, where Griffiths LJ held that chronic reactive
                    depression could on the evidence before him sustain the defence of diminished
                    responsibility. We should add that the nature of the causative injury can be
                    either physical or psychological. A reactive depression caused by extreme
                    adversity or stress may establish the exception: see <em>R v
                        Bathurst</em> [1968] 2 QB 99; <em>G
                        Krishnasamy Naidu v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 874 (“<em>Naidu</em>”);
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Juminem and another</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 536 (“<em>Juminem</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     What in fact amounts to a substantial
                    impairment of mental responsibility is largely a question of commonsense to be
                    decided by the trial judge as the finder of fact. As a working guide,
                    substantial does not require a total impairment; neither is it trivial nor
                    minimal: see <em>Juminem</em> (at [30]) applying <em>Regina v Lloyd</em> [1967] 1 QB 175 (at 178).
                        <em>As stated above, while medical evidence would be
                        important in determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether
                        an accused’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired is
                        ultimately a question to be decided by the court based on all the evidence
                        before it</em>: see <em>Zailani bin Ahmad v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (at [52]). The courts
                    have flexibly construed similar provisions in England and New South Wales and
                    have declined to confine the defence to just clinically recognised illnesses.
                    Indeed, the phrase “abnormality of mind” is wide enough to cover
                    all aspects of the mind’s activities including transient or ephemeral
                    manifestations of illnesses, though as a matter of construction (and policy) the
                    courts have excluded “mental disorders” solely attributable to the
                    consumption or mal-administration of alcohol, drugs or other like substances.
                    Such disorders are not due to inherent causes. The exception would also not
                    apply to emotions of rage, prejudices, hate, passing jealousy and the like
                    unless they are due to inherent causes rather than external stimuli alone.
                    However, if those emotions trigger an inherent internal derangement that
                    culminates in a pathological condition (<em>eg</em>, morbid
                    jealousy), then the exception could apply: see Naidu at
                ([9]–[10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In reviewing the trial judge’s decision,
                    we are conscious that, as an appellate court, we should be slow to overturn his
                    findings of fact unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the
                    weight of the evidence. However, when it comes to inferences of facts to be
                    drawn from the actual findings, a different approach will be taken. An appellate
                    court in such cases is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary
                    inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. Intervention by an
                    appellate court is justified when the inferences drawn by a trial judge are not
                    supported by the primary or objective evidence on record: <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 45 (at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evaluation of the expert witnesses’ diagnosis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Dr Goh, in his evidence, accepted that in
                    order to diagnose the appellant’s mental condition, it was necessary for
                    him to examine the appellant and to obtain information from those close to him
                    on whether the appellant was suffering from any impairment of functioning in the
                    relevant period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> Further, when evaluating the symptoms of
                    depression elicited from the appellant, he had to clarify whether there was any
                    significant impairment in his social functioning, such as his interaction with
                    friends, his time spent with his son and whether there was any occupational
                    impairment such as inability or difficulty in carrying on with his
                        work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This approach appears in line with the
                    guidelines in the diagnostic process provided by the <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>). However,
                    instead of adhering to this requisite standard, Dr Goh merely relied upon
                    his interviews with the appellant, Pang In and Tok May, and the nurses’
                    psychiatric observation charts to arrive at his conclusion that the appellant
                    was not suffering from any mental illness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> No interviews were
                    conducted with those who had the most recent and closest contact with the
                    appellant, namely, Xiu, GHK, Mr Loh or even the appellant’s drinking
                    friends. These were the people who also had frequent contact with the appellant
                    and would have been able to provide Dr Goh with crucial information that
                    could have shed much light on the appellant’s mental state at the time he
                    committed the offence. We are puzzled why Dr Goh did not do this. As the
                    Prosecution’s expert, he would have had little difficulty making
                    arrangements to interview these persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We noted earlier that the appellant’s
                    previous periods of employment lasted 11 years, six years and one year
                    successively and, at the time of the offence, he had been working at
                    M/s Loh for only about seven months. <em>It therefore
                        appears that within a period of less than 18 months preceding the death of
                        the deceased, the appellant had three different employers</em>. This
                    pattern was particularly striking since it departed starkly from his earlier
                    employment history. No evidence was led by the Prosecution on the reasons for
                    these rapid job changes. What happened and why did it happen? These facts could
                    be important but they were never looked into by Dr Goh. What was his state
                    of mind during the months leading up to the offence? After all, he was having
                    severe marital problems around this period of time. How did this affect his
                    work? As occupational impairment is a symptom of major depressive disorder, the
                    reasons that led the appellant to leave or be told to leave his two earlier jobs
                    could be significant. Although Dr Goh was told about the appellant’s
                    employment history, he did not regard it as material. Instead,
                    Dr Goh’s first report noted that the appellant often worked for
                    “many years for the same company” which,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> although true
                    for the most part of his employment history, was certainly inaccurate for the
                    one and a half years preceding the killing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As for the interview with Pang In and Tok May,
                    it was largely focused on their personal history of mental disorder with only
                    cursory details about the appellant’s health being discussed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Goh acknowledged that the appellant’s purported weight loss was an
                    important issue since it is a symptom of depression; yet he did not ask the
                    siblings about this issue at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> Further, Dr Goh did
                    not try to find out the nature of the actual mental ailments afflicting Pang In,
                    Tok May and the appellant’s mother. In Dr Goh’s first report,
                    he merely stated that Pang In was being treated for depression, with no mention
                    of the mental history of Tok May and the appellant’s mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Despite
                    reading Dr Tan’s report, Dr Goh did not seek further
                    clarification or to obtain more details about the “strong family history
                    of mental disorder” from either Pang In or Tok May.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> It
                    appears to us that he did not consider the family history factor as significant
                    enough to warrant a second look despite the possible increased risk (one point
                    five to three times) of the appellant developing a major depressive disorder on
                    the basis of this factor alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We have highlighted above that it appears that
                    20% to 25% of diabetic persons may suffer from major depressive
                        disorder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the appellant suffered
                    from hypertension and diabetes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> This was noted in
                    Dr Goh’s first report yet the correlation between diabetes and major
                    depressive disorder did not appear to have been properly considered by
                    Dr Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Another worrying feature about
                    Dr Goh’s examination of the appellant was that it was conducted in
                    Mandarin when the appellant’s preferred language of communication was
                        Hokkien.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> The trial judge stated (at [52] of the
                    judgment) that the appellant must have been conversant in Mandarin since Xiu is
                    from China and spoke to him in Mandarin. However, there is no evidence on the
                    nature of the conversations between the appellant and Xiu or about the
                    appellant’s level of proficiency in Mandarin. Given the difficulty in
                    eliciting symptoms of a major depressive disorder without clear
                        communication,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> it would have been prudent for Dr Goh to
                    have arranged for a Hokkien interpreter to be present for the interviews,
                    something which could have been easily done.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> We note that in the
                    course of cross-examination, Dr Goh acknowledged the possibility of
                    miscommunication between the appellant’s account of his mental health and
                    Dr Goh’s comprehension of the account given the lack of a common
                        language.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In our view, Dr Goh’s diagnostic
                    process fell short of the requisite standard prescribed under the <em>DSM-IV-TR</em>. In response to our concerns about the above
                    matters, the Prosecution submitted that while there are protocols which
                    psychiatrists bear in mind when diagnosing patients, in some cases they
                    nevertheless rely on their own experience in their assessments, this being one
                    of those cases. We were not impressed by this attempt to paper over the obvious
                    shortcomings. After all, this was the first case in which Dr Goh had
                    testified as an expert witness <em>on a murder charge</em>.
                    It would be a stretch to suggest that Dr Goh had any meaningful prior
                    experience to fall back on. Equally significant, the submission misses the real
                    point. Dr Goh’s diagnostic process did not even meet his very own
                    prescriptive methodology in examining patients on their mental capability,
                        <em>viz</em>, interviewing persons regularly
                    interacting with the appellant to determine if he had any impairment of social
                    or occupational functioning at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Given the unsatisfactory nature of
                    Dr Goh’s assessment, it would be unsafe, in our view, to rely on his
                    opinion that the appellant was not suffering from any form of mental
                    illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We now turn to Dr Tan’s evidence.
                    The defence and Dr Tan cannot be faulted for the interviews taking place
                    some ten months after the incident. It does not appear that there was any delay
                    attributable to counsel or the appellant. The appointment processes took some
                    time. Unlike Dr Goh, Dr Tan conducted his examination of the appellant
                    using Hokkien as he recognised the need to establish rapport with the
                        appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> Dr Tan also noted the history of
                    depression concerning Pang In, Tok May and the appellant’s mother,
                    although like Dr Goh, he was unsure of the exact nature of their mental
                    ailments. Dr Tan’s report, compared with both Dr Goh’s
                    first and second reports, contained a much more detailed account of the
                    appellant’s personal history. For example, he described the circumstances
                    which led to the deterioration of his marriage and his subsequent divorce, such
                    as the failed pregnancies, the opening of Xiu’s massage shops, her change
                    in dressing and their lack of communication due to their long working hours.
                    According to the appellant, he worked long hours, as much as 15 to 17 hours on
                        weekdays.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Dr Tan also recorded the
                    appellant’s family members’ descriptions of his character. According
                    to Pang In, the appellant was quite hot-tempered but he became less so after his
                    marriage in July 2002 at the age of 40 and he was very caring towards his
                        family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> Dr Tan further noted Pang In’s and
                    Sally’s observations on the appellant’s mood prior to the offence.
                    Dr Tan’s report stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pang In has seen Pang Siew in July, August, September 2007 before the
                        alleged offence. Pang Siew had approached him for money to pay the lawyer.
                            <em>Pang In said that Pang Siew looked very depressed. He
                            looked worried. He was also not responsive when spoken to. He was always
                            sighing. He was very negative and kept saying “die
                            already”. He told Pang In that he has a lot of worries, that life
                            has no meaning and he felt very frustrated</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Pang In also reported that Pang Siew was haggard
                            looking and had lost weight when he saw him from July to September 2007.
                            Pang Siew told Pang In that he was very depressed because he could not
                            see his son</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sally saw him in April 2007 during her daughter’s birthday. She
                        noticed that he was sad looking and not lively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">They said that Pang Siew has been drinking more as a result of his marital
                        problems. <em>Pang Siew drank less after he married but drank
                            more in the later part of his marriage. They said that when Pang Siew
                            drank, he could become agitated when someone irritated
                        him</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In contrast, the information elucidated from
                    the appellant’s family members as recorded in Dr Goh’s first
                    report merely stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Premorbid personality</em></b>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">His brother said he is not physically or verbally aggressive by nature and
                        that he is very responsible in his work and well-liked by his bosses. He is
                        very close to his son and would prepare food, bath and feed him with minimal
                        assistance from others after he got off from work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Dr Tan’s range of enquiries and
                    diagnostic process were undoubtedly more comprehensive than Dr Goh’s.
                    The information provided by the appellant’s family members would have
                    enabled Dr Tan to have a better picture of the appellant’s state of
                    mind prior to the offence. However, Dr Tan’s diagnosis also fell
                    short of being thorough. Like Dr Goh, Dr Tan did not interview Xiu,
                    GHK, Mr Loh or the appellant’s friends. In fairness, we should
                    mention that it would have been difficult for him (unlike Dr Goh) to have
                    secured the assistance of Xiu (or GHK) as he was an expert for the defence. With
                    regards to the appellant’s employment history, Dr Tan’s report
                    merely recorded that he had “worked for several transport
                        companies”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> without ascertaining the reasons for his
                    departure from those companies. Although Dr Tan noted that the appellant
                    has diabetes and hypertension,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> he did not, like Dr Goh,
                    appear to have assessed the correlation between these medical conditions and a
                    major depressive disorder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> In addition, as noted
                    above, both Dr Tan and Dr Goh were aware of the appellant’s
                    family history of depression but did not probe further into this. Deeper
                    inquiries into the precise nature of their mental ailments ought to have been
                    conducted in order to determine if they were hereditary in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Hence, even though Dr Tan’s
                    diagnostic process was more detailed than Dr Goh’s, it was not
                    entirely satisfactory. More could and should have been done by both Dr Tan
                    and Dr Goh (and counsel) to ensure that the trial judge was provided with
                    detailed information of matters relevant to the appellant’s state of mind
                    at the time of the offence. This is especially important given the nature of the
                    offence and the mandatory punishment that would follow a conviction. Bearing in
                    mind the above concerns, we shall now analyse in greater detail
                    Dr Tan’s and Dr Goh’s psychiatric diagnosis of the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Comparison between Dr Tan’s and Dr Goh’s
                diagnosis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The fundamental difference between
                    Dr Tan’s and Dr Goh’s diagnosis lies in the number of
                    symptoms listed under Criterion A of major depressive episode that was
                    elicited from the appellant. Under the <em>DSM-IV-TR</em>,
                    at least five of the nine listed symptoms must be present before a diagnosis of
                    major depressive episode can be made. Dr Tan elicited eight symptoms from
                    the appellant while Dr Goh could only elicit two.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> For

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The above evidence, if unchallenged by the
                    Prosecution, would have established, apart from Requirements (1) and (7),
                    Requirements (3), (4), (5), (6) and (9) of Criterion A. There is an
                    established rule of evidence that if what a witness says is not challenged, the
                    evidence is deemed to have been admitted: the rule in <em>Browne
                        v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67. The purpose of the rule is to secure
                    procedural fairness in litigation (see <em>Yeo Kwan Wee Kenneth v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 45 (at [3])). The
                    rule requires that matters that are challenged be put to the witness during
                    cross-examination to give the witness an opportunity to respond. Unchallenged
                    testimony may be considered by the court to be undisputed by the opposing party
                    and therefore accepted.</p>

                        period.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Regrettably, there was no objective evidence
                    produced by either party to show if and when the appellant had suffered from
                    significant weight loss even though this fact could have been easily
                    ascertained, in particular, by the Prosecution. While the appellant stated that
                    he did not lose weight during the period of employment before the offence, this
                    was contradicted by one of the Prosecution’s witnesses, Mr Loh. He
                    testified after examining a photograph taken on the day of the offence that the
                    appellant appeared to have lost weight.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> Mr Loh’s
                    evidence on this point was not challenged by the Prosecution and the Prosecution
                    did not dispute that the appellant used to weigh over 200 pounds. This
                    underscores our concern that the appellant may not be the best person to provide
                    information about his health. More crucially, the appellant’s evidence was
                    that he started losing weight because of the pressure from his marital problems
                    in 2005. This point was not disputed by the Prosecution. It only asked if the
                    appellant’s weight remained constant during his period of employment with
                    Mr Loh in 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> Further, Oon Kim Lye, a friend of
                    the appellant, stated that the appellant had lost “quite a bit of weight
                    after he divorced his wife.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> Dr Goh’s evidence
                    that the absence of significant weight loss without dieting was “not
                    elicited” from the appellant was rather remarkable. He did not ask anyone
                    about the issue of weight loss and did not rely on any objective evidence in
                    assessing this criterion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> Accordingly,
                    Requirement 3 of Criterion A must be taken to be established.
                    Similarly, with regards to the appellant’s reported problem of insomnia
                        <em>ie</em>, Requirement 4 of Criterion A,
                    the evidence that he was unable to sleep at night as he kept thinking of his son
                    and about why his wife had “behaved in that way” was not
                    challenged by the Prosecution during cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     We note that the trial judge had found (at
                    [51] of the judgment) that the appellant’s weight loss was deliberate
                    because of his diabetes and hypertension and that the appellant had said as much
                    to Mr Loh. In our view, this finding is debatable considering that
                    Mr Loh was not even aware of the actual health reason or that the appellant
                    was diabetic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> When asked specifically whether the
                    appellant had told him the reason for his weight loss, Mr Loh could only
                    state, “Er, I <em>think</em> it’s for health
                    reason” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> Further, with regard to
                    the finding that the appellant’s sleeping problem arose only after the
                    incident based on his own account to Dr Goh, we have already pointed to the
                    language barrier between the appellant and Dr Goh and the fact that he had
                    conceded the possibility of miscommunication (see above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>). The appellant’s consistent evidence
                    was that his sleeping problem arose well before the incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In addition, the appellant verified Pang
                    In’s and Sally’s observations (as recorded in Dr Tan’s
                    report) that the appellant had become very negative and was unresponsive when
                    spoken to. He had also informed Dr Tan that he did not feel like working
                    but had to work because he needed his job. These two nuggets of information
                    provided the basis for Dr Tan’s finding that the appellant had
                    psychomotor retardation and was suffering from fatigue or loss of energy
                    (Requirements 5 and 6 of Criterion A).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> Again, the Prosecution did
                    not properly challenge the appellant’s testimony on this point. All it
                    asked was whether the appellant had complained to Mr Loh about his long
                    working hours,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> and whether he had any problems
                    coping with the demands of his work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> Here we should pause to
                    observe that the appellant ordinarily worked 15–17 hours a day on
                    weekdays. He would certainly have been overstretched at work. Unfortunately,
                    this aspect of his working conditions was not explored by counsel or by the
                    psychiatrists. It is also worth noting that Pang In was a Prosecution’s
                    witness and yet the Prosecution did not consider it necessary to clarify whether
                    what he had told Dr Tan about the appellant appearing depressed and worried
                    as well as unresponsive when spoken to were true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As for Requirement 9 of Criterion A,
                    that is to say the appellant having suicidal thoughts, the Prosecution did
                    briefly attempt to cross-examine him on this issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> The
                    appellant had insisted that he had been entertaining suicidal thoughts even
                    before the offence and that he had told Xiu that he found life to be tough-going
                    and that he was a failure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> All the Prosecution
                    tepidly put to the appellant was that he was merely embellishing his evidence
                    because if he had had suicidal thoughts before the offence, he would have
                    mentioned it to Dr Goh during his examination. However, we have already
                    explained why Dr Goh’s investigative procedures were less than
                    satisfactory. Many questions that should have been asked were not asked.
                    Information that ought to have been obtained was not. In short, the fact that
                    this information was not found in both of Dr Goh’s reports certainly
                    does not mean that the appellant did not have suicidal thoughts before the
                    incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The appellant verified that even before the
                    incident he was feeling very negative and had repeatedly told Pang In, in
                    anguish, “die already”. He had also told Pang In that he had a lot
                    of worries and that life had no meaning. Although it was established during
                    trial that Pang In had met the appellant only once within the period of six
                    months preceding the offence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> the
                    Prosecution did not dispute that they often spoke to each other on the
                        phone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> If the Prosecution intended to contest the
                    appellant’s testimony on this issue, it ought to have recalled Pang In to
                    ascertain the position. This was not done. In the circumstances, we find that
                    Dr Tan’s finding that the appellant was entertaining suicidal
                    thoughts even prior to the incident should have been preferred by the trial
                    judge. Accordingly, Requirement 9 of Criterion A was also
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Both Dr Tan and Dr Goh were of the
                    opinion that Requirements 1 and 7 of Criterion A of a major depressive
                    episode were displayed by the appellant. For the above reasons, we also prefer
                    Dr Tan’s opinion that Requirements 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 were also
                    present. Since more than five of the listed requirements were present,
                    Criterion A is satisfied. As for Criterion C, which requires
                    impairment of social or occupational functioning, this point is related to
                    Requirement 5 of Criterion A. Sally had observed that the appellant
                    was sad-looking and was not lively when she met him at her daughter’s
                    birthday. Also, as stated, Pang In told Dr Tan that the appellant was
                    unresponsive when spoken to. Both accounts were not challenged by the
                    Prosecution. According to Dr Tan, this showed that there was a change in
                    the appellant’s behaviour and he was unable to enjoy pleasurable
                        experiences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In the circumstances, we find that
                    Dr Tan’s report, which opined that the criteria for making a
                    diagnosis of a major depressive disorder had been satisfied, was preferable to
                    Dr Goh’s. We now turn to the non-medical evidence. The evidence (in
                    particular, the appellant’s conduct before, during and after the offence)
                    compels us to arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The other factors considered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Zhao Jing testified that when the appellant
                    hit the deceased’s head against the floor, he was very agitated and kept
                    shouting “Who am I”. He refused to release his hands even when
                    asked to do so by Zhao Jing (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>–<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>). In his
                    statement recorded by Sgt Chng, the appellant stated that when he was
                    strangling the deceased, he kept on apologising to her and said that he was left
                    with no choice but to kill her. The appellant’s violence was not in
                    keeping with his character and temperament. Xiu had testified that even when the
                    appellant’s temperament was bad, the appellant would only utter nasty
                    words but would not resort to violence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Zhao Jing had left Xiu’s flat to go to
                    the police post soon after she called Xiu to inform her of the situation. When
                    she returned, the main gate was padlocked and the wooden door closed even though
                    she did not lock or close them. Upon re-entry, she saw that the appellant was
                    still sitting on the deceased even though the deceased had stopped moving. The
                    appellant remained in the same position when she left the flat a second time and
                    returned with the police officers. The appellant admitted during
                    cross-examination that he had closed the main gate on both occasions but he
                    could not explain why he did so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> His actions were
                    inexplicable; twice, he closed the main gate and wooden door and then went back
                    to sit on the deceased. He must thus have sat on the deceased for about half an
                    hour (from the time before Xiu made the first information report at
                        10.15pm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> to the time that the police arrived at about
                    10.35 pm).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> There was no rational explanation for the
                    appellant’s behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     One of the phone calls made by the appellant
                    after he killed the deceased was to inform Mr Loh that he could no longer
                    work for M/s Loh. He apologised for not being able to carry out his driving
                    assignment the next day and told him that the key to the company’s bus was
                    at his home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> It was curious why despite having committed
                    such a serious offence, the appellant seemed unduly concerned by such an
                    inconsequential matter. Rather than showing clarity of mind, as the trial judge
                    seemed to have thought,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> we
                    are of the view that this conduct was abnormal behaviour, unless he was a
                    cold-blooded murderer; we, however, do not think he is one. This view is
                    reinforced by the fact that the appellant was later observed to be laughing and
                    crying when the police officers arrived at Xiu’s flat. Later, he began
                    banging his head against the wall in the temporary holding area (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) while being
                interviewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The appellant’s physical condition as a
                    result of the drinking binge he had just before the incident is also an
                    important consideration. As noted above, the appellant had a BAC of 84 mg
                    per 100ml of ethanol about three hours after the offence was committed. This is
                    not an inconsiderable amount. Indeed, his BAC must have been much higher at the
                    time of the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> That the effect of the
                    alcohol could have exacerbated his depression at the time of the offence was
                    recognised by both Dr Tan and Dr Goh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> We
                    recognise that self-induced intoxication is not a specified cause under
                    limb (b) of the defence of diminished responsibility: see <em>Tengku Jonaris Badlishah v Public Prosecutor</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 800 (at [62]); <em>Zailani bin Ahmad v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (at [59]–[61]).
                    However, what we are concerned with is the correlation between alcohol
                    dependence and major depressive disorder as provided by the <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>). It is true that the appellant said in cross-examination that
                    he was a good drinker and that his drinking habit had never previously affected
                    his daily functions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> However, we have to also consider the not
                    unlikely possibility of a depressed patient downplaying his own symptoms.
                    Dr Tan’s report recorded that Pang In and Sally observed that the
                    appellant had been drinking more as a result of his marital problems<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    appellant drank “1 to 2 bottles of beer every night” because he
                    was depressed at being alone at home. He kept thinking of his son and had

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Despite acknowledging that the appellant
                        <em>was behaving abnormally at the time of the
                        killing</em>, Dr Goh surprisingly maintained that the appellant
                    suffered from no mental illness. When asked for an explanation for his abnormal
                    behaviour, Dr Goh was unable to provide a convincing answer. While
                    Dr Goh had quite correctly observed in his first report that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>the effect of [the appellant’s] recent ingestion
                            of alcohol and the heightened emotions during altercations with his wife
                            and the victim that night, in a background of severe and longstanding
                            marital and family problems, had contributed to his actions leading to
                            the offence</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(see above at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>), he did not go
                    on to properly analyse how the unhappy confluence of all these psycho-social
                    pressures insidiously conspired to cause the appellant’s dysfunctional
                    conduct that night.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Dr Goh was plainly aware of the
                    appellant’s “severe and longstanding” marital
                        problems,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> as well as other factors such as his family
                    history of mental disorder and his diabetes and hypertension.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> He knew that
                    the appellant had consumed a lot of alcohol and had a heated altercation with
                    Xiu for not allowing him access to GHK just before the incident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span> He was
                    even willing to accept that the appellant was behaving abnormally at the
                    material time. The appellant’s bizarre mood swings during the incident,
                    banging the deceased’s head intermittently on the floor, strangling her in
                    the presence of a witness,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> laughing and crying simultaneously,
                    apologising to the deceased while strangling her,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> banging
                    his head against a wall had all been observed by Zhao Jing, Sgt Chng and
                    SSgt Lee or documented.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> The phone calls to inform

                    Pang In that he was going to commit suicide by jumping from Xiu’s flat and
                    requesting Pang In to “cremate [him] and throw the ashes to the
                        sea”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span> further illustrated the abnormality of his
                    mental state. We noted above (at [91]) that the appellant spent a long time
                    kneeling next to or sitting on the deceased even after she had lost
                    consciousness. When the paramedics arrived, they found the appellant still
                    kneeling on the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span> In addition, a photograph of
                    the appellant taken some hours after the incident showed both his knees to be
                    visibly red and sore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> This is not an unimportant fact. Why did he
                    spend such an inordinate amount of time kneeling on or next to the deceased even
                    after she died?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Dr Goh had been informed by the appellant
                    that his emotions were “very chaotic during [the] struggle”. There
                    was plainly objective evidence to support this assertion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> Yet,
                    Dr Goh adamantly maintained that the appellant had no mental illness at the
                    material time. Given the unsatisfactory nature of his limited enquiries, his
                    less than rigorous interviews with the appellant, his lack of experience in
                    diagnosing persons charged with committing a capital crime and his failure to
                    adequately analyse and holistically explain several aspects of the
                    appellant’s conduct that fateful night, we find Dr Goh’s
                    diagnosis of the appellant’s mental condition at the material time less
                    convincing than that of Dr Tan’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Before we conclude our analysis, we ought to
                    address a further finding of the trial judge that led him to convict the
                    appellant of murder. He found that the several superficial incision and puncture
                    wounds on the deceased’s neck, limb and abdomen must have been inflicted
                    by the appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span> The appellant had no recollection of
                    this event and was adamant during trial that he did not touch the knife found at
                    Xiu’s flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span> His fingerprints were not found on the
                    knife or its handle. The trial judge found that it was not material whether
                        <em>the appellant inflicted them before or after the death of
                        the deceased</em>. In our view, this is a material fact. According to
                    the pathologist, the superficiality of the wounds suggested that they were not
                    inflicted during a struggle. <em>The blade had been applied very
                        lightly to the skin in a controlled manner</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span> If this were not so, the incisions would
                    have been deeper or less uniform.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span> We note that counsel for
                    the appellant, quite rightly, has not suggested that these wounds were
                    self-inflicted. More importantly, there does not appear to have been serious
                    blood loss as a consequence of those wounds. We therefore find that they were
                    likely to have been inflicted after the deceased had died or lost consciousness.
                    This further reinforces our view that the appellant was behaving abnormally at
                    the time of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     For all the above reasons, we find that on a
                    balance of probabilities, the appellant has made out the defence of diminished
                    responsibility. In the result, we set aside the conviction on the charge of
                    murder and convict him on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder
                    punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code and remit this case to the
                    trial judge for sentencing.</p>
