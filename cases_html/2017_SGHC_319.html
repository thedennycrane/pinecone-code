I note that these loans to Biomax Technologies (“the BT Loans”) do not form part of the subject matter of the present suit, but I briefly describe them here to provide some background on the other transactions which the parties were involved in. The loan monies were disbursed by the Plaintiff to Biomax Technologies by way of cash, cheque and telegraphic transfer. The first loan of $1m was promptly repaid to the Plaintiff in September 2015 along with the 10% interest as agreed.

</div> The Plaintiff appealed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The legal principles on summary judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As the legal principles on summary judgment under O 14 of the ROC are well-known, I will set them out briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In order to obtain judgment, a plaintiff must first show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment. If the plaintiff satisfies this, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC; <span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Straitsworld Advisory Ltd and another </span>[2017] SGHC 35 (“<span class="font-italic">KLW</span>”) at [16]). If the defendant can establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence, he ought to have leave to defend (<span class="font-italic">Habibullah</span><span class="font-italic"> Mohamed Yousoff v Indian Bank </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, a court will not grant leave “if all the defendant provides a mere assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the basis of his defence” (<span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko </span>[2015] 1 SLR 325 (“<span class="font-italic">M2B</span>”) at [19]), or if the assertions in affidavit are equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent or inherently improbable (<span class="font-italic">KLW</span> at [16]; <span class="font-italic">M2B</span> at [19]). The case law makes clear that the proper course is not for the court to assume that every sworn averment is to be accepted as true, or that such an averment may, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, provide a basis for leave to defend (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam </span><span class="font-italic">Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 (“<span class="font-italic">South Kerala Cashew</span>”) at [38]; see also <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Apart from showing the existence of triable issues, the defendant may also avoid summary judgment by showing “that there ought for some other reason to be a trial” (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC). In <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering Pte Ltd v United Malayan Banking Corp </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>”) at [12], Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was), following <span class="font-italic">Miles v Bull</span> [1969] 1 QB 258 at 266A–C, held that there would be “some other reason” for a trial if the defendant is able to satisfy the court that there are circumstances that ought to be investigated, especially where most or all of the relevant facts are under the plaintiff’s control. The defendant must be able to show clear justification for this; vague allegations that a case needs to be investigated in the absence of good reason would <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute some other reason for trial (<span class="font-italic">KLW</span> at [57], citing Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure</span> (Academy Publishing, 2013) at p 267).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Plaintiff was precluded from applying for summary judgment in the present suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As a preliminary issue, I note that the Defendant argued that allowing the Plaintiff to apply for summary judgment in the present suit would be tantamount to giving her a second bite of the cherry, after the court had already granted unconditional leave to the defendants to defend Suit 765. The Defendant contended that this might result in conflicting interpretations of the same contract by different fora. I found that the Defendant’s contentions were unwarranted in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 While both suits involve substantially the same facts, similar contractual arrangements and almost the same parties (with the exception of Biomax Technologies), the claims made in each suit were different. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Suit 765 was brought by the Plaintiff in respect of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the $250,000 in interest or facility fees that was allegedly due from the Defendant under the Loan, whereas the present suit involves the $5m principal and interest accruing on and after 6 January 2016 (see [17] and [21] above). Suit 765 also involves the repayment of the BT Loans (see [17] above), which does not form part of the subject matter of the present suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defences pleaded in each suit are different as well, even though certain defences such as the moneylending defence do overlap. For instance, a substantial part of the defence in Suit 765 related to the enforceability of the SA and the terms which were added to the amended CLA (see [18] above). The same defence was not pleaded in the present suit, ostensibly because the principal and interest claimed in the present suit are part of the original CLA and therefore not contingent upon the enforceability of the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In granting summary judgment in Suit 765, the Registrar did not provide an indication as to which issue or issues he considered to be triable. The defendants in Suit 765 may very well have been granted unconditional leave to defend on the basis of issues, claims and defences that do not arise in the present suit. There was therefore no basis to conclude that the present application for summary judgment is barred by <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or otherwise improper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Registrar did not make any determination on the interpretation of any contract in Suit 765, and nor will my decision in respect of the current application. The Defendant’s concerns about the risk of there being conflicting interpretations of the same contract were thus similarly unwarranted. Accordingly, I move on to consider the substantive defences raised by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The moneylending defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Defendant essentially advanced the same arguments as it did below, by asserting that the moneylending and money laundering defences were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and raised triable issues. I will begin with the moneylending defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It was not disputed by the parties that the Loan was in fact a loan made in consideration of a larger sum being repaid, and that the Plaintiff was not a licensed or exempt moneylender within the meaning of ss 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Moneylenders Act respectively. In my view, the moneylending defence turned on one critical point: whether the Plaintiff was an “excluded moneylender” within the definition stated in s 2 of the Moneylenders Act. If so, the Plaintiff’s loans would not be illegal under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Moneylenders Act. Section 2 defines “excluded moneylender” to include<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>any person who lends money solely to corporations, as well as “any person carrying on any business not having for its primary object the lending of money in the course of which and for the purposes whereof he lends money<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">”.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Defendant’s case was that the Plaintiff was not an “excluded moneylender” as she had lent money to an individual named Ron Sim through Han (see [23(d)] above). Sim later elaborated in his affidavit that he had been told by Han that Han had lent $8m to Ron Sim of OSIM International Ltd (“OSIM”) for his personal investment in the tea business.

</div> As stated in <span class="font-italic">M2B</span> at [19], the court will not grant leave to defend solely on the basis of mere assertions that are lacking in precision or inherently improbable.

Because of this finding, there was no need to consider the further questions of whether Han acted as a proxy for the Plaintiff such that any prohibited loans given by Han be imputed to the Plaintiff, whether the Plaintiff carried on the business of moneylending under s 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act, or whether any of these amounted to triable issues.

According to an article dated 27 June 2017 published on the websites of the Communist Party of China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Jieyang City government website, Han had reported voluntarily to the authorities in the PRC on 9 July 2015 to assist in the investigations against him.

All that was left was the fact that these investigations had begun in the first place, as well as the disbursement of the Loan in large amounts of cash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Although the cash payments did give me some pause, I considered that there was no evidence of any criminal investigations in Singapore in respect of the Plaintiff or Han. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Furthermore,<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>money laundering statutory provisions such as ss 44 and 47 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”) (for assisting another to retain the benefits of criminal conduct, and for acquiring, possessing, using, concealing or transferring benefits of criminal conduct, respectively) make clear that there must be a predicate criminal offence.

The appellant’s received sums of monies in cash totalling over $2m, which she subsequently sent on to other individuals in a variety of ways, including by remittance through a money-changer and by handing over sums in cash. The appellant argued that the Prosecution had not satisfied the requirement of producing a foreign certificate in order to prove the commission of a<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>serious foreign offence from which the monies were derived.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) V K Rajah JA held at [58] that whilst it was not necessary to impose on the prosecution “the heavy and impractical burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the crime or class of crime that may constitute the predicate offence”, it was necessary to at least adduce particulars of the commission of the predicate offence or a class thereof. At [59]–[60], Rajah JA explained that this could be done by leading evidence pertaining to the criminal conduct that took place outside Singapore, or in appropriate cases, by producing a certificate issued by or on behalf of the government of the foreign jurisdiction stating the offence in question. I note with caution, however, that <span class="font-italic">Ang Jeanette</span> was a criminal case which involved a different standard of proof and rather different issues before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Reference may also be made to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">WBL Corp Ltd v Lew Chee Fai Kevin </span>[2012] 2 SLR 978 (“<span class="font-italic">WBL</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Lew, a senior executive of WBL Corporation Ltd (“WBL”), was granted share options to purchase WBL shares under an employee share option scheme. After acquiring confidential, price<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">-</span>sensitive information<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">,</span> Lew sold a quantity of WBL shares and used the proceeds to exercise his share options. WBL, suspecting that insider trading had occurred, made a Suspicious Transaction Report and thereafter declined to issue the shares on the due date on the basis that Lew was using the proceeds of the insider trading transaction. In short, WBL’s defence to Lew’s claim against it for specific performance for the issuance of the shares was that it was not in breach of its obligations under the share option scheme, because it would have been illegal to issue the shares (i) under common law and (ii) under ss 44 and 47 of the CDSA (at [2]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Andrew Phang JA, writing for the Court of Appeal, stated at [39] that “[p]erformance of a contract is illegal if it would be illegal for either party to perform because the contract itself is prohibited, and the innocent party is entitled to refuse performance on that basis even if performance would be legal on its part” [emphasis omitted]. In this regard, the Court of Appeal added that “an important threshold issue is whether or not there was any criminal conduct in the first place”. To this end, it was necessary to show that Lew’s claim for specific performance to issue the shares was premised upon an illegality (at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Court of Appeal rejected WBL’s submission that the performance of its obligations would have been illegal and caught by s 44 of the CDSA. This was because under s 40, by filing the Suspicious Transaction Report, WBL would have been exonerated from any offence under s 44 (at [21]). Even if s 40 did not preclude the application of s 44 CDSA, it was still not illegal for WBL to issue the shares to Lew. Section 44 only applied if the proceeds of the insider trading used to exercise the share options were the “benefits of criminal conduct”. No criminal proceedings had been brought. Instead, the Public Prosecutor simply “permitted” the Monetary Authority of Singapore to commence civil proceedings against Lew (at [32]). Section 47, which concerns the benefits of criminal conduct, also did not apply on the facts for the same reason, namely, that no criminal proceedings had been brought against Lew.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It followed that the common law defence of illegality also failed: WBL could not show that Lew’s claim for specific performance of its contractual obligation was premised on an illegality (at [41]). Whilst it may have been that at the due date for performance (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the issuance of the shares) the Public Prosecutor had not yet made the decision of whether to bring criminal proceedings or to allow MAS to bring civil proceedings, this made no difference to the parties’ obligations under the contract as no defence of “wait and see” had been expressly provided for in the contract (at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Court of Appeal further noted that in the event the Public Prosecutor were to<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>subsequently prosecute Lew for insider trading<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">,</span> it would be for the Public Prosecutor to follow up on the consequences of any criminal conduct, for example, by applying for an order to confiscate the benefits of criminal conduct under Part II of the CDSA (at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Returning to the present case, the Defendant did not even make any Suspicious Transaction Report to the police before (and indeed, despite) having now made these allegations of money laundering.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>As the Plaintiff argued, the Defendant had a statutory obligation under s 39(1) of the CDSA to make such a report if it truly had reasonable grounds to suspect that the Loan represented or was used in connection with criminal conduct.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  NE of hearing on 5 October 2017.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I agreed that the fact that the Defendant had not done so was indicative of a lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in their own assertions about money laundering.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Even if the money laundering allegation could be proved at trial, the Defendant would nonetheless still be obliged under the CLA to repay the Loan and the outstanding interest claimed in this suit (see <span class="font-italic">WBL</span> at [41]). Moreover, it would <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi </span>be for the Public Prosecutor to follow up on the consequences of any criminal conduct (see <span class="font-italic">WBL</span> at [44]). It was not for the Defendant to raise this as a defence in the present suit to avoid repayment of the Loan. Accordingly, I found that the money laundering defence was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It bears repeating that there was<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>no evidence that Han had been charged, let alone convicted of any offence in the PRC or elsewhere. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As noted at [</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">48] above, even though the Defendant referred to the Red Notice, the HSBC letter and the investigations in Hong Kong concerning Han, the fact remains that </span>as at the hearing before me, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Han had not been convicted and appeared to be able to travel freely. Indeed, the investigation by the authorities in Hong Kong concluded in 2016 without any charges brought. </span>There was also <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">no evidence of any investigation for any offence carried out by the authorities in Singapore.</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The allegation that the sums paid over to the Defendant were the proceeds of or derived from some foreign offence is vague and unsubstantiated to say the least.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 What the facts do establish is that the Plaintiff has loaned a considerable sum of money to the Defendant. There is no doubt at all that the Defendant received the monies under the CLA. Whilst the Defendant makes much of the fact that the Loan was disbursed in three tranches of cash, it cannot be nor is it denied that these sums were in fact received by the Defendant without complaint or query at the time. Even though the CLA referred to disbursement of the loan by telegraphic transfer, the Defendant clearly accepted the disbursement by means of the three cash tranches. Any assertion that there is no obligation to repay the loan (which was freely accepted) and interest because of the above is extraordinary. I shall return to this point below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I also did not see any “other reason for a trial”. The facts of <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>, which the Defendant pointed to, are easily distinguishable. <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span> involved forged cheques that had been paid out from the plaintiffs’ account. In respect of the forgery, there were ongoing police investigations and the police had already arrested a person. Two persons who were responsible for the cashing of the disputed cheques had already been convicted for the offence of cheating. There was an expert report concluding that the cheques were in fact forged. Even though the defendant bank was unable to point to any specific defence under the law at the time, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) observed at [18] that it was still possible for the bank to show that the plaintiff was complicit in the forgeries, depending on how the evidence unravelled at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In contrast, the allegations of money laundering in the present case were largely speculative, with no sign of any Suspicious Transaction Report made or any local criminal investigations underway. Moreover, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Concentrate Engineering</span>, any new facts proved with regard to the money laundering defence would not have affected the Defendant’s liability under the claim. There was no reason for a civil trial to proceed in this suit on these grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other potential defences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For completeness, even though the parties focused on the moneylending and money laundering defences before me and below, I will briefly address other defences which arose in the Defendant’s pleadings in this suit:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in relation to the moneylending defence, the Defendant asserted that the loans given by the Plaintiff were for “exorbitant interest”.

</div>
</div> The Defendant did not explain the effect of this assertion anywhere in its pleadings. As there is no evidence of the Plaintiff’s not qualifying as an “excluded moneylender” under s 5(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act, the Loan was not the kind of transaction that the Moneylenders Act was meant to prohibit (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 at [138]–[139], where Quentin Loh J held that in the circumstances, a loan at an interest rate of 72% per annum was not prohibited by the Moneylenders Act). Moreover, the interest on the Loan claimed in this suit was at a rate of 10% per annum (see [8] above). I do not see how any <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence can arise from this, even when the Loan is considered in totality alongside the facility fee and the BT Loans which are not part of the subject matter of this suit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Related as well to the moneylending defence, the Defendant briefly argued that “the system and continuity” in which loans were made to the Defendant and Biomax Technologies evinced that the Plaintiff was carrying on an unregistered “business”, thus the loans ran afoul of s 31(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Business Names Registration Act 2014 (Act 20 of 2014).

</div> Section 31(1) however makes clear that s 31(2) only applies when a person carries on a business under a business name. Even if the Plaintiff were carrying on a business of moneylending, s 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) makes clear that an individual proprietor carrying on business under her own name is not required to be registered. There was no reasonable possibility of this defence succeeding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, it was pleaded in the defence that the SA was unenforceable for lack of consideration as the Plaintiff had not performed her obligations under the SIA.

</div> As stated at [35] above, this suit does not involve any claims in respect of terms added by the SA. The Plaintiff’s claims here were only in respect of the $5m principal and interest accruing on and after 6 January 2016, which were provided in the terms of the original CLA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, the Defendant, as mentioned briefly above, contended that the Plaintiff had breached the terms of the CLA by disbursing the Loan in three tranches on 6 January 2015, 14 January 2015 and 30 March 2015, when the monies should have been advanced in full on 6 January 2015.

</div> The Defendant’s conduct in accepting the second and third tranches of the Loan (and not repaying it even until this date), and in repaying the first $500,000 of interest under the CLA, made it beyond apparent that they had elected to affirm the contract in spite of any purported breach (see <span class="font-italic">Woo </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Wai and another v Chew Ai Hua Sandra and another appeal</span> [2014] 4 SLR 166 at [113]–[114] and <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 409 at [41]–[42] on the doctrine of waiver by election). Taking the Defendant’s case at its highest, it might only be able to avoid paying some of the interest accrued between 6 January 2015 and 30 March 2015, which had already been paid (at least in part) and did not in any event form part of the subject matter in this suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It was clear that none of these arguments amounted to <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and reasonable defences, raised any triable issues or provided any other reason for trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the above reasons and with due respect to the learned AR’s decision, I allowed the appeal and granted summary judgment for the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I ordered that costs here and below be fixed at $25,000 inclusive of disbursements, and paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chau Yee and Seet Yao Dong (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (Mallal &amp; Namazie) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
