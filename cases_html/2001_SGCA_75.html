<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    This is an appeal by the plaintiffs against a decision of the High

Court dismissing their claims against the defendants for breaches of copyright in certain artistic

works [sketches] relating to fire-rated glass doors and screens.

<p xmlns="">2.    All the parties to the proceedings were at the relevant times in the

business of manufacturing, sales and installation of fire-rated glass doors or glass screen systems.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    The third plaintiff (Glaverbel), a Belgium company, claims copyright to

certain artistic works set out in some preliminary sketches for a frame for fire-rated glass screens

(the Glaverbel works). The preliminary sketches were created in 1985 by Robert Vanderstukken

(Vanderstukken), an employee of the third plaintiff. The actual sketches were however not available

at the trial as they were either lost or destroyed but Glaverbel averred that the works were instead

illustrated in four test reports prepared for them by the University of Ghent in Belgium.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The first plaintiff (Flamelite) and second plaintiff (Flametech) claim

copyright to certain preliminary sketches for a frame for both fire-rated glass doors and screens.

The sketches were created in May 1991 by one Loke Gim Tay (Loke), an employee of Flametech. The

sketches were an improvement on the Glaverbel works, adapting the frame depicted in the Glaverbel

works to that for a fire-proof glass door. The sketches were likewise unavailable at the trial and a

set of shop drawings (Flamelite works) were tendered to evidence their contents.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    The third plaintiff (Glaverbel) was added as a party after the action had

been instituted. Although the trial judge made some comments on account of this, the parties in

their Cases have not pursued the matter. Accordingly, nothing turns on this.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">6.    Before the mid-eighties, nearly all the fire-rated glass doors were

imported, fully assembled from Europe. From the mid-eighties, Glaverbel licensed, inter alia, Flametech,

to produce steel frames for fire-rated glass screens. After Loke joined Flametech in 1991, he made

further improvements in the design of Glaverbels fire-rated doors and they are in the following

respects:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <b>Improving the frame:</b> Under the Glaverbel design, the glass panel was

  supported by calcium silicate boards screwed to the steel frame. However, they cracked slightly

  when screws were applied through them, and might not be able to take the stress of normal usage of

  a door, which swung frequently and was exposed to rain, mechanical impact and constant cleaning.

  Moreover, the exposed calcium silicate boards were unsightly and needed to be covered. Loke

  therefore added a steel-capping (or armour-capping) to the calcium silicate boards, which would

  protect it from the elements and increase its resistance to fire. It was also stronger as the

  weight of the glass was now borne by the steel capping as well as the steel core of the frame.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) <b>Connecting the door frame to the doorway frame using a hinge:</b> The

  main problem Loke faced was how to attach the door strap of the pivot hinge to the door frame. He

  could not fix it onto the calcium silicate board which was too brittle to take the stress of

  swinging action. He decided to attach the door strap to the steel core. He removed a portion of

  the calcium silicate padding, and reinforced the link by placing steel plates on it so that the

  pivot would not just slip out. As for the gap between the frame and the glass, he added

  intumescent strips in such a manner that they would expand and fill the gaps when a fire occurred.

  He then added door handles and lock sets, and extended the design to include a fixed screen to the

  whole design so that the glass door could be part of a larger glass faade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">7.    Based on the Flamelite works, Flametech proceeded to manufacture and sell

such fire-rated glass doors and screens. In October 1992, Loke resigned from Flametech, though

remaining its majority shareholder. He proceeded to set up Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd (Flamelite), the

first plaintiff.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    From January 1992 to May 1993, the first defendant (Lam) was engaged by

Flametech, as a sub-contractor to fabricate and install the fire-rated glass door and from December

1992 to June 1994, Lam was so engaged by Flamelite. For the purpose of enabling Lam to discharge his

task, shop drawings of the Flamelite works were furnished to Lam. The fourth defendant, Wu Kam Fai

(Wu), was from November 1992 to mid 1994 employed by Flamelite and his main responsibility was to

liaise with the various sub-contractors of Flamelite, including Lam. In June 1994, Flamelite

terminated the engagement of Lam.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    In August 1994, Lam and his wife, Sim Bee Hoon, the second defendant,

incorporated a company, Swissflame Pte Ltd (Swissflame), the third defendant. The majority shares in

Swissflame were held by Lam, who was also its controlling mind. It should be mentioned that the

plaintiffs action against the second defendant was subsequently discontinued.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    As stated before, the business of Swissflame was also in the manufacture

and sale of similar fire rated glass doors and screens. The fourth defendant, Wu, was from September

1995 employed by Swissflame as its Technical Services Manager, and his main duties were to market

Swissflames fire-rated glass doors and screens.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Present action</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">11.    In the present action, the plaintiffs alleged that Lam, Swissflame and Wu

have infringed their copyright which subsists in the Glaverbal works and the Flamelite works when

the latter produced their Swissflame fire-rated doors and screens. The plaintiffs claim that the

Swissflames framing system is substantially similar to or a near exact reproduction of the

plaintiffs framing system.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    Lam and Swissflame contended that while the general arrangement of the

components is similar, Swissflames framing system is not an exact reproduction nor is it a

slavish copy of the plaintiffs framing systems in terms of material and dimensions. Moreover, the

drawings contained only non-proprietary principles or methods of creating such fire-rated doors and

screens, and that the methods had been in common use in the industry for some 20 years already,

being largely dictated by functions. Vanderstukken admitted that Glaverbels design is elementary

and set out a simple principle of construction.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    As the preliminary sketches relating to the Glaverbel and the Flamelite

works were not produced, there was no way to know what was contained therein even though it is

alleged by the plaintiffs that annexures A and B to the Statement of Claim are

illustrative of what the preliminary sketches depicted. Furthermore, the defendants relied upon s 69

of the Copyright Act and asserted that these products do not infringe any copyright of the

plaintiffs as the products would not appear to persons, who are not experts in relation to such

doors, to be reproductions of the plaintiffs alleged artistic works.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    It should be mentioned that in the court below Flamelite and Flametech had

also alleged that Lam and Wu had committed breaches of confidence. However, in this appeal, the

claim based on breaches of confidence is no longer pursued by the two plaintiffs.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Agreed Facts</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">15.    During the course of the trial the parties also agreed, inter alia, to the

following. The preliminary sketches of Vanderstukken, although no longer to be found, are

nevertheless reflected in three University of Ghent Test Reports. Copyright in the preliminary

sketches subsists in Singapore by virtue of the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations,

1990 and 1996 and the copyright to the same vested in Glaverbel, as the employer of Vanderstukken.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    The preliminary sketches of Glaverbel were not seen by Loke or the

defendants. What Loke did in 1991, while in the employment of Flametech, was to use the Glaverbels

University of Ghest Test Reports (Nos. 5592, 6223 and 5673) as precedents, made changes and created

preliminary drawings of framework for a fire-rated glass and fixed screens. Loke, in turn, engaged a

free-lance draughtsman to reproduce the preliminary drawings into shop drawings. The preliminary

drawings of Loke were never seen by the defendants and could no longer be found, having been

destroyed or thrown away. The copyright in the preliminary drawings originally vested in Flametech.

In April 1994, Loke acquired Flametech and Flametech in turn assigned its copyright in the

preliminary drawings (the Flamelite works) to Flamelite.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    While Lam was engaged by the plaintiffs he was given the shop drawings of

the plaintiffs framework. Wu also had access to the plaintiffs shop drawings while he was

employed by Flamelite. There is, however, a dispute as to whether Loke told Wu that the shop

drawings were proprietary and confidential. Since joining Swissflame, Wu had quoted and sold

Swissflames fire-rated glass doors to various customers.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Decision below</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">18.    In relation to Glaverbel works, the judge below found that they consisted

really of only ideas. He also found that Glaverbal, having consented to the use of their drawings by

Flametech, was thus not entitled to mount their claim against the defendants because it would create

"unwitting duplication and double-counting."</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    In any case the judge found that there was no infringement of the

plaintiffs works because </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) The works related to a method of construction of a functional article. The

  works could not be proprietary and the court would not allow a claimant to establish a monopoly

  through a claim in copyright.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) The court accepted Lams explanation that in the course of his

  employment with Flamelite and Flametech, he had not seen any of the plaintiffs preliminary

  drawings but he had seen only some "rough hand drawn sketches" of Wu.</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) There was no substantial similarity between the Swissflame products and

  the plaintiffs works. The judge noted that besides differences as to materials and dimensions

  there were other differences in features between the plaintiffs works and the defendants

  product.</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Issues</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">20.    There are basically only two issues before us. The first is whether there

had been any infringement of the copyright works as the defendants did not exactly reproduce the

plaintiffs drawings. The second is whether the defence in s 69 is available to the defendants in

the circumstances of this case.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Locus of Glaverbel</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">21.    Before we proceed to examine the two issues there is a need for us to

briefly touch on two ancillary questions. The first is whether Glaverbel is entitled to bring the

present claim. The judge seemed to hold that, in view of Glaverbel having consented to Flametech and

Flamelite using its design, Glaverbel has, as a result, lost its right to sue for infringement. We

do not think that view is correct. The fact that Glaverbel has consented or licenced another to use

the design does not mean that Glaverbel has ceased to be the copyright owner of the design. Such a

licence cannot abrogate the rights of the copyright owner. Section 31(1) of the Copyright Act

expressly permits the copyright owner to grant licences to third parties. Granting of a licence to a

party does not mean granting a licence to the world at large. It would have been different if

Glaverbel had assigned its rights to Flametech/Flamelite.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    Turning next to the second ancillary question, the trial judge found that

the Glaverbel works and the Flamelite works involved an elementary or simple principle of

construction. While he thought they were mere ideas, he did not go on to expressly say that the

works are thereby incapable of acquiring copyright. We would reiterate that to obtain copyright it

is not necessary that the ideas or thoughts should be original or complex. Copyright protects the

expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. Mere simplicity does not mean that copyright is

precluded. We are reminded of what Megarry J stated in the following passage in <i>British Northrop

Ltd v Texteam Blackburn Ltd</i> [1974] RPC 57 (at p. 68):-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>It may indeed be that some thing may be drawn which cannot fairly be called a diagram or a

  drawing of any kind: a single straight line drawn with the aid of a ruler would not seem to me to

  be a very promising subject for copyright. But apart from cases of such barren and naked

  simplicity as that, I should be slow to exclude drawings from copyright on the mere score of

  simplicity. I do not think that the mere fact that a drawing is of an elementary and commonplace

  article makes it too simple to be the subject of copyright."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><br/>

Infringement</b></p>
<p xmlns="">23.    The primary concern of copyright is with the form in which an idea is

expressed. The requirement of originality in copyright law relates solely to the form in which the

work is expressed: <i>University of London Press Ltd v Barclays Finance Ltd</i> [1994] FSR 275. To

determine the issue of infringement, it is essential to bear in mind that in the Statement of Agreed

Facts the parties agreed that "Swissflames framing system is not an exact reproduction nor a

slavish copy of the plaintiffs framing system in terms of materials and dimensions". This is

further confirmed by a chart which the defendants submitted at the trial, where the Flamelite and

Glaverbel works were compared with Swissflames products, and which highlighted that differences

existed in relation to materials and dimensions.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    The plaintiffs pointed out that the defendants expert witnesses

acknowledged that there could be a variety of ways in which the fire-rated glass doors and screens

could be designed. Although these experts maintained that the Flamelite and Glaverbel works

comprised a common method of construction, they admitted that this was said from an engineering or

technical point of view. Interestingly, the defendants had adduced evidence of a variety of designs

adopted by other manufacturers. So the plaintiffs contended that it is not true that functional

reasons would require that the design of such doors/screens would all be the same. The plaintiffs

submitted that there is much room for creativity within the common method of construction. The

differences in materials, dimensions and features mentioned by the judge were trivial and do not

render the infringement any less so.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    The plaintiffs also emphasised the fact that the defendants had not really

explained how they arrived at the designs for their fire-rated glass doors and screens which are so

close to theirs. This, coupled with the fact that Lam and Wu had access to the shop drawings of the

Flamelite and Flametech products, strongly suggests that the defendants must have simply copied the

plaintiffs works.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    Under s 26(b)(i) of the Copyright Act, copyright confers upon the owner the

exclusive rights to, inter alia, reproduce an artistic work in any material form. An artistic work

in a two-dimensional form is deemed to be reproduced if a version of the work is produced in a three

dimensional form [s 15(3)(a)]. Under s 10(1), infringement is established as long as a substantial

part of the work is reproduced.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    To succeed in copyright infringement, the plaintiff must prove that copying

has taken place. Such proof can come in the form of establishing similarity combined with proof of

access to the plaintiffs works.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    We will first deal with the question of access as it can be disposed of

shortly. As Park J said in <i>A Fulton Co Ltd v Grant Barnett &amp; Co Ltd</i> [2001] RPC 257 at

284:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is rare that in intellectual property cases for there to be direct copying

  of someones else copyrights or designs. Plagiarists do their copying in secret. The courts

  proceed on the basis that a close similarity between the claimants design and the alleged

  infringing article, coupled with the opportunity for the alleged copier to have access to the

  claimants design or work, raises an inference of copying. It is then up to the defendant to

  rebut the inference by evidence which shows that the apparent similarity arose in some other way.

  In <i>Ibcos Computers Ltd v Barclay Finance Ltd </i>[1994] FSR 275 at page 297, Jacob J, said that

  "the concept of sufficient similarities shifting the onus to the defendant to prove

  non-copying is well recognised in copyright law." He added that he thought that the

  proposition "is not so much one of law as of plain rational thought."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">29.    In this case it is not in dispute that Lam had access to the shop drawings,

incorporating the Flamelite and Glaverbel works. He was then a sub-contractor fabricating the

fire-rated glass doors and screens for Flametech and Flamelite. Wu also had access to the shop

drawings of Flamelite. This is set out in 16 of the Statement of Agreed Facts. At all material

times, Wu knew or was familiar with the framing system used in relation to Flamelites fire rated

glass doors and screens.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    In this connection we ought to mention that the trial judge seemed to have

accepted Lams evidence in chief that he received instructions through some "rough hand

written sketches" and seemed to think that Lam did not have access to the shop drawings. But in

cross-examination Lam admitted that he was shown shop drawings of the plaintiffs. More importantly,

in 15 of the Statement of Agreed Facts it is stated that "in the course of his engagement as

a sub-contractor, Lam was given shop drawings of the plaintiffs frames." Thus, the judges

finding on this is not correct.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    It is not necessary that the copying should be consciously done.

Subconscious copying is just as infringing as is apparent from the following passage from <i>Copinger

&amp; Skone James on Copyright (14<sup>th</sup> Edn) Vol 1</i>, p.402.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"As already pointed out, since copyright is a proprietary right, ignorance

  is no defence to an infringement claim. If, therefore, the plaintiffs work has been copied from

  the plaintiffs, either directly or indirectly, the fact that the defendant was unaware that the

  work he was copying in this way existed, or was the plaintiffs or was the subject of copyright,

  or whether he thought he had a licence, provides no defence to a claim for primary infringement

  although in limited circumstances, it may affect the remedy.."</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Similarity</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">32.    We now turn to consider the question whether there is substantial

similarity between the Swissflame products and the two copyright works. In the Statement of Agreed

Facts the parties have set out their positions on the point as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The Plaintiffs claim that Swissflames framing system is substantially

  similar to or a near exact reproduction of the Plaintiffs framing system. Whilst the Defendants

  admit that the general arrangement of components is similar, Swissflames framing system is not

  an exact reproduction nor a slavish copy of the Plaintiffs framing system in terms of materials

  and dimensions. Further, the Defendants say that the frame design is a non-proprietary method of

  construction and is largely dictated by function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">33.    The trial judge, having examined the comparison chart tendered to court by

the defendants, came to the conclusion that:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In my view besides the differences as to dimensions, not all the features

  which appear in the plaintiffs product can be found in the defendants design. Besides,

  looking at the products from the standpoint of details, I am also in agreement with defendants

  counsel that the design alluded to by the plaintiffs has been demonstrably elementary and this

  aspect, insofar as the fourth plaintiffs designs are concerned, it had been conceded, albeit

  rather gingerly, by Vanderstukken (page 179 of the NE) that they were elementary. The addition of

  the much-talked about armour cladding by Loke too does not take their case any further as it is

  not claimed that that feature forms part of the infringement. In my determination, annexures A and

  B illustrate nothing but a non-proprietary principle or method of constructing the fire-rated

  glass doors and structural frames. I agree in this regard with the testimonial assertions by the

  defendants, that the method referred to involves the commonplace mounting of fire-resistant glass

  on a hollow steel section between fireproof calcium silicate boards. The steel section and calcium

  silicate boards are then joined to form a structural frame. The gap between the fire resistant

  glass and the calcium silicate board is filled using fireproof materials. I must further mention

  that I accept as valid the opinion of Associate Professor Chew that the framing system alluded to

  illustrate the simplest and most fundamental method of constructing a fire-rated glass door from

  an engineering point of view. I also accept as valid, Mr Kettles view that technically similar

  basic designs have been in existence for sometime and have been previously tested by others in

  conjunction with other proprietary types of insulating glass. One other observation which requires

  inclusion here is that any likeness or close resemblance between the plaintiffs and the

  defendants drawings is mainly owing to the function and functionality of the method which I

  accept as elementary."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">34.    Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that copyright protects against

copying and that the judge did not identify the features of the plaintiffs works which were

copied; neither did he rule that what the defendants had copied did not constitute a substantial

part of the plaintiffs works. The chart produced by the defendants set out the differences

between the Glaverbel works and the Flamelite works on the one hand and Swissflame works on the

other and those differences are quite insignificant.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    It is expressly provided in the Act that to constitute infringement what is

copied must be a substantial part of the artistic work. What would constitute substantial part was

stated rather eloquently by Buckley LJ in <i>Catnic Components Ltd &amp; Anor v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd

</i>[1979] FSR 609 at 223 as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I do not question the principle that in deciding whether what has been

  reproduced by an alleged infringer is a substantial part of the work allegedly infringed, one must

  regard the quality (that is to say the importance) rather than the quantity of the part reproduced

  (see <i>Ladbroke [Football] Ltd v William Hill [Football] Ltd</i> [1964] 1 WLR 273, per Lord Reid

  at p 276 and per Lord Pearce at p 293); but what is protected is the plaintiffs "artistic

  work" as such, not any information which it may be designed to convey. If it is said that a

  substantial part of it has been reproduced, whether that part can properly be described as

  substantial may depend upon how important that part is to the recognition and appreciation of the

  artistic work. If an artistic work is designed to convey information, the importance

  of some part of it may fall to be judged by how far it contributes to conveying that information,

  but not, in my opinion, by how important the information may be which it conveys or helps to

  convey. What is protected is the skill and labour devoted to making the artistic work

  itself, not the skill and labour devoted to developing some ideas or invention communicated or

  depicted by the artistic work. The protection afforded by copyright is not, in my judgment,

  any broader, as counsel submitted, where the artistic work embodies a novel or inventive

  idea than it is where it represents a commonplace object or theme."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">36.    In <i>Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd</i> [1964] 1 WLR 273, which was a case concerning literary work, Lord Evershed explained (at 283) the concept of

substantial reproduction as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">".. what amounts in any case to substantial reproduction  cannot be

  defined in precise terms but must be a matter of fact and degree. It will, therefore, depend not

  merely on the physical amount of the reproduction but on the substantial significance of that

  which is taken."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">37.    Lord Pearce, in the same case, also amplified the concept of substantial

reproduction in these terms:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Whether a part is substantial must be decided by its quality rather than

  its quantity. The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality would not normally be

  regarded as a substantial part of the copyright work and therefore will not be protected. For that

  which will not attract copyright except by virtue of its collocation will when robbed of that

  collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its

  reproduction to be an infringement."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">38.    This view was adopted by Plowman J in <i>Warwick Film Productions Ltd v

Eisinger</i> [1969] 1 Ch 508, a case where the plaintiff claimed that copyright in a book entitled

"The Trials of Oscar Wilde" had been infringed by a film script. However, the book in

question was in turn largely copied from an earlier publication. With respect to these copied

portions, Plowman J said:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" it had no originality and attracted copyright, as part of the whole

  book, only by reason of its collocation. When robbed of that collocation it does not, in my

  judgment, represent a substantial part of the copyright and so does not involve an infringement of

  it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">39.    A similar point also arose in the Australian Federal Court case of <i>A-One

Accessory Imorts Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd</i> (1996) 34 IPR 306, where Drummond J said (at

330):-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Where an original work comprises non-original material, whether pirated

  or not, and new material, the non-original material in the work attracts copyright protection only

  because of its collocation with the new material, so that, if the only part of such a composite

  work which is copied is the non-original component, once that is robbed of its collocation with

  the new material, it cannot be regarded as forming a substantial part of the entire work in which

  copyright subsists."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">40.    Of course, the existence of dissimilarities does not necessarily mean that

there is no infringement or that they destroy the notion of copying: see <i>Baazley Homes Ltd v

Arrowsmith</i> [1978] 1 NZLR 394. The question in each instance is whether the defendant has

incorporated into their plans and products, a substantial proportion of the plaintiffs plans. To

answer this question, the whole of the work must be considered and in this exercise the originality

and simplicity of the plan and its functional object must be borne in mind. All said, past cases are

only illustrative of judicial approach in the light of the prevailing facts.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    First, we will refer to an Australian High Court case relied upon by the

plaintiffs: <i>Hart v Edward Hot Water Systems</i> [1985] 61 ALR 251. The case concerned the

infringement of drawings relating to a solar energy hot water system. There Gibbs CJ said (at p.

255):-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Particular reliance was placed  in argument before us by counsel for

  the respondent on the differences in the dimensions of certain parts manufactured by the

  respondent and the dimensions of corresponding parts shown on the drawings, but I agree with

  Franki J that it does not follow that the relevant similarity does not exist merely because the

  dimensions of a part shown in a drawing and those of the corresponding three-dimensional part

  differ somewhat. Minor differences of that kind may be deliberately made for the very purpose of

  disguising the fact that copying has occurred. It is true that there were a good many differences

  in detail between the respondents products and the appellants drawings, although they seem

  to me to be comparatively minor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The question is not whether there are dissimilarities but whether the

  respondents products closely resembled the appellants drawings or a substantial part of

  them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">42.    A case very much on point is <i>Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall &amp; Anor</i>

(1990) 18 IPR 481, which concerned an alleged infringement of copyright in the design for a

simple-storey residential house. Pincus J delivering the judgment of the Federal Court of Australia

explained why there was no infringement in this manner:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The applicant is entitled to succeed if it can show that the house is a

  reproduction of the basic plan or of a substantial part of it. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the

  basic plan said to have been infringed creates a difficulty for the applicant. The simpler and

  more commonplace the copyright drawing, the more closely must the alleged infringer adhere to it,

  in order for liability to exist: <i>Kenrick and Co v Lawrence and Co</i> (1890) 25 QBD 99 at 102; <i>Ownit

  Homes Pty Ltd v D&amp;F Mancuso Investments Pty Ltd</i> (1988) AIPC 90-488 at 38,243  There

  are, of course, many houses of about the same size as those in issue here, and with similar

  facilities  If one adheres to the idea of having a roughly rectangular shape with all the rooms

  all on one level, there is only a limited number of ways in which the rooms can sensibly be

  arranged."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">43.    In <i>Catnic Components Ltd &amp; Anor v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd (supra) </i>the

question was whether certain steel lintels manufactured by the defendants were copies of drawings of

the plaintiffs and infringed the copyright in those drawings. The court found that the dimensional

similarities between the defendants lintel and the plaintiffs drawings were due to the

functions which the lintels were designed to perform and the normal dimensions of materials used in

the building of walls.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.    In <i>Kenrick &amp; Co v Lawrence &amp; Co</i> (1890) 25 QBD the copyright

on which infringement was alleged was a simple drawing of a hand holding a pencil. The defendants

drawing showed the hand to be in a different position. This slight change was held to be sufficient

to prevent an infringement from arising.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    Another highly illustrative case is <i>Politechnikas Ipari Szovelkezer v

Dallas Print Transfers Ltd</i> [1982] FSR 529 which concerned, inter alia, infringements of the

rights in the design for the container of the "Rubik Cubes" puzzle. The defendants

container was largely similar in that it was also cylindrical in shape, had a square indentation at

the top of the plastic lid and a recess in the base to take the corners of the cube. There were only

some differences in the square indentations and recesses. Dillon J held that copyright was not

infringed and said, at 542:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Another way of putting this point is that the drawings of the cover and

  base are very rudimentary, and where very rudimentary drawings are concerned there would be an

  infringement of copyright only if there were almost an exact reproduction of the drawings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">46.    Ultimately, the question of what is substantial is very much a question of

fact and degree on which difficult decisions would have to be made. Reverting to the instant case,

not only is there little originality in the copyright works, they are in fact simple and obvious,

bearing in mind the functional object to which they relate. It is not in question that the

Swissflame products do not copy exactly the copyright drawings. The material used is different; so

are some dimensions. On first impression, one may think that these variations are trivial and

insignificant. But they are not so, if we bear in mind the object the product is intended to serve.

Here, we are reminded of what Loke said. In working out the modifications to be made to the

Glaverbel works, Loke laid stress on the importance of the type of material used as well as the

thickness and depth of such material in order that the end product would be strong and would

effectively serve the intended purpose of the product. Thus, the variations in dimensions which

Swissflame introduced into their products cannot really be considered as inconsequential or merely

cosmetic.</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    Here, we note that the trial judge accepted the expert opinion of Associate

Professor Chew Chye Heng that the framing system of the plaintiffs was the "simplest and most

fundamental method of constructing a fire-rated glass door from an engineering point of view."

The plaintiffs sought to diminish the significance of this piece of evidence by highlighting the

fact that Assoc Prof Chew was looking at it from the engineering point of view. We are unable to see

how that contention can be made. We would have thought this evidence underscores the defendants

argument that the framing system of the plaintiffs is so basic that what was copied was not so much

the expression but the idea. Where the work is simple, the idea embodied in the work becomes so

closely identified with its expression that it is hard to separate the form of expression from the

idea. In such a case there should be a much closer degree of copying before infringement can occur.</p>
<p xmlns="">48.    On balance, we are not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong to have

come to the view that there was no substantial reproduction and thus no infringement. We are

inclined to agree with the trial judge that the general shape and layout of the Swissflame products

are dictated very much by functional requirements. In coming to this view, we have examined the two

models of the plaintiffs product which were produced to the court below.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Section 69 defence</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">49.    In the light of our decision above, the question whether the defence under

s 69 is available will be quite academic. However, we think it is necessary for us to clarify

certain views expressed by the trial judge.</p>
<p xmlns="">50.    Section 69, which is in <i>pari materia</i> with s 9(8) of the English

Copyright Act of 1956, provides that "the making of an object of any kind that is in 3

dimensions does not infringe the copyright in an artistic work that is in two dimensions if the

object would not appear to persons who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind to be a

reproduction of the artistic work."</p>
<p xmlns="">51.    The trial judge, in determining whether this defence was made out, took the

approach advanced by the defendants of merely comparing the external view of the product with the

copyright works. The defendants contended that the profiles and cross-sections of the defendants

frames would be concealed once the fire doors and screens are fabricated and installed. A non-expert

looking at the Swissflame products could not see the cross-section and hence would not be able to

tell that the Swissflame products were copied from the plaintiffs copyright drawings. On this

basis, the judge ruled that the non-expert defence was made out as the notional non-expert would not

be able to conclude that there had been copying from the copyright works.</p>
<p xmlns="">52.    The plaintiffs, relying upon <i>Solar Thompson Engineering Co Ltd &amp;

Anor v Barton</i> [1977] RPC 537, submit that the approach taken by the trial judge is wrong. There,

Lord Justice Buckley LJ said (at p.559):-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"If the notional unskilled observer postulated by section 9(8) should be

  treated as having a complete re-treaded cheek piece in his hand, it would, I think, be at least

  arguable that it would not appear to him that the rubber ring was necessarily a three-dimensional

  reproduction of the sectional drawing, for he would be unable to see what the contours of the

  rubber ring were on that side of it nearest to the steel ring; nor would he be able to see the

  contours of the hidden surfaces of the steel ring; nor could he be certain whether the surface of

  the rubber ring and the steel ring were actually in contact over the whole of that area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It seems to me, however, that, the drawing being a sectional drawing, the

  notional unskilled observer should be treated as having a sectioned cheek piece in his hand for

  the purposes of section 9(8)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">53.    We agree with Buckley LJ. To hold otherwise would mean that s 69 affords a

blanket defence to all to copy, so long as what has been copied cannot be seen from the external

appearance of the product. However, this is not to say that the trial judge (as the notional

non-expert) should repeat the process which he has gone through, with the assistance of experts and

other witnesses, in deciding whether there has been copying or not.</p>
<p xmlns="">54.    For section 69, the comparison is to be visual only though the judge, in

performing the task, must be entitled to compare the object with the drawings and must also be

credited with some ability to interpret design drawings: see <i>LB (Plastics) Ltd v Swish Products

Ltd</i> [1979] FSR 145. We also respectfully concur with the views expressed by Gibbs CJ in <i>SW

Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems</i> [1985] 61 ALR 251 that the term "persons

who are not experts in relation to objects of that kind" meant persons of reasonable

intelligence with sufficient ability to interpret drawings to enable them to perform their notional

function intelligently. Therefore, while a trial judge may do a cross-sectional comparison visually,

he is not to undertake a detailed dissection of the product.</p>
