In this suit (“the Suit”), Johnny claims a one-sixth share both in a property at River Valley Road (“RV Property”) and in the sale proceeds of a property at Barker Road (“BR Property”) which was sold in 2019. He claims that Pat held the properties on trust for the estate of their father (“Mr Hoie”) or mother (“Mdm Boey”) (collectively the “Parents”). Johnny further seeks an order that Pat render an account of all assets belonging to Mdm Boey in the possession of Pat and their late sister, Mdm Hoie Wai Fong (“Lucy”), as the executrices of Mdm Boey’s estate.

Mdm Boey subsequently transferred the RV Property to Wing Lee in 1970, in exchange for 45,000 shares in Wing Lee. Johnny claims that Wing Lee was founded by the Parents with the intention that it would be a family trust and that it was agreed among the family members that the Siblings would share equally in the family trust on the Parents’ demise. Hence, the Sisters breached that trust by transferring the RV Property to themselves when Wing Lee was wound up, instead of distributing it among the Siblings.

</div> Pertinently, Mdm Boey’s Will, wherein she stated that she was giving “[her] share” of the BR Property to the Sisters, is cogent evidence that Mdm Boey had regarded herself as a beneficial owner of the BR Property. In this regard, Johnny’s claim that Mdm Boey and the Sisters had “regarded Mr Hoie as the sole owner” of the property is baseless and contradicted by Pat’s testimony as well as the contents of Mdm Boey’s Will. In the round, I find the BR Property was purchased by Mdm Boey and the Sisters, and I accept Pat’s testimony that the three of them had contributed equally to the purchase price. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hence, Johnny’s claim for a share of the BR Property even under Mdm Boey’s estate fails. Even assuming that Mdm Boey’s share in the BR Property was capable of being devised under her will (given that there is a right of survivorship vis-à-vis the Sisters who were the remaining joint tenants after Mdm Boey’s demise), Mdm Boey had made it clear in her will that her share in that property would be left to the Sisters. Moreover, as the registered purchasers and owners of the BR Property, the presumption of indefeasibility of title of the property would apply; however, Johnny has not shown how the property was to be held on a resulting trust for Mr Hoie (<span class="font-italic">Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 at [14]). That the Sisters never informed Johnny when they subsequently sold the BR Property is irrelevant as they (being the sole beneficial owners after Mdm Boey’s demise) were entitled to dispose of it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 To conclude, Johnny’s claim for a share in the sale proceeds of the BR Property is without merit. His initial claim, that the BR Property should fall under Mr Hoie’s estate, is demolished by his own assertion that Mr Hoie could not give away what he did not own. Even if I accept Johnny’s case that the BR Property belonged entirely to Mdm Boey (which I do not), the fact remains that she had bequeathed whatever share she had in it to the Sisters by her will, which validity Johnny does not dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wing Lee and the RV Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I proceed to deal with Wing Lee and the RV Property, which was held by Wing Lee prior to its winding up.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Johnny’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I set out Johnny’s case based on his AEIC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Wing Lee was founded by the Parents “with the intention that it would be a family trust”, and that it would be a family-owned business with “all members of the family as shareholders and participating in the management of the business”. Although Mdm Boey purchased the RV Property around January 1965, it was fully paid by Mr Hoie. Wing Lee’s capital was raised by injecting the family assets in exchange for shares in the company. Hence, in July 1970, Mdm Boey transferred the RV Property to Wing Lee for 45,000 shares.

In the early 1980s, the Sisters started to control the company and conduct its affairs without heed to the rest of the family members, after the Parents became less involved in its day-to-day affairs. Around 30 November 1985, the Sisters procured the resignations of the Parents and Robert as directors; as well as the transfers of the shares owned by the Parents, Johnny, Robert and Tang to themselves (without the transferors’ knowledge or consent); such that the Sisters became Wing Lee’s only two shareholders and directors.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Second, quite aside from the question of the sustainability of such a claim as a matter of trust law, Johnny’s purported “family trust” being constituted via Wing Lee is premised on all members of the family participating in the management of the business. He thus asserts that although Lucy and Pat were the MD and a director of Wing Lee respectively, they were appointed for purely administrative reasons as they had “scant understanding” of the business and the real decision-makers were Mr Hoie and Robert. However, his assertions are entirely unsubstantiated. It is also unclear how Johnny could assert as such, as he never participated in the management of Wing Lee and did not have any personal knowledge of its affairs.

</div> Indeed, whilst maintaining that Mr Hoie was the real decision-maker, Johnny simultaneously claimed that in the early 1980s (which was around the time Lucy was appointed as MD), the Parents became less involved in the day-to-day affairs of Wing Lee and Mr Hoie’s health was deteriorating.

Rosalind stated that Pat, Robert and herself were assisting in Wing Lee, which was largely managed by Lucy, and Judy also attested to the same. Judy further stated, contrary to Johnny’s claim, that Robert did not manage the company but was merely involved in taking care of the delivery of goods.

</div> At that time, the only directors of Wing Lee were the Parents and Robert. Pat had resigned as a director in December 1976 and Lucy was not even a director. It is thus unlikely that either of the Sisters caused the removal of Johnny’s directorship or shareholding in Wing Lee in 1976 or 1978 respectively, when the Parents were still directors of Wing Lee and Lucy was not yet the MD (as she was only appointed in 1980). Hence, Johnny’s assertion, that either Lucy or Pat had caused his<span class="font-italic"> </span>shares to be transferred out, is not borne out by the evidence. If at all, is more likely that Mr Hoie had caused the redistribution of the shares, which Johnny knew and agreed to at the material time, because Mr Hoie had decided to divide the family business, such that Johnny would own Luen Wah but relinquish his rights to Wing Lee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Then, in 1980, further shares were issued to Mdm Boey, Robert, the Sisters and Rosalind, at the time when the Parents and Robert were Wing Lee’s directors. This brought the total shares in Wing Lee to 157,000 shares.

</div> By this time, Johnny was no longer a director or shareholder of Wing Lee. By December 1985, all the 157,000 shares were in the Sisters’ names, and they also became the only two directors. Again, it is unlikely that the shares were transferred without the respective transferor’s knowledge or consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Whilst Rosalind, who was the company secretary, was unable to recall how the share transfers were effected in the 1970s and 1980s, she repeatedly stated that she had filed documents to effect the share transfers, and that the documents must have been signed by the transferors (including Johnny) for the transfers to be effected. She also testified that she must have had taken instructions from Mr Hoie in this regard.

</div> I accept Rosalind’s testimony and find her to be a truthful witness. Although she could not now recollect many events, it must be viewed in the context that she is 83 years old and has come to court to attest to matters that happened over 30 to 40 years ago. I further consider it most unlikely that the then relevant authority (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Registry of Companies and Businesses) would have accepted the registration of any share transfer without some proof of authorisation by the transferor, although searches with the now Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) do not show the lodgement of such transfer forms. However, that ACRA does not have a record of such forms which pertain to events in the 1970s and 1980s does not mean that the forms did not then exist. I reiterate – the events of the transfers took place over 30 to 40 years ago. Ultimately, Johnny bears the burden of proving his assertion that all the share transfers (and particularly those pertaining to him and the Parents) were made without the respective transferor’s knowledge or consent. However, he has not satisfied this burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I next deal with Judy’s testimony that she did not know if she had signed any document to transfer her shares away. Judy explained in court that she did not know she had shares in the first place. However, she accepted how her father had dealt with the shares in Wing Lee because none of the Siblings had paid for the shares issued to them, and Mr Hoie had further told her that he intended to leave his assets to the Sisters because he could trust them to look after Mdm Boey when he passed on.

</div> I find Judy to be a forthright witness, who readily accepted the Parents’ wishes, even if she had received a smaller share of their estate compared to some of the other Siblings. Regardless, Judy’s testimony (regarding <span class="font-italic">her</span> own shares) does not assist Johnny’s case that <span class="font-italic">Mr Hoie and Mdm Boey</span> did not know about or consent to the transfer of <span class="font-italic">their </span>shares in Wing Lee. On the contrary, Rosalind attested that the Parents knew of the transfers of their respective shares because they wanted to give their shares to the Sisters. Rosalind also accepted her shares being transferred to the Sisters, which would have been at Mr Hoie’s behest.

</div> I accept that she genuinely could not recall the details of the share allotments and how the transfers came to be, given that the events happened over 30 years ago. She was candid in her testimony in court and did not attempt to embellish her evidence to support her case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Ultimately, the burden is on Johnny to prove his allegation that his or the Parents’ shares in Wing Lee were transferred away, or that the Sisters had caused these transfers to be made, without the transferors’ knowledge or consent. I find that he has not discharged this burden. At the time his shares were transferred out in 1978, neither of the Sisters were directors of Wing Lee, and it was more likely than not that he knew of and consented to his shares being transferred from him because this was the result of Mr Hoie restructuring the family businesses to give Luen Wah to Johnny and for Johnny to have no further share or participation in Wing Lee.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In conclusion, I find Johnny’s claim of a “family trust” in Wing Lee to be without merit. Johnny’s claim for a one-sixth share in the RV Property based on the purported “family trust” or based on his or the Parents’ previous shareholdings in Wing Lee is thus not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As Johnny has failed to show that the Sisters had caused all the shares in Wing Lee to be transferred to themselves without the knowledge or consent of the respective shareholders, his claim that they had breached various fiduciary duties and thus should render an account of Mdm Boey’s estate is also dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I add for completeness that upon Wing Lee’s winding up, all the shares belonged to the Sisters and hence, the RV Property (which had belonged to Wing Lee) would have belonged to them. On Lucy’s demise, she had by her will devised her share in the RV Property to Pat, who thus became the sole beneficial owner of the property. In this regard, it is undisputed that Lucy’s will was read in Johnny’s presence in September 2020 shortly after Lucy’s demise; Johnny also knew that Pat was the executrix of Lucy’s estate and had obtained probate for the estate.

Thus, the Sisters were entitled to all the sale proceeds when they sold the BR Property.

When Wing Lee was wound up, the Sisters, being the only shareholders, were entitled to all the assets therein including the RV Property, which then ultimately belonged to Pat on Lucy’s demise. Thus, Johnny’s claim to a share in the RV Property and any rental proceeds therefrom is also dismissed.

He even claimed that the Sisters had arranged for Mdm Boey to execute a will under suspicious circumstances, although he did not further pursue this claim. His claims in the Suit were made long after his Parents had passed on, although he knew of their respective wills shortly after their demise. To support his claims, he conveniently made various assertions about his Parents (that they had set up a “family trust”; and that Mdm Boey had no means to purchase the BR Property or RV Property, such that Mr Hoie must have purchased them), about Robert (that he was the real decision-maker in Wing Lee; and that he told Johnny that their mother and the Sisters did not pay for the BR Property), and about Lucy (that she was merely MD of Wing Lee in name; and that she had caused the transfer of his and the other family members’ shares to the Sisters without their knowledge), when they were no longer alive to reply to these assertions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In contrast, although Judy and Rosalind also received less from the Parents, they accepted the Parents’ wishes. They accepted that the Sisters obtained a larger share of Mr Hoie’s estate because they could be trusted to look after Mdm Boey upon Mr Hoie’s passing. It is undisputed that the Sisters continued to live with Mdm Boey at the BR Property after Mr Hoie’s passing, whilst Johnny never lived there or assisted in caring for Mdm Boey.
