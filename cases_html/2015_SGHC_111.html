        Vinodh Coomaraswamy J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff in this suit has applied for leave
                    to amend its statement of claim. Its application comes after trial and after the
                    parties have exchanged written closing submissions, but comes just before the
                    parties present their oral closing submissions. The defendant resists the
                    plaintiff’s application. It argues that granting leave at this late stage
                    will cause it prejudice for which it cannot be compensated by
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having heard the parties’ submissions, I
                    have granted the plaintiff leave to make its amendments. I have done so for four
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The amendments serve merely to: (a)
                        incorporate into the pleadings two undisputed facts known at all times to
                        both sides and which they have both dealt with at trial; and (b) adopt as an
                        alternative element of the plaintiff’s case the defendant’s
                        pleaded case on liability while putting in issue certain elements of the
                        defendant’s case on quantum.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     The only new issues which the amendments raise are issues
                        of law, not of fact. The amendments therefore do not alter the
                        plaintiff’s case in any way which is unfair to the defendant even
                        though they come after the conclusion of the evidential
                    phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff
                        does not seek to reopen the evidential phase of this suit to adduce or
                        elicit evidence to support any of its amendments. It is prepared for its
                        amended case to stand or fall on the evidence already adduced. I have also
                        allowed the defendant an opportunity to address me on any specific points
                        arising from the amendments which it says necessitates reopening the
                        evidential phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     I have ordered the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the costs of and
                        incidental to this application and the costs thrown away by the amendments.
                        These costs include not only the defendant’s costs associated with the
                        application itself but also the defendant’s consequential costs of
                        responding to and dealing with the plaintiff’s amendments. The latter
                        costs, in turn, will include a reasonable amount for costs which the
                        defendant reasonably incurs in reopening the evidential phase, if the
                        defendant is able to establish that it needs to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I have also rejected a belated submission by the
                    defendant – made by way of a request to present further arguments –
                    that I should not have granted leave to the plaintiff to amend its statement of
                    claim because the relevant limitation period has expired. I do not consider
                    there is any merit in that submission, on whatever basis it may have been
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant has appealed against my decision.
                    I now set out my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties and their contractual relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant in this suit is Multistar Holdings
                    Limited (“Multistar”). Multistar is the parent company of a group
                    of companies in the engineering and construction business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff in this suit is Geocon Piling
                    &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (“Geocon”). Geocon is a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary of Multistar. Until Geocon went into compulsory liquidation in 2006,
                    it was the specialist piling sub-contractor in the Multistar group of
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In 2001, the Land Transport Authority awarded a
                    contract known as C421 to SembCorp Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd
                    (“SembCorp”). SembCorp’s scope of work under C421 was to
                    construct a part of the Kallang Paya Lebar Expressway (“KPE”) from
                    the East Coast Parkway (“ECP”) to Nicoll Highway. Its scope of
                    work included, but was not limited to, the bored piling at all locations along
                    this stretch of the KPE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       SembCorp subcontracted to Multistar the entire
                    scope of its bored piling works under C421. The SembCorp/Multistar subcontract
                    was a lump sum contract subject to variations. Its value was
                $27.48m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Multistar subcontracted the entire scope of its
                    work under the SembCorp/Multistar subcontract to Geocon. The Multistar/Geocon
                    subcontract stipulated a price of $26m, but was otherwise expressly on the same
                    terms as the SembCorp/Multistar subcontract. Therefore, it too was a lump sum
                    contract subject to variations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Geocon then subcontracted its entire scope of
                    work under the Multistar/Geocon subcontract to Resource Piling Pte Ltd. The
                    nominal value of the Geocon/Resource Piling subcontract was $18.7m. Multistar
                    and Geocon accounted for the $7.3m difference between this value and the value
                    of the Multistar/Geocon subcontract as a project management fee to be paid by
                    Multistar to Geocon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multistar and Resource Piling bypassed Geocon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Given this chain of subcontracts, the flow of
                    progress claims and payments under last two subcontracts ought to have been
                    between Multistar and Geocon on their subcontract; and between Geocon and
                    Resource Piling on their subcontract. But Multistar and Resource Piling treated
                    each other from the outset as direct contractual counterparties. They bypassed
                    Geocon entirely. What actually happened was that Resource Piling presented its
                    progress claims directly to Multistar and Multistar made its progress payments
                    directly to Resource Piling. As Multistar made each of these payments, Multistar
                    would back charge that payment to Geocon and Geocon would recognise an
                    indebtedness to Multistar in the amount of that payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     From time to time, Geocon rendered its own
                    progress claims to Multistar under the Multistar/Geocon subcontract. These
                    progress claims included Geocon’s costs. Geocon, of course, did not
                    actually incur any actual direct costs in performing its subcontract. Multistar
                    was paying these costs directly to Resource Piling on Geocon’s behalf.
                    These costs claimed by Geocon were therefore incurred only in a notional sense.
                    Geocon included these notional costs in its progress claims to Multistar purely
                    to be in a position to set them off against its back charged indebtedness to
                    Multistar, leaving only the project management fee due from Multistar to
                    Geocon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Litigation in 2004 with Resource Piling</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Resource Piling’s work did not proceed
                    smoothly. It encountered especially difficult soil conditions at a location
                    known as the ECP South Location. By late 2002, Resource Piling had stopped all
                    work at that location. Despite this, Resource Piling continued its work at other
                    locations during 2003 and into 2004. By the end of April 2004, however, Resource
                    Piling had stopped all work at all locations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Multistar took the position at that time that
                    it was Multistar (and not Geocon) who was Resource Piling’s contractual
                    counterparty. In April 2004, Multistar commenced proceedings against Resource
                    Piling alleging that it had abandoned the bored piling works in repudiatory
                    breach of a contract between Multistar and Resource Piling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Resource Piling rejected Multistar’s
                    position. It responded by commencing suit against both Geocon and Multistar. Its
                    case was that its contract was with Geocon (not Multistar), that it had a
                    contractual right to stop work because Geocon was in repudiatory breach of the
                    Geocon/Resource Piling subcontract and that Geocon was therefore liable to it in
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     All of this litigation was eventually
                    consolidated and tried together before Tay Yong Kwang J. I shall refer to it as
                    “the 2004 litigation”. Resource Piling won the 2004 litigation.
                    Tay J held that Resource Piling’s subcontract was with Geocon and not with
                    Multistar. He found Geocon to be in repudiatory breach of contract. He adjudged
                    it liable to pay damages to Resource Piling. He assessed those damages in the
                    net sum of $3.3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A liquidator takes control of Geocon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Geocon did not pay its judgment debt to
                    Resource Piling. As a result, in June 2006, Resource Piling secured an order
                    placing Geocon in compulsory liquidation on grounds of insolvency. Mr Tam Chee
                    Chong was then appointed – and remains today – Geocon’s
                    liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Multistar group captured all costs
                    ultimately referable to the Multistar/Geocon subcontract in two cost ledgers
                    maintained in its computerised accounting books and records. These two cost
                    ledgers are known as GC1063 and GC1077. Broadly speaking, GC1063 captures
                    Geocon’s costs incurred from the very outset of the Multistar/Geocon
                    subcontract in January 2002 until the end of April 2004,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> when Resource Piling stopped all work.
                    GC1077 captures costs incurred from the beginning of May 2004 until the end of
                        2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The liquidator, as is his duty, has taken
                    control of Geocon’s accounting books and records. Having reviewed them,
                    and having taken expert advice, he has formed the view that Multistar still owes
                    Geocon money under the Multistar/Geocon subcontract. He has therefore caused
                    Geocon to bring this suit against Multistar. The net recoveries in this suit
                    will go ultimately to benefit Geocon’s creditors. Those creditors include,
                    of course, Resource Piling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This background makes it clear that, although
                    this suit is in form an action brought by a wholly-owned subsidiary against its
                    parent, it is in substance a suit brought on behalf of the creditors of an
                    insolvent company against those who own it and who previously controlled it. I
                    make this observation not because there is anything wrong in any of this.
                    Multistar and Geocon are separate legal entities and have separate sets of
                    debtors and creditors. Each is entitled in law to pursue its own interests,
                    whether before liquidation or after liquidation. I make this observation only to
                    explain why Multistar knows far more than Geocon itself about the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract and about the manner in which Geocon accounted in
                    its books and records for the financial aspects of the subcontract (see,
                        <em>eg</em>, [32] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Geocon sues Multistar in 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Geocon’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The liquidator ultimately quantified
                    Multistar’s debt to Geocon at $10.9m. Geocon demanded payment of $10.9m
                    from Multistar in 2009. No payment was forthcoming. Geocon therefore commenced
                    this suit in 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Geocon’s case on liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Geocon’s original case on liability in
                    this suit is that, following Resource Piling’s exit in April 2004, Geocon
                    took over and completed Resource Piling’s unfinished work on the basis
                    that Multistar would reimburse Geocon for all costs incurred thereby.
                    Geocon’s case is that it is therefore entitled to recover these costs in
                    full and that Multistar’s liability to Geocon is not limited by the $26m
                    lump sum price stipulated in the Multistar/Geocon subcontract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Geocon’s case on quantum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Geocon’s statement of claim pleads three
                    claims against Multistar which together total the $10.9m which Geocon demanded
                    of Multistar in 2009. I need give only the briefest summary of each claim for
                    present purposes. In doing so, I have rounded off the figures, even though this
                    results in some small discrepancies in the arithmetic. I have also left out of
                    account all amounts added or payable for goods and services tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Geocon’s first claim against Multistar
                    is for the sum of $1.8m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> being the sum due to Geocon on
                    GC1063 which is said to remain unbilled and unpaid. Geocon’s second claim
                    is for the sum of $6.75m,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> being the total due to
                    Geocon on GC1077, which is said to remain unbilled and unpaid. Geocon’s
                    third claim is an assertion that it is entitled to recover from Multistar the
                    amount of $2.3m,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> being an amount
                    overcharged by Multistar. Geocon’s total claim of $10.9m is the sum of
                    these three claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In addition to these three claims, Geocon
                    advances a fourth claim. The fourth claim is that Geocon has never, as alleged
                    by Multistar, agreed to bear a discount of $1.8m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> out of a total
                    discount of $1.9m which Multistar agreed to give SembCorp under the
                    SembCorp/Multistar contract. Geocon’s fourth claim is not a component of
                    the total of $10.9m which Geocon claims in this suit. That is because the fourth
                    claim is not a claim in the true sense of the word. It is, in fact, the
                    pre-emptive rejection of an anticipated set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multistar’s defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Multistar’s defence to Geocon’s
                    claim runs along two lines.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Limitation defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Multistar’s threshold point is that all
                    of Geocon’s claims are time-barred under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act
                    (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), the causes of action having accrued more than 6 years
                    before these proceedings were commenced. If Multistar succeeds on this point, of
                    course, Geocon’s claim fails entirely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Two alternative claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In case Geocon’s claims are held not to
                    be time-barred, Multistar sets up two alternative claims against Geocon, both as
                    a defence and as a counterclaim. Both claims assert that it is actually Geocon
                    who owes Multistar money. The first claim is that Geocon owes Multistar
                        $0.86m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The second claim is that
                    Geocon owes Multistar $0.66m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Both of these alternative claims rest on the
                    same fundamental point: Multistar never agreed to pay Geocon on the
                    reimbursement basis for any of the work ultimately referable to the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract. The result, Multistar says, is that Geocon was at
                    all times contractually bound to deliver its entire scope of works under the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract at a lump sum price of $26m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> subject only to the
                    accepted variations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Multistar’s first alternative claim is
                    not material for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Multistar’s second alternative claim
                    adopts as its starting point the statement in Geocon’s own audited
                    accounts that Multistar owed Geocon $0.05m as at 31 December 2005. Multistar
                    then deducts from that figure additional costs of $0.71m which it says it
                    incurred after 31 December 2005 and which it claims to be entitled to back
                    charge to Geocon. Multistar thus arrives at the sum of $0.66m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> which Geocon is said to owe
                    Multistar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The figure of $0.05m which appears in
                    Geocon’s audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 is arrived
                    at by taking the lump sum value of the Multistar/Geocon subcontract, adding the
                    value of all variations accepted by Multistar and then deducting all of
                    Multistar’s actual payments to Geocon as well as the $1.8m discount (see
                    [25] above) and certain back charges, set offs and cross claims asserted by
                    Multistar. The detailed calculations which underlie this figure of $0.05m are
                    not now material. It suffices to say that Multistar knows precisely how this
                    figure is calculated even if Geocon – or more accurately, its liquidator
                    – does not. Thus, even though this figure is taken from Geocon’s
                    audited accounts and is therefore ostensibly Geocon’s figure, it is
                    Multistar and not Geocon who first pleaded the detailed underlying
                    calculations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Only one of these underlying calculations is
                    material for present purposes. If one starts with the lump sum value of the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract plus accepted variations, and one then deducts only
                    Multistar’s <em>actual payments</em> to Geocon
                    – thus leaving out of account the $1.8m discount as well as all of the
                    back charges, set-offs and cross-claims asserted by Multistar – the result
                    is that Multistar owes $6.8m to Geocon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Geocon’s reply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In its reply, Geocon pleads that even if,
                    contrary to Geocon’s primary case, its work under the Multistar/Geocon
                    subcontract was not done on the reimbursement basis, Multistar nevertheless owes
                    it the intermediate figure of $6.8m (see [33] above). The effect of this plea is
                    implicitly to accept that Multistar’s liability to Geocon is limited by
                    the lump sum price under the Multistar/Geocon subcontract plus variations but to
                    assert that Multistar has no right to deduct anything from that amount other
                    than its actual payments to Geocon. As an alternative, Geocon claims in its
                    reply the sum of $0.05m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    plus any of the discounts, back charges, set-offs or cross-claims which are
                    implicit in that sum and which the court determines that Multistar is not
                    entitled to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although Geocon’s reply and defence to
                    counterclaim is a single composite pleading, the averments I have summarised at
                    [34] above are found only in Geocon’s reply. Geocon does not repeat these
                    averments or incorporate them by reference in its defence to counterclaim. But
                    it is clear from the general tenor of Geocon’s composite pleading that
                    Geocon relies upon and pleads these averments not only by way of reply to
                    Multistar’s defence but also by way of defence to Multistar’s
                    counterclaim. Any submission that this pleading does not suffice for Geocon to
                    rely on these averments as a defence to Multistar’s counterclaim would be
                    the height of arid technicality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This suit was tried before me over 7 days in
                    the course of 2014. Geocon adduced evidence from four witnesses of fact, two of
                    whom gave evidence upon subpoena, and one expert witness. Multistar adduced
                    evidence from two witnesses of fact and one expert witness. Following the
                    conclusion of the evidential phase, the parties in due course filed their
                    written closing submissions. A date was then fixed for the parties to attend
                    before me for oral submissions. Before I could hear the oral submissions,
                    however, Geocon filed the present application seeking leave to amend its
                    statement of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Points taken by Multistar in closing submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Geocon’s application to amend its
                    statement of claim is prompted by two points made in Multistar’s written
                    closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     First, Multistar submits<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that Geocon’s
                    alternative claim for $6.8m (see [33] and [34] above) must fail on the pleadings
                    alone. The effect of this alternative claim is to adopt Multistar’s case
                    that the Multistar/Geocon subcontract is a lump sum contract, and is subject to
                    a lump sum price of $26m. This, Multistar submits, is inconsistent with
                    Geocon’s case advanced in its statement of claim. That case is that Geocon
                    is entitled to be paid for the cost of completing Resource Piling’s
                    unfinished work on the reimbursement basis. Multistar submits that a plaintiff
                    cannot, as a matter of pleading, advance two alternative claims which are wholly
                    inconsistent with each other, let alone advance one claim in its statement of
                    claim and the wholly inconsistent alternative claim only in its reply. Multistar
                    therefore argues that Geocon’s alternative claim for $6.8m must
                    necessarily be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The second point which Multistar raises is
                    that Geocon has failed to adduce any evidence to support its pleaded case that
                    Multistar engaged Geocon in April 2004 to complete Resource Piling’s
                    unfinished work on the reimbursement basis. This submission arises, at least in
                    part, from a disconnect between Geocon’s pleaded case that that engagement
                    took place in April 2004 and the evidence which Geocon pleads in support of that
                    case. I set out the background necessary to understand this submission at
                    [52]–[59] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Geocon applies to amend its pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Geocon’s amendments to its statement of
                    claim respond to both of these points made by Multistar’s. They fall into
                    two broad categories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The first category of amendments acknowledges
                    for the first time in Geocon’s pleadings that Resource Piling ceased work
                    in two stages (see [13] above). These amendments therefore draw a distinction
                    between Resource Piling ceasing work at the ECP South Location at the end of
                    2002 and at all other locations in April 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second category of amendments puts forward
                    four additional alternative claims against Multistar. These additional
                    alternative claims are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     Geocon’s first additional
                        alternative claim is for the sum of $8.6m. This amounts to nothing more than
                            withdrawing<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> its third claim.
                        Thus, Geocon derives the $8.6m simply by adding its first claim to its
                        second claim and omitting its third claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     Geocon’s second additional alternative
                        claim pleads that Multistar is indebted to it in the sum of $0.05m (see [31]
                        above). That figure is Multistar’s indebtedness to Geocon as recorded
                        in Geocon’s own accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005. This
                        claim is founded on the same basis as Multistar’s counterclaim for
                        $0.66m but rejects Multistar’s entitlement to deduct $0.71m (see [31]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     Geocon’s third additional alternative claim transplants without any
                        change its claim for $6.8m (see [34] above) from its reply into its
                        statement of claim. Geocon thus claims in its statement of claim that
                        Multistar is indebted to it in the sum of $6.8m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     Geocon’s fourth alternative
                        claim pleads expressly, in the body of the statement of claim, the content
                        of an existing prayer that Geocon’s damages be
                assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Of these four additional alternative claims,
                    it is only the second and third which are material. These two now advance in
                    Geocon’s statement of claim the alternative case that Geocon is entitled
                    to be paid on the lump sum basis. That case has been found until now only in its
                    reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     To explain why I have granted Geocon leave to
                    make the amendments to its statement of claim in both categories, I begin by
                    setting out the principles of law which I have applied in exercising my
                    discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Geocon’s application for leave to amend</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on amending pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the typical case, a party will be allowed
                    to amend its pleadings if the amendments enable the real issues between the
                    parties to be tried and will not cause any prejudice to the opposing party for
                    which it cannot be compensated by costs. As the Court of Appeal said in
                        <em>Wright Norman and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp
                        Ltd</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 640 at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that an amendment which would enable the real issues
                        between the parties to be tried should be allowed subject to penalties on
                        costs and adjournment, if necessary, unless the amendment would cause
                        injustice or injury to the opposing party which could not be compensated for
                        by costs or otherwise: see <em>Cropper v Smith</em>
                        (1884) 26 Ch D 700; <em>Tildesley v Harper</em> (1878)
                        10 Ch D 393. This is so even though the omission was caused by carelessness
                        or the application for amendment was made very late in the day: per Brett MR
                        in <em>Clarapede &amp; Co v Commercial Union
                            Association</em> [1883] 32 WR 262 at 263.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The present case is not, however, the typical
                    case. Geocon’s application to amend comes at a very late stage. It comes
                    after a seven-day trial at which both parties adduced extensive factual and
                    expert evidence. It comes after the parties have exchanged their principal and
                    reply written closing submissions. It comes while the parties are waiting for an
                    opportunity to make oral submissions. Further, the amendments have been proposed
                    to meet and deflect two specific attacks on Geocon’s case which Multistar
                    set out in its closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Geocon submits that even though the evidential
                    phase in this suit has closed, I ought to grant it leave to make these
                    amendments. Geocon does not seek to reopen the evidential phase of the trial to
                    adduce or elicit further evidence to support the amendments. Geocon argues that
                    the amendments do not change its case in any way which takes Multistar by
                    surprise. Multistar can be readily compensated by costs for any prejudice it may
                    suffer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Multistar rejects this
                submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Geocon relies for its submission on <em>Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 2 SLR(R) 594 (“<em>Digilandmall.com</em>”). In that case, VK Rajah JC (as he then

                    had concluded. He held that the lateness of the application was not
                    determinative in itself but was only one factor for the court to consider in
                    exercising its wide discretion to allow amendment. The overarching consideration
                    was whether, in all the circumstances, the amendment operated unfairly to the
                    opposing party. Thus, he said at [84]–[88]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84    It is axiomatic that
                            a court will generally be cautious if not reluctant to effect any
                            amendments once the hearing has commenced; even more so once the
                            evidential phase of the proceedings has been completed. Lord Griffiths
                            in <em>Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd</em> [1987]
                            AC 189 at 220 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]o allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from
                            allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful
                            defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different
                            defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    Having stated the
                            general rule, it is imperative that the rationale underlying this
                            approach be understood. Rules of court which are meant to facilitate the
                            conduct of proceedings invariably encapsulate concepts of procedural
                            fairplay. They are not mechanical rules to be applied in a vacuum,
                            devoid of a contextual setting. Nor should parties regard pleadings as
                            assuming an amoeba-like nature, susceptible to constant reshaping. Rules
                            and case law pertaining to amendments are premised upon achieving
                            even-handedness in the context of an adversarial system
                        by:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    ensuring that the parties apprise each other
                                and the court of the essential facts that they intend to rely on in
                                addressing the issues in controversy or dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    requiring that an amendment should be attended
                                to in the usual course of events, at an early stage of the

                                or caused to opposing parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    requiring careful consideration whether any
                                amendments sought at a late stage of the proceedings will cause any
                                prejudice to the opposing party. Prejudice is to be viewed broadly
                                to encompass any injustice and embraces both procedural and
                                substantive notions;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    recognising that while a costs award against
                                the party seeking late amendments can frequently alleviate any
                                inconvenience caused, this may not always be
                            appropriate;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    taking into account policy considerations that
                                require finality in proceedings and proper time management of the
                                courts’ resources and scheduling. From time to time there will
                                be cases where this is an overriding consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In short, where does the justice reside? There is constant tension in our
                        legal system to accommodate the Janus-like considerations of fairness and
                        finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86    In cases where the
                            facts raised in the proposed amendments have been addressed during the
                            evidence and submissions and, particularly, where the opposing side has
                            also had an opportunity to address the very same points, there can
                            hardly ever be any real prejudice. The pleadings, in such instances,
                            merely formalise what is already before the court. As a matter of
                            fairness, allowing amendments at a late stage should usually go hand in
                            hand with granting leave to the other party to adduce further evidence,
                            if necessary. Altogether different considerations may arise if a party,
                            at a late stage, seeks through an amendment to adduce further evidence
                            to support that same amendment. A court is not likely to take a
                            sympathetic view of such manner of amendment. The point is, there is a
                            chasm between a clarification amendment and a new or distinct issue
                            being raised at a later stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    ... The essential point remains: will prejudice be caused and/or are
                            any policy considerations called into play. <em>The
                                essence is not so much in the nature of the amendment but rather in
                                the consequences flowing from any amendment to the
                                pleadings</em>. There is often, but not inexorably, a
                            co-relationship between the timing when the amendment is sought and the
                            adverse consequences for the other party. The later the amendment, the
                            greater the adverse
                            consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    The fact that
                            the amending party has been tardy or even negligent is a factor that a
                            court can (and in some egregious cases, should) take into account but
                            this is by no means a decisive factor (<em>cf Ketteman v
                                Hansel Properties</em>). The current general approach is
                            correctly stated in Professor Jeffrey Pinsler’s <em>Singapore Court Practice 2003</em> (LexisNexis, 2003) at para

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Geocon’s original case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Geocon’s original case is that Multistar

                    on the reimbursement basis. The heart of Geocon’s claim is set out in
                    paragraphs 11, 12 and 14(ii) of its statement of claim. The first category of
                    amendments affects each of these paragraphs. But none of these amendments
                    changes the fundamental nature of this aspect of Geocon’s
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Paragraphs 11, 12 and 14(ii) of Geocon’s
                    unamended statement of claim read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Sometime around April 2004, disputes arose between

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I should say something now about Mr

                    managing director of Multistar. He was the Multistar group’s project
                    director for its work for SembCorp on the KPE. He signed the SembCorp/Multistar
                    subcontract on behalf of Multistar.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He also signed the letter of award for the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract on behalf of Multistar. At the same time, he was a
                    director of Geocon. Although he was not Geocon’s managing director, he
                    signed the letter of award<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> for the Geocon/Resource Piling subcontract
                    ostensibly in that capacity. Both Multistar and Geocon relied on Mr Tan’s
                    evidence in the 2004 litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The disconnect in Geocon’s original pleading</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In its original statement of claim, Geocon
                    cites Mr Tan’s words “purely reimbursement basis” taken from
                    paragraph 47 of his 2005 affidavit as evidence supporting its case that
                    Multistar engaged Geocon in April 2004 to complete Resource Piling’s
                    unfinished work on the reimbursement basis. In full, paragraph 47 of Mr
                    Tan’s 2005 affidavit reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the end, it was decided that [Multistar] would engage Geocon to carry
                        out the [works at the ECP South Location] at a lower and more competitive
                        rate than that quoted by [a third party]. This was possible because
                        [Multistar] was able to leverage on its status as Geocon’s parent
                        company to <em>engage Geocon on a purely reimbursement
                            basis</em>. Accordingly, [Multistar] was only liable to reimburse
                        Geocon for all costs and expenses directly incurred by Geocon in the course
                        of carrying out the [works at the ECP South Location].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There is a disconnect between paragraphs 11
                    and 12 of Geocon’s original statement of claim and paragraph
                    14(ii)’s citation of paragraph 47 of Mr Tan’s 2005 affidavit.
                    Paragraphs 11 and 12 plead that Resource Piling stopped work altogether in April
                    2004, following which Multistar engaged Geocon to complete Resource
                    Piling’s unfinished work. That is factually accurate: Resource Piling did
                    stop work altogether in April 2004, following which Multistar did arrange for
                    Geocon to complete Resource Piling’s unfinished work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The disconnect arises because paragraph 47 of
                    Mr Tan’s 2005 affidavit has nothing to do with Multistar engaging Geocon
                    in or around <em>April 2004</em> to complete <em>all</em> of Resource Piling’s unfinished work. Instead,
                    it describes Multistar engaging Geocon to complete Resource Piling’s works
                    at the <em>ECP South Location</em> in <em>late 2002</em>. That is not the point of time or the scope of the
                    engagement pleaded in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the statement of
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is in paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit,
                    not paragraph 47, that Mr Tan deals with the basis on which Multistar engaged
                    Geocon to complete Resource Piling’s unfinished work in April 2004. He
                    says there:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given the lack of other viable alternatives and the urgency of the
                        situation, [Multistar’s] only practical recourse was to engage Geocon
                        to take over the balance works, as Geocon was ... also carrying out the
                        [works at the ECP South Location]. Accordingly, Geocon already had manpower
                        mobilized at the Project site, and by that time also already had the
                        necessary equipment and machinery to carry out bored piling works. The
                        completion of the balance works abandoned by Resource Piling <em>was carried out at additional costs to
                        [Multistar]</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Multistar’s expert understands Geocon’s original
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Despite this disconnect, however, Multistar
                    clearly understood from the outset that Geocon’s claim on the
                    reimbursement basis is that Multistar is not entitled to rely on a lump sum
                    price but is obliged to pay Geocon on the reimbursement basis for completing
                        <em>all</em> of Resource Piling’s unfinished
                    work, whether in 2002 or in 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Multistar’s expert, Mr Ian Ness, is well
                    aware that Geocon’s original case is pleaded in paragraph 12 of its
                    statement of claim and is that Multistar engaged Geocon on the reimbursement
                    basis. He thus says in his report (with footnotes omitted):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.    ... Geocon makes a claim against [Multistar], in
                            its pleadings, for its work done based on the actual cost of the works
                            as shown in its books (i.e. the cost reimbursable method) whereas
                            [Multistar] pays Geocon a fixed amount for the work done (i.e. the lump
                            sum method) in accordance with the terms of the [Multistar/Geocon
                            subcontract].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    For clarity, ‘the cost reimbursable
                            method’ is a payment methodology in which all costs actually
                            incurred in undertaking the work are paid to that party, whilst
                            ‘the lump sum method’ is a payment methodology in which an
                            agreed, predetermined fixed sum is paid for the work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.    Thus, whilst the actual cost of the work is
                            critical to Geocon’s case, this is not relevant at all to
                            [Multistar’s] case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    Conversely, whilst maintaining the lump sum price
                            expressly shown in the [Multistar/Geocon subcontract] is critical to
                            Multistar’s case, this is not at all relevant to Geocon’s
                            case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Further, Mr Ness also clearly understands that
                    Geocon’s original case is that Multistar agreed to reimburse Geocon for
                    any extra costs incurred in completing Resource Pilings’ work, <em>whenever and wherever those extra costs were incurred</em>.
                    Thus, at paragraphs 41 to 44 of his expert report, Mr Ness says this (footnotes
                    again omitted) with reference to Geocon’s original pleading:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41.    By the pleading of Geocon, the [Multistar/Geocon
                            subcontract] it may appear was varied/changed from the fixed lump sum
                            remuneration expressly described in [that contract] to a cost
                            reimbursable contract, and hence all costs incurred to complete the
                            works (as taken into Geocon’s books) are also income directly
                            payable by [Multistar] to Geocon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42.    At first blush, this pleading by Geocon is, in the
                            industry, very surprising since it means that whilst the
                            [Multistar/Geocon subcontract] made Geocon liable to complete the
                            ‘entire’ bored pile works for the lump sum of $26 million
                            (and any extra costs incurred by Geocon to do this because of Resource
                            Piling’s departure would be to Geocon’s account),
                            Geocon’s position is that now with GC 1077 [Multistar] had agreed
                            in May 2004 to invert this arrangement and transfer the entire risk of
                            any extra costs caused by Resource Piling’s departure onto itself,
                            with no consideration at all, <em>and to backdate that
                                arrangement to the start of work in January
                        2002</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43.    With no consideration, from my years and
                            experience in this industry, I cannot see any reason why [Multistar]
                            would have had [sic] willingly accepted such an arrangement. I am
                            instructed that [Multistar] did not agree to such an
                        arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.    Further, from my review of the contemporaneous
                            documents, based on industry practice, it would seem that Geocon and
                            [Multistar] did not have such an arrangement and the only arrangement
                            was a lump sum contract. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I draw particular attention to Mr Ness’s
                    understanding, expressed in the last sentence of paragraph 42 of his report,
                    that Geocon’s case was that Multistar arranged for Geocon to complete
                        <em>all</em> of Resource Pilings’ unfinished work
                    on the reimbursement basis and “backdate[d] this arrangement to the start
                    of work in January 2002”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Ness expresses his expert opinion, in this
                    passage, that Multistar would have had no reason to agree to any such
                    arrangement willingly. After this passage, he sets out a series of detailed
                    reasons why it is his expert view that Multistar did not in fact agree to this
                    arrangement. To the extent that that evidence is relevant and admissible, it is
                    therefore already before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Geocon’s amended case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Geocon now proposes to amend its case on the
                    reimbursement basis. Geocon’s amendments to paragraphs 11, 12 and 14(ii)
                    of the statement of claim read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Amendments to paragraph 11</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is an undisputed fact that Resource Piling
                    ceased work at the ECP South Location in October 2002. Pleading that undisputed
                    fact in paragraph 11 does not change Geocon’s case for reimbursement. It
                    is merely additional factual background. Whether under the original or the
                    amended statement of claim, Geocon’s case for reimbursement does not turn
                    on a distinction between reimbursement for completing Resource Piling’s
                    work left unfinished at the ECP South Location in late 2002 and reimbursement
                    for completing Resource Piling’s work left unfinished at all other
                    locations in April 2004. Instead, Geocon’s case – both before and
                    after the amendment – is that Multistar agreed to reimburse Geocon for the
                    cost of completing <em>all of Resource Piling’s unfinished
                        work, whenever and wherever incurred</em>. Mr Ian Ness well understood
                    that aspect of Geocon’s original case (see [63] above). These amendments
                    do not change that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     By the same token, Multistar’s defence
                    too does not turn on any distinction in Geocon’s claims for reimbursement
                    for work done to complete Resource Piling’s unfinished work at the ECP
                    South Location starting at the end of 2002 or to complete Resource
                    Piling’s unfinished work at all other locations starting in April/May
                    2004. Multistar’s defence is simply that the basis of the parties’
                    contractual relationship did not change at <em>any</em>
                    time and that Multistar <em>never</em> engaged Geocon on
                    the reimbursement basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> On
                    Multistar’s case, Geocon did all of the bored piling work at all of the
                    locations and at all times subject to the lump sum price stipulated in the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract, save only for variations. This is
                    Multistar’s defence both for the work which Geocon did through Resource
                    Piling as its subcontractor and for the work which Geocon later did itself to
                    complete Resource Piling’s unfinished work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The worst that can be said of the amendment to
                    paragraph 11 is that it is unnecessary background. It clearly gives rise to no
                    prejudice for which Multistar cannot be compensated by costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Amendments to paragraph 12</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Inserting “April 2004” by
                    amendment into paragraph 12 of Geocon’s statement of claim also does not
                    change Geocon’s claim for reimbursement. Read unamended and in its
                    original context, paragraph 12 clearly refers to an engagement at a point in
                    time <em>following</em> Resource Piling’s exit in
                        <em>April 2004</em>, the only date which is pleaded in
                    the original paragraph 11. The references to the events of 2002 inserted by
                    amendment into paragraph 11 make it necessary to restate the April 2004 date in
                    paragraph 12 to ensure that it retains its original meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The worst that can be said of the amendment to
                    paragraph 12, therefore, is that it is a necessary restatement Geocon’s
                        <em>unaltered</em> case arising from the unnecessary
                    background pleaded in paragraph 11. It gives rise to no prejudice for which
                    Multistar cannot be compensated by costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Amendment to paragraph 14</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Citing paragraph 54 of Mr Tan’s 2005
                    affidavit (see [59] above) by amendment in paragraph 14(ii) also does not change
                    Geocon’s case. This amendment serves only to address the disconnect I
                    identified at [57] above. That disconnect is the discrepancy between the date of
                    April 2004 on which Geocon says Multistar engaged Geocon on the reimbursement
                    basis as pleaded in paragraph 12 and the time to which Mr Tan refers in
                    paragraph 47 of his 2005 affidavit. This is merely a matter of evidence: all
                    that the disconnect means is that the original paragraph 14(ii) refers to
                    evidence which fails to support Geocon’s case. It is not a disconnect in
                    the internal logic of Geocon’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Addressing this evidential disconnect by
                    amending paragraph 14(ii) to cite both paragraphs 47 and 54 of Mr Tan’s
                    2005 affidavit changes nothing in Geocon’s case. First, Geocon’s
                    statement of claim pleads that Multistar engaged Geocon to complete Resource
                    Pilings’ unfinished work in only one paragraph and at only one point in
                    time: in paragraph 12 and in April 2004. That remains the case even after the
                    amendments. There is no new pleading, for example, that Multistar <em>also</em> engaged Geocon <em>separately</em> to finish Resource Pilings’ unfinished work at
                    the ECP South Location in late 2002. The amendment to paragraph 14(ii) does not
                    ascribe any contractual effect to either paragraph 47 or to paragraph 54 of Mr
                    Tan’s 2005 affidavit. It merely pleads those paragraphs as <em>evidence</em> that Multistar engaged Geocon in April 2004.
                    That is an allegation of fact already pleaded in paragraph 12 of its statement
                    of claim. That is so both before and after amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, Geocon does not contend that there is
                    any difference in meaning between the words it cites from paragraph 47 of Mr
                    Tan’s 2005 affidavit and those it cites from paragraph 54.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Its amended pleading relies on both
                    paragraphs as evidence that Multistar engaged Geocon on the reimbursement basis.
                    The only difference between those two paragraphs, on Geocon’s case, is the
                    point in time referenced in each paragraph. It has been Geocon’s case
                    throughout that Multistar agreed to reimburse Geocon for its costs incurred in
                    completing <em>all</em> of Resource Piling’s
                    unfinished work. The amendment merely cites paragraph 54 as additional evidence
                    of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     There is one further amendment in this
                    category which Geocon proposes. That amendment is to paragraph 33 of its
                    statement of claim. The amendment is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There appears to have been no commercial reasons for the
                        Plaintiffs to agree to the alleged discount $1,802,901.51 as the Plaintiffs
                        were engaged by the Defendants ‘<em>on a purely
                            reimbursement basis</em>’ and ‘<em><u>at
                            additional costs to [Multistar]</u></em> as stated in Tan’s AEIC
                        (refer to paragraph 14(ii) above). [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The insertion of the underlined phrase merely echoes in paragraph
                    33 of the statement of claim the same words which are quoted from paragraph 54
                    of Mr Tan’s 2005 affidavit and which are to be inserted into paragraph
                    14(ii). It is Geocon’s case that the words “at additional costs to
                    [Multistar]” mean precisely the same thing as “on a purely
                    reimbursement basis”. The same analysis I have applied to the proposed
                    amendment to paragraph 14(ii) applies also to the proposed amendment to
                    paragraph 33.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">These amendments raise only issues of law, not fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The only effect of these amendments is to
                    introduce additional issues for me to resolve in coming to a final determination
                    on whether Multistar engaged Geocon in April 2004 to complete Resource
                    Pilings’ unfinished work on the reimbursement basis. But all of these
                    additional issues are issues of law, both procedural and
                substantive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The amended pleadings require me to determine
                    the following additional issues of law: (i) whether what Mr Tan said in
                    paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit has been proven and is properly in evidence
                    before me; and if so, (ii) whether those words said in 2005 describe a new
                    contractual relationship between the parties entered into in 2004; (iii) what
                    that contractual relationship is; (iv) whether that contractual relationship
                    entitles Geocon to claim reimbursement from Multistar for the costs of
                    completing Resource Piling’s unfinished work; and (v) which costs fall
                    within the scope of that contractual relationship. All of these are issues of
                    law. I can determine all of these issues of law without reopening the evidential
                    phase. All that I require are additional submissions from the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Geocon does not seek to adduce fresh evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is a crucial point that Geocon does not ask
                    for an opportunity to adduce further evidence to support its amended case. It
                    merely seeks leave, after the close of the evidential phase, to incorporate
                    additional material in its pleadings. Geocon is therefore prepared for its case
                    to stand or fall on the evidence which is now before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     This is a significant factor in Geocon’s
                    favour (see <em>Digilandmall.com</em> at [86]) and one
                    which I place significant weight upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Multistar does not need to adduce fresh evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I now consider whether Multistar (as opposed
                    to Geocon) needs to adduce any additional evidence of fact or opinion in order
                    to deal with this first category of amendments. It is my view that Multistar
                    does not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">No factual evidence needed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     No additional evidence is required on the
                    factual background to be introduced by amendment to paragraphs 11 and 12. Those
                    facts are undisputed. Indeed, it is counsel for Multistar who took pains during
                    the evidential phase to elicit in his cross-examination of both the factual and
                    the expert witnesses the fact that Resource Piling stopped work in the two
                    stages described at [13] above. That issue has therefore been fully explored in
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It is only in relation to the amendments to
                    paragraph 14(ii) – and the echo in paragraph 33 – that Multistar may
                    have to adduce additional evidence. Geocon’s pleaded case, even after the
                    amendments, is not a model of clarity. In particular, it is not clear whether
                    Geocon’s case is advanced on the basis that Multistar engaged Geocon to
                    complete Resource Piling’s unfinished work pursuant to a fresh contract,
                    separate and distinct from the Multistar/Geocon subcontract, or by way of a
                    variation to the Multistar/Geocon subcontract. That is a matter which Multistar
                    has already picked up on in its written closing submissions and is at liberty to
                    expand upon in supplemental written submissions or in its oral
                closing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Whatever Geocon’s case on the mode of
                    engagement, the only witness of fact whose evidence could conceivably be
                    relevant to the terms of this engagement is Mr Tan himself. Mr Tan’s
                    evidence, however, is neither relevant nor admissible on the additional issues
                    raised. Assuming in Geocon’s favour that paragraph 54 of his 2005
                    affidavit is properly in evidence before me and is found to be evidence of the
                    terms on which Multistar engaged Geocon in April 2004 to complete Resource
                    Pilings’ unfinished work, Geocon’s case then requires me to
                    ascertain those terms. But that is a question of law. My task in construing any
                    contract is to ascertain objectively the intention of the parties. The evidence
                    of Mr Tan as to the subjective contractual intent he meant to capture in
                    paragraph 54 as at April 2004 is irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Even if evidence from Mr Tan about what he
                    meant in paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit were relevant and admissible, that
                    evidence is already before me. Geocon called Mr Tan at trial upon subpoena as
                    its own witness. Counsel for Geocon sought and obtained leave under s 156 of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) to cross-examine Mr Tan. In the course of
                    that cross-examination, Geocon’s counsel put to Mr Tan these specific
                    words in paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan, in response, denied that he meant by
                    those words that Multistar agreed in April 2004 to reimburse Geocon for
                    completing Resource Piling’s unfinished work. He expanded on his answer by
                    reference to a particular paragraph of a new affidavit which he affirmed in
                    January 2014 for the purposes of these proceedings. The result is that, even if
                    Multistar were to submit that it is necessary to cross-examine Mr Tan on
                    paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit and to put that paragraph to him, counsel for
                    Geocon has already done that. All of that material is on the record, although
                    its admissibility has not yet been ruled upon. The relevance, admissibility and
                    weight of all of that evidence are ultimately matters for the parties to make
                    submissions to me upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">No expert evidence needed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     No expert evidence is required or admissible
                    on the additional issues of law raised. In their joint list of issues, both
                    experts identify the following as the first issue before them on both
                        GC1063<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and GC1077:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> “[w]hether, upon a reading of [Mr
                    Tan’s 2005 affidavit], the original lump sum contract was varied to a cost
                    reimbursable contract”. Geocon’s case on this issue in relation to
                    both GC1063 and GC1077 is then summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Geocon asserts that according to paragraph 47 of [Mr Tan’s 2005
                        affidavit], [Multistar] engaged Geocon to complete the remaining works...
                        ‘on a purely reimbursement basis’ i.e. that Geocon would be
                        reimbursed all costs incurred on the project from the very first day of the
                        project to the last day. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Both experts accept the obvious point that these are issues of law
                    for me to decide. Their joint view is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The assertion is a legal issue and one, primarily, of evidence. This is
                        outside the Experts’ jurisdiction. However, the Experts have made
                        comments and [expressed] views as to the various evidential elements of the
                        assertion in their respective [affidavits of evidence in chief] ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The comments which the experts have made and
                    the views which they have expressed on this issue are more in the nature of
                    submissions than expert evidence. I have received them <em>de
                        bene esse</em>, for what they are worth, rather than because I have
                    concluded that they are strictly speaking admissible. To the extent that the
                    views of the experts on this issue of law can legitimately be of any assistance
                    to me at all, those views are already before me insofar as they relate to
                    paragraph 47 of Mr Tan’s 2005 affidavit. Geocon does not rely on paragraph
                    54 of Mr Tan’s 2005 affidavit for any meaning different from t that which
                    it attaches to paragraph 47.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I do not consider that I need any additional
                    expert evidence at all on the legal significance of Geocon’s reliance on
                    paragraph 54 of that affidavit in addition to its initial reliance on paragraph
                    47 of that affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I turn now to the second category of
                    amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second category: alternative claims on the lump sum basis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I have summarised at [42] above the four new
                    additional alternative claims which Geocon’s amendments put forward. I
                    deal with the first and fourth additional alternative claims before turning to
                    the second and third.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     There is no rational basis on which to object
                    to Geocon’s first or fourth additional alternative claims. The first is
                    simply an alternative quantification of Geocon’s original claim on the
                    reimbursement basis. It amounts simply to omitting Geocon’s third claim
                    for $2.3m by presenting an alternative case on quantum which comprises only its
                    first claim and second claim (see [24] above). This amendment effects no change
                    to Geocon’s original case on liability. It is entirely within
                    Geocon’s prerogative to present an alternative case on quantum in this
                    way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The fourth additional alternative claim simply
                    repeats, in the body of the statement of claim, the content of Geocon’s
                    existing prayer that damages be assessed. It does not, in itself, advance any
                    positive case against Multistar, whether on the reimbursement basis or the lump
                    sum basis, or any change in Geocon’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     None of these amendments cause any prejudice
                    to Multistar for which it cannot be compensated by costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alternative inconsistent case does not offend common sense</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is only the second and third additional
                    alternative claims to which any rational objection can be taken. The objection
                    is that they are premised not on Geocon’s existing case advanced on the
                    reimbursement basis but instead adopt as part of Geocon’s positive case
                    the defence advanced by <em>Multistar</em> that the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract is a lump sum contract subject only to variations.
                    The effect of the amendments, Multistar submits, is that Geocon is attempting
                    impermissibly to put forward a new alternative positive case which is
                    inconsistent with its existing positive case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Multistar’s submission is misconceived.
                    A plaintiff may legitimately plead inconsistent cases in the alternative so long
                    as the inconsistency does not offend common sense. An obvious example which
                    offends common sense is where the pleader asserts two inconsistent versions of
                    the facts in a situation where he knows or must know that one version is false:
                        <em>Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 457 at [37] following <em>Brailsford v
                        Tobie</em> (1888) 10 ALT 194.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It does not offend common sense for Geocon to
                    advance a claim on the lump sum basis in the alternative to its existing claim
                    on the reimbursement basis. The point of divergence between the two claims is a
                    question of law, not a question of fact. The question of law will turn on the
                    view I take of the legal significance and consequences of the largely undisputed
                    facts before me. Because this is a question of law, it does not offend common
                    sense for Geocon to say, in the same pleading, that Multistar engaged Geocon on
                    the reimbursement basis for this work, alternatively that Multistar engaged
                    Geocon on the lump sum basis for this work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alternative claims do not take Multistar by surprise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Multistar cannot object to Geocon’s
                    second and third alternative additional claims on the basis that they take
                    Multistar by surprise. The figures comprised in both these claims are, in fact,
                    aspects of Multistar’s second alternative claim advanced in its own
                    defence and counterclaim (see [31]–[32] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Thus, Geocon’s second additional
                    alternative claim for $0.05m is simply the figure taken from its own audited
                    accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 (see [31] above) which is the
                    starting point for Multistar’s second alternative claim. Geocon’s
                    decision to advance by amendment a positive case that Multistar owes Geocon
                    $0.05m is simply the mirror image of Geocon losing its case on the reimbursement
                    basis but succeeding in resisting Multistar’s claim to be entitled to
                    deduct $0.71m from this figure under its second alternative claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Similarly, Geocon’s third additional
                    alternative claim for $6.8m is simply an intermediate figure embedded in
                    Multistar’s own second alternative claim (see [32] above). Again, this
                    positive case is simply the mirror image of Geocon conceding the deduction of
                    all actual payments but successfully resisting the deduction of all discounts,
                    back charges, set-offs and cross claims from the value which Multistar itself
                    attaches to the Multistar/Geocon subcontract. Geocon joined issue on all of
                    these figures in its reply and defence to counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Witnesses have already dealt with these figures</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Each figure comprised in Multistar’s
                    second alternative claim has been fully presented, attacked and defended at
                    trial. They have each been expounded upon in the factual evidence, opined upon
                    in the expert evidence, cross-examined upon in open court and submitted upon in
                    the parties’ written closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Admittedly, all of this has taken place in the
                    context of Multistar advancing its second alternative claim and Geocon resisting
                    it by way of defence. But that cannot make a substantive difference. The result
                    of either of these two additional alternative claims advanced by Geocon
                    succeeding is equivalent to Geocon successfully defending in part against
                    Multistar’s second alternative claim. Thus, whether asserted by way of
                    claim, counterclaim or defence to counterclaim, it remains the case that each
                    party has applied all necessary rigour and vigour to test each
                figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on amendments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    For all the reasons given above, therefore,
                    I am of the view that Geocon’s amendments to its statement of claim will
                    not cause any prejudice to Multistar for which it cannot be compensated by
                    costs. Indeed counsel for Multistar was unable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> to specify in oral submissions just how his
                    client could suffer any such prejudice. This is not due to any lack of
                    opportunity to consider the amendments and to take instructions from Multistar
                    or to consult Multistar’s expert witness. Close to a month elapsed between
                    the date on which Geocon filed and served its application on Multistar and the
                    date of its hearing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Instead of pointing to a specific instance
                    of prejudice, counsel for Multistar attempted to rely on six general heads of
                    prejudice. I cannot accept his submissions on any of the six. They are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     Geocon is adding a case that
                        Multistar is liable on a lump-sum basis as an alternative to its original
                        case that it is liable on a reimbursement basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> I have dealt with and disposed of
                        this argument at [92]–[98] above. Common sense is not offended. There
                        is no prejudice caused.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     Multistar may have to reopen the evidential phase of
                        this suit because all of the evidence that is now before me has gone in on
                        Geocon’s original case as pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Specifically, Multistar’s expert
                        may have to be recalled and Geocon’s expert may have to be
                        cross-examined again.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I have dealt with and disposed of this at
                        [79]–[84] above. I do not consider it necessary to reopen the
                        evidential phase of this suit. However, I am prepared to hear
                        Multistar’s counsel further on this point. If he can persuade me that
                        Geocon’s amendments make it necessary to revisit a specific
                        witness’s evidence on a specific point for a specific purpose, I am
                        prepared to direct that that evidence be taken. That can be very easily
                        dealt with without significant delay or cost. If that course proves to have
                        been necessitated by the amendments, the costs order I have made will
                        require Geocon to pay Multistar’s associated costs, to the extent that
                        they are reasonable in amount and reasonably incurred. There is either no
                        prejudice to Multistar under this head or no such prejudice for which it
                        cannot be compensated by an award of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_c"></a>(c)     There must be finality to any litigation and to
                        Geocon’s changes of position in the course of this
                            litigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> I accept that there
                        must be finality to litigation. I accept also that Geocon’s
                        application, coming just before oral submissions, comes at a late stage. It
                        is also true that this application to amend follows another late application
                        by Geocon to amend its reply and defence to counterclaim in the course of
                        trial. But I bear in mind that this is Geocon’s first application to
                        amend its statement of claim. I bear also in mind that the case for Geocon
                        is being advanced by liquidators, who have less knowledge about the factual
                        background than Multistar. Finally, for the reasons I have set out above,
                        Geocon’s changes to its case are nowhere near as fundamental as
                        Multistar complains.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_d"></a>(d)     Multistar would have to amend its closing submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This is the quintessential type of
                        prejudice for which Multistar can be compensated by costs. I have ordered
                        that Geocon pay all of these costs to Multistar, to the extent that they are
                        reasonable in amount and reasonably incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_e"></a>(e)     Multistar is not certain about the period of
                        time covered by Geocon’s alleged agreement by Multistar to reimburse
                            Geocon.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> As I have shown at
                        [62] and [84] above, Multistar has understood throughout that Geocon’s
                        case has been that Multistar is obliged to reimburse Geocon for
                        Geocon’s costs of finishing all of Resource Piling’s unfinished
                        works from 2002 onwards. That case has not changed. How well Geocon has
                        captured that case in its pleadings, even after the amendments, is a
                        question of law and a matter for submission. There is no prejudice
                        here.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        amendment comes at a very late stage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span><em>Digilandmall.com</em> (at [88]) shows that lateness
                        is not a decisive factor. I consider that the lateness is far outweighed by
                        all of the other factors I have identified in my analysis
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In short, it appears to me that the present
                    case is one where the parties have already placed before me all the evidence
                    necessary to deal with the amended case. The amendments merely formalise what is
                    already in play in this suit so that the submissions and decision can
                    concentrate on the real dispute rather than being distracted by technical points
                    of pleading. This case is squarely within the principle in [86] of <em>Digilandmall.com</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It seems to me that Multistar’s
                    counsel’s true objection to Geocon’s application to amend its
                    statement of claim is that, once the amendments are allowed, he will be deprived
                    of the two fairly technical points which he has taken in his written closing
                    submissions (see [37]-[39] above). That may be so. No doubt, Geocon seeks leave
                    to make these amendments precisely in order to address those very points. But
                    that fact alone cannot, on the principles set out in <em>Digilandmall.com</em>, be a reason for refusing leave to
                    amend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Nevertheless, to ensure that the amendments
                    do not operate unfairly to Multistar, I have imposed the following terms,
                    amongst others, on the leave granted to Geocon to amend its pleadings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     I have ordered Geocon to pay
                        Multistar the costs of and incidental to its application to amend, such
                        costs fixed at $3,000 including disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     I have ordered Geocon to pay the costs
                        occasioned by these amendments, which will include at least the costs of
                        Multistar’s consequential amendments to its pleadings and the costs of
                        amending or supplementing its written submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a matter of fairness, bearing in
                        mind the principle set out in <em>Digilandmall.com</em>
                        at [86], I have given Multistar leave to consider and address me on the
                        extent to which, if at all, it wishes to reopen the evidential phase of this
                        suit. If I am persuaded to reopen the evidential phase and if, having heard
                        the evidence, I accept that taking that further evidence was necessitated by
                        these amendments, Geocon will have to pay to Multistar its associated costs.
                        But, if I do not accept that the further evidence was necessitated by these
                        amendments, Multistar is at risk of bearing those costs and perhaps even
                        Geocon’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     I have also secured confirmation from Geocon’s
                        counsel that the present application to amend has been made as a result of a
                        considered decision by Geocon to put forward a final list of amendments such
                        that there will be no further need to amend its statement of
                            claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Further arguments on the effect of limitation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Ten days after granting Geocon leave to
                    amend its statement of claim, Multistar sought an opportunity to present further
                    arguments to me on Geocon’s amendment application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> In its further arguments, Multistar
                    argues – for the first time – that Geocon ought not to be granted
                    the leave it seeks because the amendments add a new cause of action which is
                    time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Multistar puts its further arguments this
                    way:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“a.    The Plaintiffs’ [sic] claims are time
                            barred [as pleaded in] the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No.
                            4);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    Notwithstanding the time limitation as set out in
                            the Defendants’ [sic] Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 4),
                            the Plaintiffs’ [sic] are, by way of the amendments proposed,
                            introducing a brand new cause of action on purported evidence that are
                            [sic] allegedly already within the trial; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    By reason of the foregoing, the Plaintiffs are
                            changing their case theory and presenting a new cause of action on
                            purported evidence that are [sic] already before the Court beyond the
                            limitation period as provided under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap
                            163).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Multistar’s request for further
                    arguments suggests that I should not have granted Geocon leave to amend its
                    statement of claim under O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) because its application to
                    amend is in fact governed instead by O 20 r 5(2) read with
                    O 20 r 5(5). Those rules read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5(2)  Where an application to the Court for leave to
                            make the amendment mentioned in paragraph ... (5) is made after any
                            relevant period of limitation current at the date of issue of the writ
                            has expired, the Court may nevertheless grant such leave in the
                            circumstances mentioned in that paragraph if it thinks it just to do
                            so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5(5)  An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2)
                            notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or
                            substitute a new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out
                            of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action
                            in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the
                            party applying for leave to make the amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I have declined to hear Multistar’s
                    further arguments. It does not appear to me that any argument based on r 5(2)
                    and r 5(5) can succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In its request for further arguments,
                    Multistar suggests that the claims advanced in Geocon’s amendments are
                    time-barred without specifying precisely when they became time-barred. There are
                    only two alternatives. One is that they became time-barred <em>before</em> the writ in this suit was issued. The other is that they
                    became time-barred <em>after</em> the writ in this suit was
                    issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On either alternative, Multistar’s
                    limitation argument cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims time-barred before the writ was issued </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    On the first alternative, Geocon’s
                    application to amend does not even come within r 5(2). That rule applies only if
                    a “relevant period of limitation <em>current at the date
                        of issue of the writ</em> has expired” (emphasis added). The
                    premise of r 5(2) is therefore a writ issued <em>within</em> the limitation period and an application to amend the
                    statement of claim issued <em>outside</em> the limitation
                    period. On this alternative, that is not the position before me: <em>ex hypothesi</em>, the relevant limitation period had expired
                    even before the writ was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    On this alternative, therefore,
                    Geocon’s amendment application falls to be analysed under r 5(1) as though
                    there were no limitation issue at all. That is in fact how Multistar and Geocon
                    argued it. I have explained above why, on the analysis under r 5(1), these
                    amendments ought to be allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    It is clear why an application to amend in
                    these circumstances falls entirely outside r 5(2). Permitting the amendments
                    does not deprive a defendant of the benefit of a limitation defence. To put it
                    another way, the amending plaintiff derives no benefit from the relation back
                    afforded by amending under r 5(5). Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    if Multistar’s limitation defence succeeds on this alternative, it will
                    defeat Geocon’s claim entirely. That will include both the original claims
                    and the claims inserted by amendment. So too, if the limitation defence fails,
                    it fails against both Geocon’s original claims as well as the claims
                    inserted by amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims time-barred after the writ was issued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I now consider the situation if
                    Multistar’s argument is that Geocon’s claims inserted by amendment
                    were not time-barred when the writ was issued but became time-barred <em>after</em> it had been issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    On this alternative, r 5(2) and r 5(5) are
                    clearly engaged. When those rules are engaged, the court has to determine four
                    questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does the plaintiff’s proposed
                        amendment add or substitute a new cause of action?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_b"></a>(b)     Has the period of limitation
                        applicable to that new cause of action expired? (I deal at [134] below as to
                        the standard to which this question must be determined.)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_c"></a>(c)     If so, does that new cause of action
                        arise out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of
                        action in respect of which the plaintiff has already claimed relief in the
                        action?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_d"></a>(d)     If so,
                        is it just to grant the plaintiff leave to make the proposed
                        amendment?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Authority for these four questions, if
                    authority is needed, can be found in the decision of our Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Lim Yong Swan v Lim Jee Tee and another</em> [1992]
                    3 SLR(R) 940 (“<em>Lim Yong Swan</em>”) at
                    [28] and of the English Court of Appeal in <em>Ballinger v Mercer
                        Ltd and another</em> [2014] 1 WLR 3597
                        (“<em>Ballinger</em>”) at [15]. Note,
                    however, that in the former case, it was not necessary for the Court of Appeal
                    to articulate separately the first two questions which I have set out because it
                    was common ground there that the answer to both questions was yes (see <em>Lim Yong Swan</em> at [10]). In the latter case, the fourth
                    question was not separately articulated. It is, however, clearly a distinct
                    question to be addressed before the court grants leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The sequence in which the questions have
                    been put at [115] above is not the way in which they usually appear. The usual
                    sequence inverts the first and second questions. But that cannot, as a matter of
                    strict logic, be correct. It is not possible to determine whether a relevant
                    limitation period has expired before identifying the cause of action with
                    respect to which that question is asked. Thus, whether the amendments add or
                    substitute a new cause of action must be determined first. It is only after
                    ascertaining that the amendments do introduce a new cause of action, and only
                    after that new cause of action has been identified, that the question of whether
                    the limitation period applicable to that new cause of action has expired can be
                    posed and answered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    If the answer to either the first or second
                    questions is no rather than yes, r 5(2) is not engaged at all. The
                    amendment application is governed by the general principles under r 5(1). If the
                    answer to the third question is yes, the court is obliged to go on to consider
                    the fourth question. But if the answer to the third question is no, the
                    application to amend must be dismissed. The court has no residual discretion to
                    go on and consider whether it would be just to permit the amendment in these
                    circumstances: <em>Abdul Gaffer bin Fathil v Chua Kwang
                        Yong</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056 at [11] and [12];
                        <em>Chandra v Brooke North (a firm) &amp; Brooke North
                        LLP</em> (2013) 151 Con LR 113 (“<em>Chandra</em>”) at [98]. To put it another way, the only way in
                    which the court can go on to consider the justice of permitting the amendment is
                    if the answer to the third question is yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does the amendment add a new cause of action?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The first question is whether Geocon’s
                    amendments add or substitute a new cause of action. GP Selvam JC (as he then
                    was) considered the meaning of “cause of action” as it is used in
                    r 5(5) in <em>Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v
                        Intraco Ltd and others</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382. In that case, the
                    plaintiff commenced suit against a defendant to recover $2.4m as money lent to
                    the defendant or as money held by the defendant on resulting trust for the
                    plaintiff. After the relevant limitation period had expired, the plaintiff
                    sought leave to amend its statement of claim to plead that the defendant had
                    received the $2.4m in breach of s 76 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1990 Rev Ed)
                    and was therefore a constructive trustee of that sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Selvam JC held that “cause of
                    action” referred to the relief or remedy which the plaintiff seeks and
                    not to the factual basis underpinning it. He thus held that the
                    plaintiff’s proposed amendments did indeed seek to add a new cause of
                    action because they relied on a breach of statute or on a constructive trust.
                    Selvam JC went on to determine the remaining questions against the plaintiff and
                    dismissed the plaintiff’s application (see [35]–[36]). The
                    plaintiff’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed: <em>Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco
                        Ltd</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 220.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Thus, a plaintiff clearly puts forward a new
                    cause of action when its amendment seeks a relief or remedy which carries a
                    different label from that which is sought in its unamended pleading. That is so
                    even if the new relief or remedy is claimed based on the same underlying facts.
                    The inquiry into the facts is properly the subject-matter of the third
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Even if the amendment seeks a relief or
                    remedy which carries the same label as an existing relief or remedy, however, it
                    may nevertheless be a new cause of action within the meaning of r 5(5). It
                    will be a new cause of action if the plaintiff advances a case which is
                    substantially different from its existing case. In that sense, the inquiry into
                    whether a plaintiff is seeking to present a new cause of action in the context
                    of r 5(5) is somewhat wider than the inquiry which Selvam JC found it necessary
                    to undertake on the facts of <em>Multi-Pak</em>. In that
                    case, the inquiry did not need to go beyond noting the change in the label
                    attached to the relief or remedy claimed. In other cases, the label may remain
                    the same, but the inquiry on the first question may necessitate considering the
                    manner in which the plaintiff has presented his unamended case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Thus, in <em>Steamship Mutual
                        Underwriting Association Ltd v Trollope &amp; Colls (City) Ltd</em>
                    [1986] 33 BLR 77 (“<em>Steamship
                    Mutual</em>”), an owner issued within the relevant limitation
                    period a generally indorsed writ drafted in wide terms (at 96) against its
                    architects, contractors and engineers arising from defects in the construction
                    of the owner’s building. The owner focused in its statement of claim on
                    defects in the building’s air-conditioning. Three years later, after the
                    limitation period had expired, the owner attempted to amend its statement of
                    claim to include a claim for defects in the brickwork. The owner submitted that
                    the amendments did not add a new cause of action or a new case, but simply added
                    particulars of the manner in which the defendants had breached the same duty
                    arising under the same contract as formed the basis of the cause of action
                    pleaded in its existing statement of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    amendments did add a new cause of action within the meaning of
                    O 20 r 5(5) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (UK)
                    (“English RSC 1965”). The fact that the amendments claimed the
                    same remedy of damages arising from a breach of the same duty under the same
                    contract was not determinative. The court held that it was necessary to take a
                    broader view and look beyond the duty breached to the nature and extent of the
                    breaches and the damage alleged thus far on the pleadings. Thus, May LJ said (at
                    98):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In the present case, if one remembers what a cause of action is
                        (for instance, to refer back to the dictum in <em>Letang v
                            Cooper</em> [1965] 1 Q.B. 232, 242–243), if one looks to the
                        size of this particular building, to its complexities, to other matters of
                        degree, to the statement of claim before the proposed re-amendment …
                        I feel bound to agree with the learned judge where he concluded, having
                        referred to the cases on what is a cause of action, the statement of claim
                        … related only to the air conditioning. I think that its effect was
                        to narrow the causes of action so that they became confined to breaches of
                        contract concerned with air conditioning and negligence resulting in damages
                        [sic] to the air conditioning. In the light of the definitions of a cause of
                        action already referred to, I do not think one can look only to the duty on
                        a party, but one must look also to the nature and extent of the breach
                        relied upon, as well as to the nature and extent of the damage complained of
                        in deciding whether, as a matter of degree, a new cause of action is sought
                        to be relied upon. The mere fact that one is considering what are, as it is
                        said, after all only different defects to the same building, does not
                        necessarily mean in any way that they are constituents of one and the same
                        cause of action.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    At the other end of the spectrum, though,
                    there is a valid, albeit sometimes fine, distinction to be drawn between a
                    plaintiff who seeks to put forward a substantially different case and a
                    plaintiff whose case remains the same but whose amendment merely invites the
                    court to approach it from a new angle. In <em>Dornan v JW Ellis
                        &amp; Co Ltd</em> [1962] 1 QB 583, an employee was blinded by a drill
                    bit which shattered while another employee was operating the drill. The injured
                    employee brought suit against his employer within the limitation period alleging
                    that it had been negligent in failing to provide him protective eyewear. The
                    limitation period expired. At trial, the employee applied for leave to amend the
                    statement of claim to allege that the employer was vicariously liable for the
                    other employee’s negligence in operating the drill. The English Court of
                    Appeal held (at 593) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...what is now sought to be done is not to make out a new case of
                        negligence, but to persist in the old story and invite the judge at the
                        trial to approach it, to interpret it, from a different angle or aspect. It
                        is a different approach to the same main story of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    
          <em>Dornan</em> was, of
                    course, decided at a time when the court had no power at all to allow a
                    plaintiff to amend its pleadings to add a new claim after the limitation period
                    applicable to that new claim had expired (see <em>Lim Yong
                        Swan</em> at [14]). That may explain the somewhat generous approach
                    taken towards the employee in <em>Dornan</em>. But it
                    remains the case that <em>Dornan</em> taken together with
                        <em>Steamship Mutual</em> are useful reminders that the
                    approach to the first question is holistic rather than formalistic or
                    formulaic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    To apply these principles to the present
                    case, I consider Geocon’s amendments in the two categories into which I
                    have divided them (see [40]–[42] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The amendments in the first category do not
                    advance a new cause of action. For the reasons I have set out above, these
                    amendments simply insert by amendment additional factual material into the
                    statement of claim as support for Geocon’s existing cause of action on the
                    reimbursement basis. That factual material does not, in itself, give rise to any
                    new cause of action. Geocon’s cause of action, both before and after the
                    amendments, is that Multistar engaged Geocon on the reimbursement basis to
                    complete all of Resource Piling’s unfinished work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The amendments in the second category also
                    do not advance a new cause of action within the meaning of r 5(5). The
                    second and third additional alternative claims advance a case that the
                    Multistar/Geocon subcontract remained throughout a lump sum contract. This was
                    an existing aspect of Geocon’s case at the time of Geocon’s present
                    application, although it appeared only in its reply. It is true that I granted
                    Geocon leave to insert that pleading into its reply relatively late – in
                    the course of trial. But it has nevertheless been inserted there by amendment,
                    and is now an integral component of Geocon’s case in this
                suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Rule 5(5) does not require the court to look
                    only at a plaintiff’s statement of claim in order to determine whether a
                    cause of action which the plaintiff proposes to insert by amendment is a new
                    cause of action. I consider, therefore, that I can take into account the fact
                    that these amendments merely transplant an existing case put forward by Geocon
                    in its reply into the statement of claim. It is not new.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Because I have held that Geocon’s
                    amendments do not amount to adding a new cause of action, I do not have to
                    consider the remaining questions. This is an ordinary case of amendment to be
                    determined – as Multistar was initially content to argue it – by
                    reference to the usual principles applicable to amendments under
                    r 5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In case I am wrong in my conclusion on this
                    question, however, I shall nevertheless go on to consider the remaining
                    questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Has the relevant period of limitation expired?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    A court which hears a plaintiff’s
                    application to amend its pleadings may direct this question – whether the
                    relevant period of limitation has expired – to be tried as a preliminary
                    issue. The court will then determine that question finally, then and there,
                    before going on to determine the remaining three questions and before the suit
                    is tried on its merits. This course will, however, rarely be appropriate:
                        <em>Chandra</em> at [70]. I have not adopted this
                    course in the present suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In the typical case, the court ought to
                    consider this question in the course of the interlocutory application to amend:
                        <em>Chandra</em> at [67]. In doing so, the court ought
                    to limit itself to considering only whether the defendant has a reasonably
                    arguable case on limitation: <em>Welsh Development Agency v
                        Redpath Dorman Long Ltd</em> [1994] 1 WLR 1409 at 1425H. It is for the
                    defendant to show that it has a <em>prima facie</em>
                    limitation defence. The burden of persuasion then rests on the plaintiff, as the
                    party who is seeking to amend and thereby to have the benefit of the relation
                    back, to persuade the Court that the defence of limitation is not reasonably
                    arguable: <em>Ballinger</em> at [27]–[28]. This low
                    threshold causes no prejudice to the party seeking to amend: so long as it is
                    reasonably arguable that the limitation period has expired, that question ought
                    to be addressed separately and explicitly in a fresh suit rather than determined
                    summarily in the amending party’s favour on an interlocutory
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Having set out the principles which govern
                    how I should address and determine this question, I find myself unable to form
                    or express any view on it. This is because I declined to hear Multistar’s
                    further arguments on limitation and therefore do not know what arguments
                    Multistar would have presented. I shall therefore assume, for the purposes of
                    further analysis, that Geocon is unable to show that there is no reasonably
                    arguable case that the limitation period applicable to its new causes of action
                    has expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does it arise from the same or substantially the same
                facts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The third question requires me to consider
                    whether the causes of action in Geocon’s amendments, assuming them to be
                    new, arise “out of the same facts or substantially the same facts”
                    as Geocon’s existing cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I consider it appropriate to draw guidance
                    on the purpose of the test encapsulated in these words from English authorities
                    on s 35(5) of the English Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) and r 17.4(2) of the
                    English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (“English CPR
                    1998”). These in both our O 20 r 5(5) and in the now repealed
                    O 20 r 5(5) of the English RSC 1965 have a clear historical and
                    linguistic connection with these two more recent English provisions. To
                    establish that connection, it is necessary to go into the history of
                    r 5(5).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Our r 5(5) is taken verbatim from O 20 r
                    5(5) in the English RSC 1965. Limitation periods in England, as in Singapore,
                    are laid down by primary legislation. Despite this, the English O 20 r 5(5) was
                    not supported at the time of its introduction by any primary legislation. When
                    the English limitation legislation was updated in 1980, a new statutory
                    provision was enacted to put the English r 5(5) on a statutory footing.
                    That provision is now section 35 of the English Limitation Act 1980. Sections
                    35(4) and 35(5) read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Rules of court may provide for allowing a new
                            claim ... to be made ..., but only if the conditions specified in
                            subsection (5) below are satisfied, and subject to any further
                            restrictions the rules may impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The conditions referred to in subsection (4) above
                            are the following: (a) in the case of a claim involving a new cause of
                            action, if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or
                            substantially the same facts as are already in issue on any claim
                            previously made in the original action; (b) ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It has not been thought necessary in
                    Singapore to provide legislative support for our r 5(5). Our Limitation
                    Act, which is otherwise in <em>pari materia</em> with the
                    English Limitation Act, therefore contains no equivalent of s 35 of the English
                    Act: see <em>Lim Yong Swan</em> at [25].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    When the English CPR 1998 came into force,
                    the English r 5(5) was replaced by r 17.4(2) of the English CPR 1998. This
                    new rule is virtually identical to r 5(5) of the English RSC 1965 save that
                    it has been recast in the active voice and the words “claim” and
                    “remedy” have been substituted for “cause of action”
                    and “relief”. Rule 17.4(2) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court may allow an amendment whose effect will be to add or substitute
                        a new claim, but only if the new claim arises out of the same facts or
                        substantially the same facts as a claim in respect of which the party
                        applying for permission has already claimed a remedy in the
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Although there is a significant difference
                    in the wording of s 35(5)(a) which makes it wider in scope than both r 5(5) and
                    r 17.4(2) (see <em>Goode v Martin</em> [2002] 1 WLR 1828 at
                    [37]–[41]), I do not consider that this difference affects in any way the
                    purpose underlying these words.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    That purpose is to ensure that any new claim
                    allowed by amendment under r 5(5) does not have the effect of requiring the
                    defendant to investigate, after the limitation period has expired, a
                    substantially new set of underlying facts. In <em>BP plc v AON
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 1 Lloyds Rep 549 (“<em>BP
                        plc</em>”) at [52]–[54], Colman J considered the purpose
                    of s 35(5) and said this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    At first instance in
                                <em>Goode v Martin</em> [2001] 3 All ER 562, I
                            considered the purpose of section 35(5) [of the English Limitation Act
                            1980] in the following passage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘Whether one factual basis is “substantially the
                            same” as another factual basis obviously involves a value
                            judgment, but the relevant criteria must clearly have regard to the main
                            purpose for which the qualification to the power to give permission to
                            amend is introduced. That purpose is to avoid placing a defendant in the
                            position where if the amendment is allowed he will be obliged after
                            expiration of the limitation period to investigate facts and obtain
                            evidence of matters which are completely outside the ambit of and
                            unrelated to those facts which he could reasonably be assumed to have
                            investigated for the purpose of defending the unamended claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    In <em>Lloyds Bank v Rogers</em> [1997] TLR 154, Hobhouse LJ
                            said of section 35:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘The policy of the section [is] that, if factual issues were in
                            any event going to be litigated between the parties, the parties should
                            be able to rely on any cause of action which substantially arises from
                            those facts.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    The substance of the purpose of the exception in
                            subsection (5) is thus based on the assumption that the party against
                            whom the proposed amendment is directed will not be prejudiced because
                            that party will, for the purposes of the pre-existing matters [in]
                            issue, already have had to investigate the same or substantially the
                            same facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The English Court of Appeal cited this
                    passage with approval in <em>Ballinger</em> at [34] and
                    went on to say (at [35]–[37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    In the <em>Welsh Development
                                Agency</em> case [1994] 1 WLR 1409 Glidewell LJ said, in an
                            often quoted passage at p 1418, that whether or not a new cause of
                            action arises out of substantially the same facts as those already
                            pleaded is substantially a matter of impression.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    Less well known perhaps is the cautionary note
                            added by Millett LJ in the <em>Paragon Finance</em>
                            case [1999] 1 All ER 400, 418, where he said, after citing the passage
                            from Glidewell LJ to which I have just referred: “In borderline
                            cases this may be so. In others it must be a question of
                            analysis.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    I would also point out, as did Briggs LJ in the
                            course of the argument, that ‘the same or substantially the
                            same’ is not synonymous with ‘similar’. The word
                            ‘similar’ is often used in this context, but it should not
                            be regarded as anything more than a convenient shorthand. It may serve
                            to divert attention from the appropriate inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In the present case, of course, Geocon has
                    brought its application to amend after the evidential phase rather than before
                    it. But that makes no difference to the principles identified in these passages,
                    which I adopt and apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Even if Geocon’s amendments do put
                    forward new causes of action, I consider that they “arise out of the same
                    or substantially the same facts” as its existing causes of action. I
                    arrive at this conclusion both as a matter of analysis and in light of the
                    purpose of this third question. My reasons are largely the same reasons I have
                    relied on to conclude that Multistar is not prejudiced in having Geocon’s
                    amended case determined on the factual and expert evidence that is already
                    before me, subject to Multistar having an opportunity to persuade me
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I deal with Geocon’s amendments
                    insofar as they relate to advancing an alternative claim on the lump sum basis.
                    There are no new facts pleaded in connection with this cause of action. These
                    amendments simply recharacterise the legal significance of the facts already
                    before me. I am therefore satisfied that that cause of action, even if it is
                    new, arises out of <em>precisely</em> the same facts as
                    Geocon’s existing cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The amendments relating to Geocon’s
                    original claim on the reimbursement basis plead only two new facts. The first is
                    that Resource Piling stopped work in late 2002 at the ECP South Location. The
                    second is that Mr Tan gave the evidence in the 2004 litigation which is set out
                    in paragraph 54 of his 2005 affidavit. Both of these facts are undisputed. Both
                    of these facts were at all times within Multistar’s knowledge. Both of
                    these facts have, for what it is worth, been explored at trial through the
                    evidence in chief, the cross-examination and the re-examination of the factual
                    and the expert witnesses. The dispute is not over these facts as facts but over
                    the legal significance of these facts. That dispute raises issues of law. Those
                    issues are matters for submission. I am therefore satisfied that this category
                    of Geocon’s amendments arise out of substantially the same facts as its
                    existing pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    My decision is entirely consistent with the
                    purpose encapsulated in these words taken from r 5(5). None of these amendments
                    place Multistar in the position “where it is obliged, after expiration of
                    the limitation period, to investigate facts and obtain evidence of matters which
                    are completely outside the ambit of and unrelated to those facts which it could
                    reasonably be assumed to have investigated for the purpose of defending the
                    unamended claim” (see <em>BP plc</em> at [52]).
                    These amendments raise issues of law for submission rather than issues of fact
                    for investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is it just to grant leave to amend?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Finally, I consider it eminently just to
                    grant Geocon the leave which it seeks. The amendments will allow me, once and
                    for all, to determine the true state of the accounts between Multistar and
                    Geocon. The amendments permit me to deal with the underlying issues without
                    being distracted by technical points and without causing any prejudice to
                    Multistar for which it cannot be compensated by costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The application is admittedly made late. But
                    it is not made too late. The lateness of the application is not a weighty factor
                    when placed against the fact that Multistar, as I have found, will be adequately
                    compensated by an award of costs and the liberty which I have given it to
                    address me on the necessity of reopening the evidential phase of these
                    proceedings, and to do so at Geocon’s cost.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    For all of these reasons, I have granted
                    Geocon leave to amend its statement of claim in the manner proposed and have
                    determined that I do not need to hear any further arguments from Multistar on
                    the limitation issue.</p>
