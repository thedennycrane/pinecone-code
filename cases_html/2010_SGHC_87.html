<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    district judge (“the DJ”) in <em>Public Prosecutor
                        v Lim Kay Han Irene</em> [2009] SGDC 383 (the
                    “GD”). In the district court, the appellant was convicted of one
                    charge of drink driving and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two weeks and
                    a disqualification from driving for a period of four years. Unhappy with the
                    custodial sentence, the appellant appealed. While imprisonment terms are not an
                    uncommon punishment for drink driving offences, this particular appeal involved
                    exceptional circumstances which warranted the allowing of the appeal. I set
                    aside the imprisonment term and substituted in its place a fine of $5,000. I
                    shall now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant, a female of 59 years of age, was
                    a member of the medical profession. In the early hours of 27 April 2009, at
                    about 1:32 am, she was observed by an officer manning the Expressway Monitoring
                    Advisory System (“EMAS”) to be sitting on the driver seat of motor
                    vehicle EV 4046S (the “car”) which was stationary along the Pan
                    Island Expressway (“PIE”). Another EMAS officer, Mahapandi Bin
                    Embi (“Mr Embi”) was dispatched to the scene, located along
                    lane three of the PIE in the direction of Tuas near the exit of Clementi Avenue
                    6, to make enquiries. He arrived at 1:38 am and observed that the car was
                    stationary with its engine running and the headlights on. However, its hazard
                    lights were not turned on. Mr Embi approached the car and spoke to the
                    appellant. In the course of their conversation, Mr Embi noticed that the
                    appellant had alcoholic breath and informed the Traffic Police Ops Control
                    Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Shortly a traffic police officer, Cpl Noor
                    Hibayah arrived at the scene and he observed that the appellant’s breath
                    smelled of alcohol. He conducted a breath analyzer test on the appellant which
                    she failed. The appellant was subsequently placed under arrest for driving while
                    under the influence of alcohol and escorted to the Traffic Police Department for
                    a Breath Evidential Analyzer (“BEA”) Test to be conducted. This
                    was done at about 3:47 am. The BEA Test result revealed that, for every 100
                    millilitres (“ml”) of the appellant’s breath, there
                    contained 129 microgrammes (“mg”) of alcohol. Accordingly, a
                    charge of drink driving, pursuant to section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic
                    Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”), was brought against
                    the appellant. She did not contest the charge and pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In mitigation before the DJ and in submissions
                    before me, counsel for the appellant, Mr Sant Singh SC
                    (“Mr Singh”), provided further context to the incident.
                    Mr Singh explained that the appellant was a senior consultant with the KK
                    Women’s and Children’s Hospital and possessed over 25 years’
                    experience in the practice of radiology. On 26 April 2009, the day before the
                    incident, the appellant and her husband took a friend and colleague of theirs,
                    one Dr Marielle V Fortier (“Dr Fortier”), who had just
                    arrived in Singapore and was temporarily residing in the appellant’s home,
                    to lunch during the course of which the appellant consumed some wine. After
                    lunch, at around 3 pm, the appellant upon returning to her home, was notified
                    that her aunt, Ms Lee Joo Har (“Aunt”), had suffered an extensive
                    nasal haemorrhage. The appellant shared a very close relationship with her Aunt,
                    a point which will be further elaborated on later (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> below). Immediately thereafter, the appellant arranged for
                    her Aunt to be sent to the National University Hospital (“NUH”).
                    This sequence of events was confirmed by Dr Fortier in a letter dated
                    29 May 2009. A discharge summary from NUH further confirmed that the Aunt
                    was admitted into NUH on 26 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After seeing to the administrative arrangements
                    at the hospital, the appellant returned home at around 9 pm for dinner during
                    which she again drank some wine. Mr Singh emphasised that the appellant
                    was, at this time, very disturbed by her Aunt’s hospitalisation. The
                    appellant went to bed at around 10:30 pm. However, before turning in, the
                    appellant consumed a glass of whisky as a nightcap. At 1:20 am, on 27 April
                    2009, the appellant was awoken up by a telephone call from NUH. She was informed
                    that her Aunt’s condition had taken a turn for the worse and her Aunt had
                    been transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of NUH. Fearing that the worst might
                    happen to the Aunt, the appellant immediately got into her car and drove to NUH,
                    hoping to get there as quickly as possible. From her home at Ascot Rise, the
                    appellant first drove along Dunearn Road before making a u-turn into Bukit Timah
                    Road and heading north towards Clementi Road. The appellant had intended to turn
                    left into Clementi Road but missed the turn and instead found herself turning
                    into the PIE. Realising her mistake, the appellant intended to exit the PIE via
                    the Toh Guan Exit. However, her car unexpectedly stalled, causing it to be
                    stationary along the PIE. Thereafter, the events were as described in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> and <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The DJ observed (at [10] of the GD) that, while
                    generally a fine would be the norm for a first offender like the appellant, in
                    circumstances where there were aggravating factors, a custodial sentence may be
                    appropriate. She wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    As a starting point, as stated in <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, Second
                                Edition</em> at page 938-939: “Generally a fine is the
                            norm for a first offender [for drink driving] unless there are
                            aggravating circumstances. The aggravating circumstances are usually
                            high levels of impairment of driving or intoxication as well as
                            involvement in an accident resulting in personal
                            injuries.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She then continued by noting the various aggravating factors
                    present in the case, which justified the imposition of a custodial sentence. In
                    her mind, there appeared to be four main considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       First, the DJ observed that the
                    appellant’s level of alcohol was 3.68 times over the prescribed limit of
                    35 mg/ 100 ml of breath. This, in her view, was “sufficiently high to
                    create a real risk of the Accused causing injury to people or damage to property
                    on the road” (see [12] of the GD). To her, it was entirely fortuitous
                    that there were no injuries, loss of lives and/or extensive property damage as a
                    consequence of her drink driving. Furthermore, the DJ found that “[t]he
                    usual tariff for an offence of drink driving where the level of alcohol is more
                    than three times the prescribed limit is a custodial sentence” (sse [6]
                    of the GD). Evidently, she felt that precedents tended to suggest that an
                    imprisonment term should be imposed where the alcoholic level in the
                    offender’s breath exceeded three times the prescribed limit. This
                    appeared, from my reading of her written grounds, to be the single most
                    influential factor in the DJ’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Secondly, the DJ considered that the appellant
                    made a deliberate and conscious choice to drive while in an inebriated state.
                    According to her, the appellant should have been mindful enough to seek
                    alternative transportation that were available 24 hours such as limousine or
                    taxi services. The fact that the appellant was anxious about her Aunt’s
                    medical condition was, to the DJ, no justification for the appellant to drive
                    while under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Next, the DJ took cognisance of the
                    appellant’s poor medical condition. She noted that in the
                    appellant’s mitigation plea, it was argued that the appellant suffered
                    from what was described as familial involuntary tremors. This is an
                    uncontrollable condition which would affect her fine finger activities and her
                    ability to drive properly. Given this condition, the DJ was of the view that the
                    appellant should not have taken to the wheels on 27 April
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The last factor the DJ took into account was
                    public policy. She cited Yong Pung How CJ who stated in <em>Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 265 (at [28]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    [r]oads in Singapore have to be made as safe as
                            possible for law-abiding road users and pedestrians. In cases of
                            drink-driving, the courts are always mindful that a motor car in the
                            hands of an inebriated person is a potentially devastating
                            weapon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DJ felt that the policy of protecting members of the public
                    from intoxicated drivers necessitated a strict approach. In her view,
                    like-minded individuals should be deterred from committing the same
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the circumstances, the DJ felt that an
                    appropriate sentence would be 2 weeks’ imprisonment and a period of four
                    years’ disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for
                    all classes of vehicles, reckoned from the date of her release from
                    prison.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Singh contended before me that the
                    Judge’s sentence was manifestly excessive and, for that reason, the
                    custodial sentence should be set aside. In essence, there were three pillars to
                    Mr Singh’s submissions. First, Mr Singh contended that the
                    Judge, in finding that the appellant made a conscious and deliberate decision to
                    flout road safety laws, failed to appreciate the factual matrix of the case. In
                    particular, the Judge failed to fully understand the close and intimate
                    relationship shared between the appellant and her Aunt as well as the
                    appellant’s mental state of mind in the evening of 26 April 2009 and
                    the morning of 27 April 2009. Next, it was argued that the Judge failed to
                    give due weight to various mitigating factors including the fact that the
                    appellant was a first time offender, was deeply remorseful for her actions, has
                    contributed significantly to the progress of Singapore society, and suffered
                    from poor health. Insofar as the deterrent principle was concerned, it was
                    submitted that such a principle has no application in the present circumstances.
                    Finally, contrary to what the DJ had found, Mr Singh argued that previous
                    cases did not establish a pattern of imposing a term of incarceration whenever
                    the level of alcohol in an offender’s breath was more than three times
                    over the legally prescribed limit. In fact, he sought to demonstrate that the
                    contrary was true.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The respondent’s case was
                    straightforward. DPP Lee Lit Cheng (“DPP Lee”) essentially made
                    three points. First, she urged the court to attribute little weight to the
                    various mitigating factors that had been highlighted including the argument that
                    the appellant had occasioned no accident and had posed little danger to the
                    public, was remorseful, had (previous to the offence) a clean driving record,
                    was in ill health and contributed to society. Secondly, she argued, in reference
                    to the events leading to the commission of the offence, that the appellant had,
                    in fact, deliberately driven in full knowledge of the fact that she had consumed
                    alcohol earlier. It was not the case that the appellant had forgotten that she
                    was intoxicated, as portrayed by Mr Singh. Finally, DPP Lee urged the court
                    to uphold the deterrent sentence imposed by the DJ. She contended that the level
                    of alcohol in the appellant’s breath was so high that an imprisonment term
                    was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The offence of drink driving is punishable
                    under section 67 of the RTA. That provision states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Driving while under influence of drink or

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles governing appellate intervention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is a trite law that an appellate court
                    should only intervene in the sentence imposed by a lower court where (i) the
                    judge below had erred as to the proper factual basis of the case; (ii) the judge
                    below had failed to appreciate the material placed before him; (iii) the
                    sentence imposed was wrong in principle and/or law; or (iv) the sentence imposed
                    was manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate as the case may be – see
                        <em>Tan Koon Swan v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1985-1986] SLR(R) 976 (at [4], [5] and [8]) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Cheong Hock Lai</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 203 (at [26]). For the purposes of this appeal, factors (ii)
                    and (iv) were particularly germane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing precedents and high alcohol level</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the main reason why the DJ thought it
                    necessary to impose a custodial sentence on the appellant was on account of
                    precedents, I shall now turn to consider them. But I would hasten to add that
                    precedents would, at best, only provide guidelines. Much would depend on the
                    facts and circumstances of each individual case. Here I am reminded that for the
                    purposes of sentencing, the factual matrix of the case remains the paramount
                    consideration: see <em>Tan Kay Beng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 at [45]. Of course, the
                    court is not totally at liberty, nilly willy, to disregard precedents. I think
                    the following observations of the High Court in <em>Soong Hee Sin
                        v Public Prosecutor</em>, [2001] 1 SLR(R) 475 (at [12])
                    aptly describes the position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch
                        of such varied and manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely
                        identical in this regard. While past cases are no doubt helpful and
                        sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the sentencing court, that is
                        also all that they are, ie mere guidelines only. This is especially so with
                        regard to the unreported cases, in which the detailed facts and
                        circumstances are hardly, if ever, disclosed with sufficient clarity to
                        enable any intelligent comparison to be made. At the end of the day, every
                        case which comes before the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each
                        particular accused in his own circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly
                        and keenly apprised of the fact that it is just not possible to categorise
                        cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Central to the DJ’s decision was that, in her view, previous
                    cases have established a pattern of imposing a custodial sentence where the
                    level of alcohol involved was three or more times over the prescribed limit.
                    However, it should be noted that the DJ did not cite any case in support of that
                    assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The only case which DPP Lee pointed to was
                        <em>Kim Seung Shik v Public Prosecutor</em>, MA
                    277/2009/01 (“<em>Kim Seung Shik</em>”). That
                    was a case which I decided last year and for which no written judgment was
                    issued. As such, a brief summary of the facts is in order. The case involved a
                    South Korean national, aged 40, who was working in Singapore for a Korean
                    company. His three children were staying with him in Singapore and his wife had
                    returned to South Korea to seek treatment for a medical condition. After a
                    company event in which the offender had consumed alcohol, he decided to return
                    home quickly as he was worried about his children who were left without any
                    parental supervision. As the offender was driving out of the carpark of Katong
                    Mall, he turned into a wall. Shortly thereafter, having exited from the carpark
                    onto East Coast Road, he collided into the side of a motor taxi. Later, it was
                    established that the offender’s level of alcohol was 117 mg/100 ml of
                    breath, or 3.34 times over the prescribed limit. In the district court, the
                    offender was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification
                    period of 2 years for all classes of vehicles from the date of his release from
                    imprisonment. On appeal, I reduced the imprisonment term to 1 week. However, I
                    note that there were at least three important differences between <em>Kim Seung Shik</em> and the present case. First, no damage
                    was caused in the present case. In fact, the appellant in the instant case did
                    not even get into an accident. Secondly, unlike the offender in <em>Kim Seung Shik</em>, no evidence was tendered before this
                    court to demonstrate that the appellant could not control her car. This is a
                    point which I will explore further at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>. Thirdly, the offender in <em>Kim Seung Shik</em> deliberately drove with full knowledge
                    that he was under the influence of alcohol. As I will explain later (at
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>), the same factor was not present in
                    the instant case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the other hand, Mr Singh took pains to
                    point out various cases which seemed to suggest that the contrary was, in fact,
                    true – that first time offenders of drink driving, even where the level of
                    alcohol involved was significantly high, were usually punished with a fine and a
                    period of disqualification from driving. He referred, first, to the case of
                        <em>Wong Kwee Cheong v Public Prosecutor</em>, MA
                    208/2001/01 (“<em>Wong Kwee Cheong</em>”).
                    This case is unreported but may be found summarised in <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em>, (LexisNexis:
                    2003, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed) (“<em>Sentencing
                        Practice</em>”) (at [945]) as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Facts</b>: Offender pleaded guilty to two
                        charges: (1) drunk driving: s 67(1)(b); (2) inconsiderate driving:
                        s 65. The offender drove without due care and attention by failing to
                        keep a proper lookout, and collided with a parked taxi in a carpark. Both
                        vehicles were slightly damaged and no one was injured. The offender failed
                        the breathalyser test and was arrested. At the Traffic Police HQ, the Breath
                        Evidential Analyser test was conducted and his breath specimen was found to
                        contain 98 mcg of alcohol per 100 ml of breath. He was a first
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Sentence imposed by a trial court</b>: Fined
                        $2,500 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all
                        classes of vehicles for three years on the s 67(1)(b) charge. Fined
                        $500 on the s 65 charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Results of appeal</b>: Offender’s appeal
                        lapsed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, while the breath alcohol level of the offender in <em>Wong Kwee Cheong</em> (being 2.8 times above the legal limit)
                    was not as high as the appellant’s in the instant case, the drink driving
                    in <em>Wong Kwee Cheong</em> resulted in a collision with a
                    parked taxi and both vehicles were slightly damaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Another case relied upon by the appellant was
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Emmett Ian Michael</em>,
                    [2004] SGDC 251 (“<em>Emmett
                    Michael</em>”). In this relatively straightforward case, the
                    offender was involved in traffic accident when the car he was driving collided
                    with another vehicle along Clemenceau Avenue. It was found that at the relevant
                    time, the alcohol level in the offender’s breath was 96 mg/100 ml. This,
                    as the district judge in the case noted, was more than two and a half times the
                    prescribed limit and was “[t]he most serious aggravating factor in this
                    case”: see [12] of <em>Emmett Michael</em>. In the
                    circumstance, the district judge there chose to impose a $4,300 fine and a
                    3-year disqualification. On appeal, the period of disqualification was reduced
                    to 2 years. No imprisonment term was imposed. Again, it is significant to note
                    that property damage was caused by the offender’s drink
                driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Finally, Mr Singh also made reference to
                    the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Tay Wee Wah</em>, DAC
                    63960/2009 (“<em>Tay Wee Wah</em>”). This was
                    a case recently decided by the district court on 9 December 2009. The
                    statement of facts indicated that the offender was involved in a minor accident
                    along the ECP. The proportion of alcohol in the offender’s breath was 107
                    mg/100 ml. Other than the above, no other material information could be
                    discovered from the statement of facts. The same DJ that decided this case at
                    the court below imposed, in <em>Tay Wee Wah</em>, a
                    sentence of a $4000 fine (in default 20 days’ imprisonment) and 3
                    years’ disqualification for all classes. It would be noted that 107mg/ 100
                    ml of breath was 3.06 times over the prescribed limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In addition to the cases cited by the
                    appellant, <em>Sentencing Practice</em> provides (at [941]
                    – [942]) further examples of cases where the level of alcohol in the
                    offender was considered high but where a term of imprisonment was not imposed.

<p class="Judg-1">All of the above three cases also did not involve any collision with
                    another vehicle or damage to other property. The only case cited in <em>Sentencing Practice</em> in which the offender’s blood
                    alcohol content was significant and a custodial sentence imposed in spite of the
                    fact that there was no accident was the case of <em>Thakur
                        Kewalram Samtani v Public Prosecutor</em>, MA 368/1994/01
                        (“<em>Thakur Samtani</em>”). In that
                    case, the offender was observed by the police to be driving in a zigzag manner.
                    After testing, it was found that he had a blood alcohol content of 276 mg/ 100
                    ml. This was 3.45 times over the prescribed limit. In the circumstances, the
                    trial court imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment and a
                    disqualification order from driving for five years. However, unlike the present
                    case, the offender in <em>Thakur Samtani</em>, like the one
                    in <em>Kim Seung Shik</em>, was clearly shown to have been
                    unable to control his vehicle. Moreover, in <em>Thakur
                        Samtani</em> the offender did not have the same mitigating
                    circumstances as the present case, <em>ie</em>, being
                    awoken up in the dead of night and being told that the condition of someone who
                    was very dear, and was in hospital, had deteriorated badly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Hence, the precedents were, at best,
                    inconclusive as to whether there was a rule or trend of imposing custodial
                    sentences in cases where the blood alcohol content in an offender was high. In
                    any case, it certainly could not be said, as the DJ did (at [6] of the GD), that
                    the “usual tariff for an offence of drink driving where the level of
                    alcohol is more than three times the prescribed limit is a custodial
                    sentence.” There was no pattern that the court would impose custodial
                    sentence as long as the alcohol level of the offender was three or more times
                    over the prescribed limit. Indeed, there was no basis for any court, in working
                    out the appropriate sentence for drink driving offences, to begin with that
                    premise. The judge should consider the full range of sentences that avails her
                    at law, taking into account all aggravating and mitigating
                factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this respect, the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon</em>, [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 240 (“<em>Lee Meng
                    Soon</em>”), is instructive. In that case, the offender failed to
                    keep a proper lookout while on his way to have supper and collided with a
                    motorcycle that was travelling in front of his car. The rider of the motorcycle
                    and the pillion rider both suffered serious injuries. After being apprehended,
                    the respondent was found to have 77mg of alcohol in every 100 ml of breath. This
                    was 2.2 times over the prescribed limit. Two charges were brought against him,
                    one for drink driving and the other for failure to render assistance. Insofar as
                    the drink driving charge was concerned, the trial court imposed a $3,000 fine
                    and a disqualification period of two years. Against this sentence the
                    prosecution appealed. On appeal, the High Court imposed a two-week imprisonment
                    term and a disqualification period of three years. In so doing, the High Court
                    held (at [21]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    There have been many cases where a first offender
                            under s 67(1) had been sentenced to a fine only and germane to the
                            present appeal are the factors that would affect the decision to impose
                            a sentence of imprisonment rather than a fine. It is useful to consider
                            the matter from the extreme ends of the spectrum of punishment. At the
                            minimum end is the case of a person who, after consuming a small amount
                            of alcohol, drives a vehicle on the road. He is able to control his
                            vehicle but is stopped for a random breath alcohol test which discloses
                            a level that is at or just over the prescribed limit. He is guilty of an
                            offence under s 67(1)(b). In the absence of any other material
                            factor, it would be appropriate to sentence him to the minimum fine of
                            $1,000 or an amount not far from this sum. The disqualification period
                            imposed under s 67(2) would be the minimum period of 12 months
                            unless there are special reasons not to do so. At the maximum end of the
                            spectrum is the case of a heavily intoxicated driver who careens from
                            one side of the road to the other at high speed, causing danger or even
                            injury to other persons and damage to property. The level of alcohol in
                            his body is many times over the prescribed limit. He would be accorded a
                            punishment at the maximum end of the scale, with imprisonment for a term
                            at or close to the maximum of six months and disqualification for a long
                            period, possibly for life.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    The cases have established that the principal
                            aggravating factors in an offence under s 67(1) are the level of
                            alcohol in the breath or blood <em>and the degree of
                                control of the vehicle</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    Where a first offender of an offence under
                            s 67(1) has a high level of alcohol combined with poor control of
                            his vehicle, <em>notwithstanding that by itself any of
                                those factors would not have merited a sentence of
                                imprisonment</em>, a sentence of imprisonment could be
                            justified. In my view, it is justified on the facts of this case and I
                            find the sentence of a fine imposed on the respondent to be manifestly
                            inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Lee Meng Soon</em>, the court considered
                    that the offender’s breath alcohol level, being 2.2 times over the legally
                    prescribed limit, was high. However, the court made clear that that factor alone
                    would not merit an imprisonment sentence. It was the combination of the high
                    alcohol level and the fact that the offender had poor control of his vehicle
                    that warranted a custodial term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, it was clear that the
                    alcohol level in the appellant’s breath, being 3.68 times over the
                    prescribed limit, must be considered to be significantly high. However, like the
                    High Court in <em>Lee Meng Soon</em>, I did not think that
                    this fact in itself was sufficient to warrant a custodial sentence, particularly
                    for a first time offender. It must be borne in mind that the extent to which a
                    person would be affected by a certain level of alcohol in the body would differ
                    from person to person. Thus, how well an offender could control his vehicle
                    would be a very pertinent consideration. Of course, I do not rule out the
                    possibility of a situation whereby the alcohol level involved was so high as to
                    merit an imprisonment term on its own. For the purposes of this case, I need not
                    have to speculate whether an offender in that condition would in any case be
                    able to control his vehicle. Here, however, although the alcohol level in the
                    appellant’s body was significantly higher than the prescribed limit, to
                    warrant the imposition of a custodial sentence, there had to be other
                    aggravating factors present. I will now turn to consider these other
                    factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ability to control vehicle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It will be recalled that, in <em>Lee Meng Soon</em> (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above), it was held that the offender’s ability to
                    control his vehicle was an important consideration in determining whether a
                    custodial sentence should be imposed for an offence of drink driving. An
                    offender’s ability to control his vehicle is relevant in both situations
                    where the offence of drink driving could be committed under s 67 of the RTA
                    (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). First, under
                    s 67(1)(a), if due to intoxication, a driver is unable to control his
                    vehicle, he would be guilty of the offence of drink driving. This factor, thus,
                    goes directly towards the commission of the offence. Secondly, if the alcohol
                    level in a driver’s body exceeds the prescribed limit, he would <em>ipso facto</em> be guilty of the offence of drink driving
                    under s 67(1)(b) and it does not matter whether at the relevant time, he
                    was or was not able to control the vehicle. However, if in addition, the driver
                    was, in fact, unable to control his vehicle, that would be an aggravating factor
                    for imposing a heavier sentence. Thus, under s 67(1)(b), an
                    offender’s ability to control his vehicle is relevant for the purposes of
                    sentencing. I now turn to consider whether the appellant, in addition to
                    breaching the prescribed limit of alcohol in her breath, was also unable to
                    control her vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For sentencing purposes, it must be borne in
                    mind that just because the breath or blood alcohol level of an offender exceeds
                    the prescribed limit does not mean that he is also unable to control his
                    vehicle. This is because under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, once a driver was
                    caught with a blood or breath alcohol level beyond the prescribed limit, he
                    would <em>ipso facto</em> be guilty of the offence of drink
                    driving. This can also be discerned from the legislative history of
                    section 67 of the RTA, aptly summarised in <em>Lee Meng
                        Soon</em> (at [17] – [19]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    …Section 70
                            of the old Act provided a rebuttable presumption that a person was
                            incapable of having proper control of his vehicle if the alcohol level
                            in his blood exceeded a certain level. Section 70 of the old Act
                            provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Any person who has been arrested under section 67 or 68 shall be
                            presumed to be incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle if
                            the specimen of blood provided by him under section 69 is certified
                            by a medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration in
                            excess of 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The Minister for
                            Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, in his second reading speech on 27
                            February 1996, explained the objective of the present provisions in the
                            following manner (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                            (27 February 1996) vol 65 at cols 723-724):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Currently, under existing section 70 of the Act, a person is
                            presumed to be incapable of having proper control of his vehicle if the
                            amount of alcohol found in his blood is above the prescribed legal
                            limit. This has given rise to a situation where the defence tries to
                            rebut this presumption by trying to prove in each case that the
                            defendant did not lose control of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">To prevent unnecessary debate, clause 9 of the Bill seeks to re-enact
                            section 67(1)(b) to make the presence of alcohol exceeding the
                            legal limit in a driver's blood or breath an offence in itself without
                            linking it to the control of vehicle. The new section 67(1)(b)
                            makes it clear that an offence is committed once the driver's alcohol
                            content exceeds the prescribed limit. This provision is similar to the
                            provisions in Malaysian and UK legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Therefore it is
                            clear that the prohibition encompassed by s 67(1) covers the
                            situation where a person drives a vehicle while:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    he is incapable of having proper control over
                                his vehicle on account of alcohol, even though the amount of alcohol
                                in his body does not exceed the prescribed limit; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the amount of alcohol in his body exceeds the
                                prescribed limit even though he is capable of proper control of his
                                vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, the Legislature had decided that a person who has consumed such
                        amount of alcohol that his breath or blood alcohol level exceeds the
                        prescribed limit is likely to be incapable of driving a vehicle safely, and
                        that as a matter of policy, he should be prohibited on pain of punishment
                        under penal law from driving irrespective of whether he is capable of so
                        doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, it would not follow from the mere commission of an offence under
                    s 67(1)(b) that the driver was also incapable of controlling his vehicle
                    ((cf <em>Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane (administratrix of the
                        estate of Stafford Anthony John, Deceased) v Goo Tong Sing and
                        another)</em>, [2006] 3 SLR(R) 277 at [38]). This further
                    fact must be proved. Hence, in order that the court may take this fact into
                    account for the purposes of sentencing, it must be demonstrated by the
                    prosecution, by adducing cogent evidence, that the offender was unable to
                    control his vehicle independently of the alcohol level in the offender’s
                    blood or breath. The nature of such evidence may include, but is not limited to,
                    the manner in which the offender had gotten into an accident/s such as in
                        <em>Kim Seung Shik</em> and <em>Lim Meng
                        Soon</em> or the fact that the offender was driving in a strange and
                    dangerous manner such as in <em>Thakur
                Samtani</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the present case, there was no evidence to
                    show that the appellant was unable to control her car in the early morning of
                    27 April 2009 when she was attempting to get quickly to NUH to be with her
                    Aunt. What was notable was the fact that she had driven for some distance from
                    her home in Ascot Rise to somewhere near the PIE exit of Clementi Avenue 6
                    without being involved in an accident. In short, there was absolutely no
                    evidence that the appellant’s manner of driving was dangerous or, in any
                    other way, beyond what is ordinarily acceptable bearing in mind that EMAS
                    cameras were installed along the PIE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At this juncture, I must address a point made
                    by the DJ in her GD (at [12]), where she stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[the appellant’s] level of alcohol is clearly sufficiently
                        high to create a real risk of the Accused causing injury to people or damage
                        to property on the road. She was clearly a menace to other road users when
                        she took to the wheels of her car with such a high level of alcohol in her
                        system and was a danger not only to herself but also to other road
                        users…It was only fortuitous that there were no injuries, loss of
                        lives and/or extensive property damage as a consequence of her drink
                        driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It appeared to me that the DJ had used the level of alcohol in the
                    appellant’s breath to presume that the appellant was incapable of
                    controlling her car and that the appellant would, if given enough time on the
                    road, eventually have caused personal or property damage. As such, the DJ had
                    considered the possibility of the appellant causing an accident to be an
                    aggravating factor. She would appear to have assumed that just because the
                    alcohol level in the appellant’s body was high that the appellant was
                    likely to have caused injury to others or damaged property. With respect, I
                    think the DJ’s reasoning was flawed. As I have earlier explained (see
                        <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>, above) a driver would be guilty of an
                    offence under s 67(1)(b) by the mere fact that he has a certain level of
                    alcohol in his breath or blood. His guilt did not depend on the extent of his
                    inability to control the vehicle. In ascertaining the appropriate sentence, the
                    degree to which an offender was unable to control his vehicle must be
                    demonstrated by objective evidence: see, for example, <em>Lim
                        Meng Soon</em> (at [28] – [29]). In the present case, there was
                    absolutely no evidence that the appellant’s ability to control her car was
                    hampered in any way. The fact of the matter was that the appellant was not
                    involved in any accident. Neither had she injured any person. Hence, it was
                    wrong on the part of the DJ to speculate that the appellant would likely to have
                    caused personal injury or damage to property and, on that assumption, to inflict
                    a heavier sentence on the appellant. I would reiterate that there was nothing in
                    evidence to suggest that the appellant was unable to control her car that
                    morning and thus, other than the mere fact of a high alcohol content in her
                    breath, there was no other aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Culpability of appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now turn to consider a very important factor
                    in ascertaining the appropriate punishment for the appellant, <em>ie</em>, the degree to which the appellant was culpable for the
                    offence. Culpability must be distinguished from guilt. There was no doubt that
                    the appellant in this case was guilty of the charge brought against her and
                    demonstrating her remorse, she had pleaded guilty forthwith. She should, thus,
                    be punished for the offence. However, the sentence which should be meted out to
                    the appellant must be calibrated according to the degree to which she was
                    culpable for the offence. Unlike guilt, which simply refers to the satisfaction
                    of the legal requirements of the offence as set out in statutory materials,
                    culpability pertains to the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Thus, while
                    guilt sees things in black and white, culpability takes a more nuanced approach,
                    viewing matters in shades of grey and blue. Deliberate, purposeful and
                    calculated harm-causing must be differentiated from unintended or incidental
                    peccadilloes. In assessing the degree of culpability of an offender, the court
                    must take into account, all the circumstances, including the reason why the
                    person drove on that occasion and only when this is done would the sentence
                    meted out be fair and proportionate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At [13] of her GD, the DJ had taken the view
                    that the appellant had deliberately chosen to drive with full awareness that she
                    was inebriated. The DJ wrote as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    
              <b>The decision to drive after
                                consumption of alcoholic drinks is a matter of choice and a
                                deliberate act on the part of the driver</b>. Although it was
                            stated that the Accused was anxious to go straight to her aunt as
                            quickly as possible, this cannot be regarded as justification for a
                            person to drive while under the influence of drinks… The Accused,
                            having consumed wine during lunch as well as dinner including a glass of
                            whisky (known for its high alcohol content) as a nightcap before she
                            turned in at 10.30 pm that night could and should have opted for
                            alternative means of transport to the hospital such as calling for a
                            taxi which is available 24 hours or to engage the services of Nev and
                            Freddy Limousine Svcs or to engage the services of Nev and Freddy
                            Limousine Svcs which appeared to be available 24 hours a day as shown in
                            the invoices in Annex 2 of the her (<em>sic</em>)
                            plea in mitigation. The present case was clearly not an instance where
                            no other forms of transport [were] available to the
                        Accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DPP took very much the same approach in her argument before me and
                    this was set out at [23] of her written submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Based on the appellant’s account, she had
                            “some wine” over dinner at about 8 or 9pm, and a glass of
                            whisky as a nightcap before she went to bed at about 10:30pm. The
                            hospital called her at 1.20am and her car was spotted on the PIE at
                            about 1.32am. The breathalyser test was administered at 3.47 am and the
                            result was 129 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of
                            breath. The time that the breathalyser was administered is crucial
                            because it shows that the alcohol level in the appellant’s body
                            was a staggering three and a half times that of the legal limit of 35
                            microgrammes <em>some 5 hours</em> after the
                            appellant had last consumed alcohol! It is submitted that there can only
                            be one of two possible scenarios to explain this. First, if we accept
                            that the appellant had her last drink at about 10:30pm, she must have
                            consumed <em>a lot of alcohol</em> that evening
                            before she went to bed. If so, it would have been highly unlikely that
                            the appellant would have forgotten that she had taken many drinks that
                            evening. The second possible scenario is that the appellant had been
                            drinking till late and only stopped drinking close to the time she
                            drove. In this case, it would also be far-fetched for the appellant to
                            claim that she had so quickly forgotten that she had consumed alcohol
                            not too long ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, both the DJ and the respondent had taken too clinical a
                    reading of the situation without fully appreciating the emotional state of the
                    appellant at the relevant time when she received the call from the hospital and
                    decided to drive there straight away. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In order to understand the trauma which the
                    call from the hospital had caused in the appellant, the most critical fact which
                    must be borne in mind was the extremely close relationship which the appellant
                    shared with her Aunt. Mr Singh explained that the Aunt had looked after the
                    appellant when the latter was young whilst the latter’s parents were away.
                    Accordingly, a bond akin to a mother-daughter relationship developed between
                    them over several decades. This intimacy was further accentuated when the
                    appellant moved into her current home at 10 Ascot Rise which was next door to
                    her Aunt’s home at 8 Ascot Rise. Moreover, the appellant had always taken
                    care of her Aunt’s health and medical needs. This close relationship was
                    also evidenced by the fact that the Aunt had named the appellant as the major
                    beneficiary under the Aunt’s will and given the appellant a power of
                    attorney to handle matters on her behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Against that backdrop, it would be
                    understandable if the appellant, prior to retiring to bed the evening before,
                    was very disturbed by the fact that her Aunt had been admitted into NUH as a
                    consequence of the latter suffering from an extensive nasal haemorrhage.
                    Therefore, I could hardly disagree with the appellant’s counsel’s
                    claim that the appellant went to bed distraught and in an agitated state of
                    mind. This assertion was supported by the letter from Dr Fortier, dated 29
                    April 2009, tendered in evidence. Dr Fortier had written as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I took Dr Lim (the appellant) and her husband out to a Dim Sum lunch
                        at Xin in the Holiday Inn. During this lunch, we shared a bottle of wine.
                        During our return to 10 Ascot Rise, Dr Lim was phoned by her
                        Aunt’s maid to tell her that her Aunt was bleeding heavily from her
                        chronic sinus tumour….Dr Lim arranged for her emergency
                        admission to the National University Hospital and went there to settle
                        things. Dr Lim and her husband returned for a late dinner and we shared
                        another bottle of wine. She also had some whisky after dinner, but I did not
                        think she was intoxicated. She was extremely upset and very distraught at
                        her Aunt’s collapse. She has spoken of the Aunt as being like a mother
                        to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Such emotional fragility could only have been exacerbated by the early
                    morning call from NUH on 27 April 2009, informing the appellant that her
                    Aunt’s condition had deteriorated. In those circumstances, I could hardly
                    disagree with Mr Singh that the only thought in the appellant’s mind
                    at that moment was to get to her Aunt at NUH as quickly as possible as the
                    appellant feared for the worst. Nothing demonstrated the haste at which the
                    appellant proceeded more than the fact that the call came at 1:20 am and, by
                    1:32 am, the appellant’s car was observed to be stationary along the PIE
                    in the direction of Tuas. Given this time frame and the fact that the appellant
                    would have required time to get ready to leave the house, it was clear that
                    panic overcame her. This explained why calling for a taxi or her regular
                    limousine service was not in her mind at the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Under such circumstances, it was, to me,
                    understandable that the appellant had not fully appreciated the fact, when she
                    took to the wheels at that unearthly hour, that she had drunk alcohol at lunch
                    and dinner the night before. In her anxiety to see her Aunt, it was not
                    improbable that what she had drunk the day before was not foremost in her mind.
                    I could not agree with the DJ that the appellant had made a conscious and
                    deliberate decision to flout the road traffic laws of Singapore. She acted on
                    the spur of the moment. I also found it hard to accept the respondent’s
                    contention that the appellant could not have forgotten about her consumption of
                    alcohol since the alcohol level in her breath was very high. In my opinion, such
                    an argument did not sufficiently take into account the state of anxiety and
                    panic the appellant was in - being awoken abruptly in the middle of the night
                    and being told that her Aunt’s condition had deteriorated. It was entirely
                    human if her thoughts then were to get to her Aunt’s bedside as soon as
                    possible, lest the Aunt might slip away before she reached there. Panic had
                    simply overwhelmed her. It was an emotional crisis. It was therefore necessary
                    for the court to view her action, and in turn her state of mind, in that
                    condition, and not that of a mind which was cool and calm and unaffected by such
                    emotional trauma. While it was true that the appellant had voluntarily consumed
                    wine and some hard liquor that evening, she had no plans at all to leave the
                    house. She was in bed by 10.30 pm and what happened two and a half hours later
                    was something totally unexpected. That must have come as a shock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This factual matrix served as the context to
                    the appellant’s behaviour, a context that must be fully appreciated in
                    order to correctly ascertain the culpability of the appellant. When evaluating
                    such an offender’s culpability, the court should refrain from using
                        <em>ex post facto</em> reasoning, viewed from the
                    perspective of an objective person not under similar stress, to gauge the
                    reasonableness of the offender’s actions. Such an approach would be
                    artificial and unfair to the offender, as in determining the degree of
                    culpability of the offender, the court is essentially seeking to understand his
                    or her actions in their context. The court should step into the shoes of the
                    offender and see the material events unfold through the eyes of the offender.
                    Only by so doing would the court be able to correctly appreciate the various
                    variables that contributed to the offender’s behaviour. In the present
                    case, although the appellant’s actions could not be said to be reasonable
                    or responsible if a purely objective test was used, it could also not be denied
                    that her sense of judgment was gravely affected by the emotional crisis, and the
                    fear of what would happen to the Aunt. Putting it another way, it would be fair
                    to say that her good sense of judgment had momentarily taken leave of her. While
                    I am not for a moment suggesting that she had not committed an offence under
                    s 67(1)(b), and indeed she had, it is altogether another thing to say that
                    she had committed the offence with full knowledge that she was intoxicated. It
                    would be unjust to equate her behaviour to that of someone who had deliberately
                    driven with full knowledge that he was intoxicated. It was not even analogous to
                    a situation where an offender placed himself in a difficult position by driving
                    out for drinks, for such a person should have appreciated the possible
                    consequences of his actions. Looking at the action of the appellant at its
                    worst, the appellant’s fault lay in not taking time to compose herself and
                    consider the fact that she had consumed alcohol just hours before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     To summarise, the special circumstances of
                    this case were two-fold. First, the appellant, at no time, had ever intended to
                    drink and drive. At the time when the appellant consumed alcohol, during lunch
                    and dinner of 26 April 2009, she had no intention of taking the wheel. When
                    the appellant decided to drive to the hospital, in the early hours of
                    27 April 2009, the fact that she had consumed alcohol earlier had
                    understandably slipped her mind. Secondly, the appellant’s failure to
                    appreciate that she had consumed alcohol could, to an extent, be understood. She
                    had gone to bed on 26 April 2009, expecting the effects of the alcohol to
                    be dispelled when she woke up the next morning. Unfortunately, she was awoken
                    prematurely by the urgent call from NUH. To worsen matters, the call brought
                    grave news that her Aunt was in critical condition. In such extenuating
                    circumstances, it was not surprising that panic took over and the appellant
                    failed to appreciate that she had consumed alcohol a few hours earlier.
                    Accordingly, I was of the view that the level of the appellant’s
                    culpability was not of that level which the DJ had sought to attribute to
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Public policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Another important pillar in the DJ’s
                    decision rested on the public policy of deterring drink driving. She felt that
                    the general and specific deterrence considerations warranted a custodial
                    sentence. This was also a point that the respondent pursued in the appeal. In
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Fook Sum</em>, [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 1022, Yong Pung How CJ, sitting in the High Court,
                    explained the two facets to the principle of deterrence. He stated as follows
                    (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    There are two aspects to this: deterrence of the
                            offender and deterrence of likely offenders, corresponding to specific
                            and general deterrence respectively. Specific deterrence will be
                            appropriate where the offender is a persistent offender or where the
                            crime is premeditated, though its value in the case of a recidivist
                            offender may be questionable. General deterrence aims at educating and
                            deterring other like-minded members of the general public (<em>Meeran bin
                            Mydin v PP</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 522 at [7]-[9]) by making an
                            example of the particular offender. The foremost significance of the
                            role of deterrence, both specific and general, in crime control in
                            recent years, not least because of the established correlation between
                            the sentences imposed by the courts and crime rates, need hardly be
                            mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I shall now consider briefly whether the principles of general and
                    specific deterrence were relevant considerations in the present
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The concept of specific deterrence revolves
                    around the idea of discouraging an offender from re-offending. As was explained
                    by V K Rajah J in <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik
                    Meng</em>, [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Law
                        Aik Meng</em>”) (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Specific deterrence operates through the
                            discouraging effects felt when an offender experiences and endures the
                            punishment of a particular offence. Drawing from the maxim "once bitten
                            twice shy", it seeks to instil in a particular offender the fear of
                            re-offending through the potential threat of re-experiencing the same
                            sanction previously imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In essence, specific deterrence seeks to add further disincentive
                    to offending by increasing the costs of criminal endeavours. In this manner, the
                    law hopes to persuade the offender, when faced with a similar situation, to
                    choose the right path. However, it is important to appreciate that underlying
                    the concept of specific deterrence is the premise that the offender was capable
                    of making rational choices. The offender must have had the ability to consider
                    the pros and cons of each course of action available to him. If this was not so,
                    specific deterrence would have little or no weight since imposing a greater cost
                    on criminal activities would have little impact on his future choices, made
                    under similar circumstances. This was a point touched on in <em>Law Aik Meng</em> (at [22]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Specific deterrence is usually appropriate in
                            instances where the crime is premeditated: <em>Tan Fook Sum</em> ([18] <em>supra</em>) at
                            [18]. This is because deterrence probably works best where there is a
                            conscious choice to commit crimes. Nigel Walker and Nicola Padfield in
                            <em>Sentencing: Theory, Law and Practice</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996)
                            ("Padfield &amp; Walker, 1996") at p 99 explain the theory of
                            "undeterribility". Pathologically weak self-control, addictions, mental
                            illnesses and compulsions are some of the elements that, if possessed by
                            an offender, may constitute "undeterribility", thus rendering deterrence
                            futile. Such elements seem to involve some form of impulse or inability
                            to make proper choices on the part of the offender, which, by
                            definition, runs counter to the concept of premeditation. It should be
                            pointed out here that this reasoning applies with equal cogency to
                            general deterrence (discussed below from [24]-[28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The same point was underlined in <em>Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em>, [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 753 when the High Court made the following observations (at
                    [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    A central premise underpinning such a sentencing
                            philosophy is a belief in the ability of the person concerned to make
                            rational choices, whether in relation to current or future conduct. In
                            this respect, it is not surprising that considerations of specific
                            deterrence are especially significant in situations involving
                            premeditated crimes: see <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> [1999]
                            1 SLR(R) 1022 at [18]. As a corollary, it should be similarly
                            self-evident that in most, if not all, situations involving factors
                            outside the control of the accused, or where the accused acts on the
                            basis of some irrational and uncontrollable impulse, specific deterrence
                            would often be a less compelling, if not altogether irrelevant,
                            consideration: see <em>PP v Aguilar Guen Garlejo</em> [2006]
                            3 SLR(R) 247 at [44]; <em>PP v Lim Ah Liang</em>
                            [2007] SGHC 34 at [40].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, I was of the view that
                    the case for a specific deterrence was a less compelling, although not
                    altogether irrelevant, consideration in the sentencing of the appellant. First,
                    I was persuaded that the appellant had, by nature, little or no propensity to
                    drink and drive. Mr Singh pointed out that the appellant, in the first
                    place, did not have the habit of driving regularly. Moreover, on occasions where
                    she would be drinking, the appellant had always used limousine services so that
                    she would not have to drive. Indeed, produced in evidence were tax invoices and
                    a letter from Nev and Freddy Limousine Svcs showing that the appellant had
                    regularly and frequently engaged their services since 2004. Such evidence
                    pointed towards the fact that the appellant generally had the desire to avoid
                    drink driving. Secondly, as I pointed out earlier, the circumstances in which
                    the appellant committed her offence were unique. Unlike most other offenders of
                    drink driving, the appellant was not deliberately being reckless. One could say
                    that at the crucial moment in time, the appellant was simply not thinking
                    rationally and the fear of what would happen to her Aunt dictated her
                    actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I now turn to the question of general
                    deterrence. In this regard, the specific or individual circumstances in which
                    the particular offence was committed takes a backseat and the importance of
                    upholding law and public order comes to the fore. As explained in <em>Law Aik Meng</em> (at [24] and [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    General deterrence aims to educate and deter other
                            like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a
                            particular offender: <em>Meeran bin Mydin v PP</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 522
                            at [9] ("<em>Meeran bin Mydin</em>").</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    General deterrence is derived from the overarching
                            concept of "public interest". In <em>Angliss</em> ([16] <em>supra</em>), I had specified
                            that public interest in sentencing is tantamount to the court's view of
                            how public security can be enhanced by imposing an appropriate sentence.
                            A sentencing judge should apply his mind to whether the sentence is
                            necessary and justified by the public's interest in deterring and
                            preventing particular criminal conduct: <em>Angliss</em> ([16] <em>supra</em>) at [17].
                            This context should form the backdrop for the interpretation of my
                            decision in <em>Tan Kay Beng</em>. The types of offences and offenders for which
                            punishment will be "certain and unrelenting" would therefore depend upon
                            the corresponding interest of the public in preventing that kind of
                            conduct and in restraining particular offenders. For example, given the
                            current climate where international and domestic terrorist security
                            threats are more prevalent than before, bomb hoaxers must inexorably be
                            visited with draconian sentences. (See <em>PP v Mohammad Farhan bin Moh
                            Mustafa</em> District Arrest Case No 1808 of 2004 where the accused was
                            sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment for a bomb hoax; the
                            senior district judge correctly declared at [14] that "it [was] clear
                            that the sentencing of [such] offences ... must be treated seriously and
                            that a strong deterrent be sent to those whose idle minds might
                            otherwise turn to creating false alarms".) Such offences are easy to
                            commit and difficult to detect and could become rampant if not firmly
                            dealt with. A clear signal must be unequivocally sent by the sentencing
                            court, through an appropriate sentence, that such behaviour will be
                            perennially viewed with grave and unrelenting
                        disapprobation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The High Court in <em>Law Aik Meng</em>
                    further clarified (at [22]) that general deterrence, like specific deterrence,
                    has little part to play in the sentencing of an offender when the crime was an
                    “undeterrable” kind. This is because other like-minded
                    individuals, when placed in a similar situation, would, like the offender, be
                    unable to make a conscious decision to avoid committing the offence. The
                    principle of general deterrence, accordingly, had little relevance to the
                    present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     However, I am in no way suggesting that
                    normally drink driving is “undeterrable”. Indeed, it is
                    deterrable. It would only become “undeterrable” when the offence
                    was committed in the extremely limited circumstances like the present where the
                    appellant was in no position to overcome the extreme emotional upheaval which
                    she was experiencing at that moment. As mentioned before (see <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above), where the appellant was aware that
                    she would be involved in drinking at an outing, she would arrange for the use of
                    limousine services so as to avoid any incident of drink driving. In short, there
                    was evidence to suggest that as far as drinking and driving were concerned, she
                    was generally conscious of the need to be on the right side of the law.
                    Therefore, where an offence of drink driving is committed, the court in
                    determining the sentence, must take into consideration all the circumstances and
                    calibrate the sentence to be imposed so that the ends of justice will be
                    met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At this juncture, I wish to state that this
                    court was and is conscious that drink driving remains a serious problem in
                    Singapore society. The DJ provided two tables containing some telling statistics

<p class="Judg-1">The above tables demonstrate two points. First, the number of fatal
                    drink driving accidents and, correspondingly, the number of persons killed due
                    to drink driving had increased from 2007 to 2008. Second, although the number of
                    non-fatal drink driving accidents had decreased from 2007 to 2008, it still
                    hovered at an undesirable level.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appellant’s medical condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I turn, now, to address the last aggravating
                    factor that the Judge had relied on in imposing an imprisonment term. The Judge
                    had written (at [15]) of her GD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Further, as indicated in paragraph 39 of the
                            written plea in mitigation as well as Annex 12, the Accused suffers from
                                ‘<em>familial involuntary tremors for a long
                                time which gets worse when she is nervous or stressed. These
                                movements are not controllable and would hamper fine finger
                                activities and even driving</em>’. Clearly, in such an
                            inebriated state and with an existing medical condition which affects
                            fine finger activities including driving the Accused should not have
                            taken to the wheels that night.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It cannot be disputed that the appellant
                    should not have driven her car on the morning of 27 April 2009 when she
                    suffered from such a condition. However, as I have explained earlier, the grave
                    emotional stress under which the appellant belaboured that morning were such
                    that while her decision to drive remained unforgivable (in the sense that it did
                    not excuse her for the offence of drink driving), it was at least understandable
                    why she took to the wheels. More importantly, and in any event, the
                    appellant’s medical condition had nothing to do with her offence of drink
                    driving. It was a wholly separate impediment to her ability to drive. Hence,
                    while it may be a relevant consideration in assessing whether to allow the
                    appellant to retain her driving licence, it certainly was not an aggravating
                    factor justifying the imposition of a custodial term for the appellant’s
                    offence of drink driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On the other hand, I must also add that I was
                    also not persuaded by Mr Singh’s argument that the appellant’s
                    ill health was a relevant mitigating factor in this case. In <em>Leaw Siat Chong v Public Prosecutor</em>, [2001]
                    3 SLR(R) 646 (“<em>Leaw Siat
                    Chong</em>”), Yong Pung How CJ addressed a similar argument,
                    that the appellant’s poor medical condition should warrant a lesser
                    sentence, as follows (at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13 As for the appellant's health issues, namely high blood pressure and a
                        pain in his right eye, I wish to reiterate the point I made in <em>PP v Ong Ker
                        Seng</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 134 (at [30]) that <b>ill-health is not a mitigating factor except in the most exceptional
                            cases when judicial mercy may be exercised</b>. In the present
                        case, the appellant had not presented me with evidence that the health
                        problems were of such a serious nature that I ought to reduce his sentence
                        on that ground. I also found it pertinent that the appellant had been able
                        to continue working despite his health problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ultimately, whether a case is exceptional would depend upon the
                    severity of the offender’s illness. The sort of circumstances in which
                    judicial mercy has not been exercised were helpfully compiled by the High Court
                    in <em>Chng Yew Chin v Public Prosecutor</em>, [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 124 (“<em>Chng Yew
                    Chin</em>”). In that case, the appellant, who suffered from
                    nasopharyngeal cancer, was convicted of outraging the modesty of his domestic
                    helper. It was argued that his medical condition should be a mitigation factor
                    in his favour. In response, the court noted as follows (at [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52  However, it is crucial to appreciate that the discretion
                        to grant judicial mercy is one that is exercised with the utmost care and
                        circumspection. I pause here to emphasise this important qualification by
                        highlighting some cases on point, where the plea for judicial mercy has not
                        succeeded:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    In <em>Leaw Siat Chong v PP</em> ([50] <em>supra</em>), the
                                appellant suffered from high blood pressure and a pain in his right
                                eye. This was not found to be exceptional.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    In <em>Viswanathan Ramachandran v PP</em> [2003]
                                3 SLR(R) 435 , the High Court held that the appellant's
                                condition of chronic hypertension and diabetes was not
                                exceptional.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    In <em>PP v Thavasi Anbalagan</em>
                                [2003] SGDC 61, the court did not accord significance to
                                the accused's history of heart problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    In <em>Md Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed v PP</em>
                                [2004] SGHC 233, the appellant had complained of a "host
                                of medical problems and ailments". Yong Pung How CJ reiterated,
                                at [68], that "the cases have stated that ill-health would only be a
                                mitigating factor in exceptional cases as an act of mercy, such as
                                where the offender suffers from a terminal illness".</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    In <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> ([50] <em>supra</em>), the appellant
                                was diagnosed with secondary diseases and low vision due to an acute
                                eye disease. Even though this disease might potentially cause
                                blindness, it was not found to be exceptional enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    In <em>PP v Lee Shao Hua</em>
                                [2004] SGDC 161, the court did not attach any weight to
                                the accused's health difficulties, which included tuberculosis,
                                asthma and heart problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    In <em>PP v Shaik Raheem s/o Abdul Shaik Shaikh
                                Dawood</em> [2006] SGDC 86, the appellant was diagnosed as
                                suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes, and bilateral knee
                                osteoarthritis. The pain in his right knee was permanent and likely
                                to worsen. Though his disability was sufficient to qualify as a
                                handicap under the Automobile Association of Singapore's guidelines,
                                this did not move the court to exercise mercy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In each of these cases, the plea for mercy was disregarded simply because
                        the illness complained of was not of a sufficient severity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     From precedents, judicial mercy has been exercised in two types of cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    where the offender suffered from a terminal illness: see <em>Lim Teck Chye v Public Prosecutor</em>, [2004] 2 SLR(R) 525 and <em>Chng Yew Chin</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    where the offender was so ill that a sentence of imprisonment would carry a high risk of endangering his life: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Tang Wee Sung</em>, [2008] SGDC 262.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the present case, I did not think that the
                    appellant’s medical condition fell within either of the two categories in
                    which judicial mercy has been exercised. It was submitted that, in addition to
                    the <em>familial involuntary tremors</em> described in
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> which only causes involuntary
                    finger movements, the appellant suffered from two other ailments. The first, and
                    more serious, one is a severe anaphylactic reaction. This is a reaction to an
                    unknown food substance which may cause cardiovascular collapses. While this is a
                    fairly serious condition, I am convinced that, with the proper attention and
                    medical care, the appellant’s condition can be sufficiently addressed in
                    prison without endangering her life. The other ailment is what is known as
                    Morton’s metatarsalgia of the right foot. This merely results in pain in
                    walking and requires that special footwear be made available. Such an ailment
                    does not merit the exercise of judicial mercy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rendered Public Service</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In passing, I should allude to counsel’s
                    submission that the appellant had rendered distinguished public service as a
                    well-respected radiologist. That this was a factor which the court could take
                    into consideration for purposes of sentencing was recognised in the case of
                        <em>Glenn Knight v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 523. However, in this case, I did not think I needed to rely
                    on this as a further factor to come to my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In conclusion, let me emphasise that I was, in
                    this case, only concerned with the question as to what was a just punishment to
                    impose on the appellant, taking into account all the circumstances. The fact
                    that the appellant had committed an offence of drink driving was not in issue.
                    To summarise, generally the norm in the sentencing of a first offender of drink
                    driving is a fine. Sentencing precedents do not bear out the assertion that when
                    the offender’s blood or breath alcohol level was three times over the
                    prescribed limit, a custodial sentence was usually imposed. Aggravating factors
                    must be found to justify the imposition of an imprisonment term in the present
                    case. None, in my view, could be found here. First, no evidence was adduced to
                    demonstrate that the appellant was unable to control her vehicle. Secondly,
                    there were extenuating circumstances when the appellant took to the wheels to
                    drive to the NUH that morning- see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above. This was not the normal case
                    of an offender who, after a drinking binge, decided to drive home. The appellant
                    was deeply remorseful of her action. Accordingly, I found that there were no
                    aggravating circumstances present warranting the imposition of a custodial
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the result, I made the following orders
                    which I deemed just in the circumstances:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    the term of two weeks’ imprisonment be set
                            aside;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    the appellant be fined $5,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    the four year disqualification period from holding
                            or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles imposed by
                            the DJ be maintained, save that the period was to start
                            immediately.</p>
