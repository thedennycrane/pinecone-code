Party B, in response, applies for an anti-suit injunction in Singapore to restrain party A from prosecuting the court proceedings in X on the basis that those proceedings are brought in breach of an arbitration agreement requiring all disputes between them to be arbitrated in Singapore. Party A contends that the claims made by it in the court proceedings in X are non-arbitrable under the laws of X (which party A asserts is the <span class="font-italic">proper law governing</span> <span class="font-italic">the arbitration agreement</span>) and thus, those proceedings are not brought in breach of the arbitration agreement. On the other hand, party B contends that the claims are arbitrable under Singapore law as the <span class="font-italic">law of the </span><span class="font-italic">arbitral seat</span> and thus, the court proceedings brought by party A are in breach of the parties’ arbitration agreement, thereby warranting the grant by this court of an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 What then is the system of law that should govern, at the pre-award stage, the question of whether the claims brought by party A are, or are not, arbitrable? Is it the proper law governing the arbitration agreement (as contended by party A) or the law of the seat, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law (as contended by party B)?  This threshold question lies at the heart of the applications before me. I am informed by counsel for the parties that it is a question that has hitherto not been decided by our courts. It would also appear from the leading arbitration commentaries referred to by counsel during the hearing that whilst some civil law jurisdictions have had occasion to consider this issue, it has not been addressed by any of the courts in the Commonwealth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In HC/OS 242/2021 (“OS 242”), the plaintiff, Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings, seeks a permanent anti-suit injunction against the defendant, Mr Anupam Mittal. The primary reliefs sought by the plaintiff are an injunction to restrain the defendant, his agents or otherwise from:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with the action(s) commenced or to be commenced by the defendant by way of a company petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in Mumbai, India, which was served on the plaintiff on 3 March 2021; and/or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) commencing or procuring the commencement of any legal proceedings in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“People Interactive”), or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement dated 10 February 2006, as amended from time to time (the “SHA”) in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with the rules laid down by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) and seated in Singapore in accordance with cl 20.2 of the SHA against the plaintiff, and/or Shobitha Annie Mani and/or Navin Mittal and/or Anand Mittal and/or People Interactive and/or any person in relation to any dispute relating to the management of People Interactive, or arising from, connected with or relating to any of the matters set out in the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendant in turn seeks an order in HC/SUM 1477/2021 (“SUM 1477”) to set aside or discharge an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>interim injunction order (HC/ORC 1463/2021) (“ORC 1463”) granted by the High Court against the defendant on 15 March 2021 in HC/SUM 1183/2021 (“SUM 1183”); the defendant argues that the plaintiff should not have proceeded with SUM 1183 <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> and there was material non-disclosure by the plaintiff at the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> hearing which took place before Andrew Ang SJ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As I heard OS 242 on an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> basis with full arguments presented by both sides, it is not necessary for me to deal separately with the defendant’s application in SUM 1477. In OS 242, the issue before me is whether a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted. If I allow OS 242, whether the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>injunction should be set aside is rendered moot. Conversely, if I dismiss OS 242, the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>injunction must also fall away and would consequently be set aside, irrespective of whether the plaintiff should have proceeded <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>or whether there was any material non-disclosure. I therefore focus on OS 242.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In essence, the plaintiff argues that the defendant has breached the arbitration agreement in the SHA by raising disputes “relating to the management of [People Interactive] or relating to any of the matters set out in [the SHA]” before the NCLT despite being contractually bound to submit such disputes to arbitration seated in Singapore.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In order to determine if the claims raised by the defendant before the NCLT are indeed brought in breach of the arbitration agreement in the SHA, this court has to first decide whether the claims are arbitrable in Singapore as the arbitral seat. The answer to that question turns on the consideration of a further threshold anterior question - which system of law governs the issue of determining subject matter arbitrability at the <span class="font-italic">pre-award stage</span>? Is it the law of the seat or the proper law of the arbitration agreement? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As I mentioned above at [2], it appears that there is no local authority on the point and sparse authority elsewhere addressing this specific question; unfortunately, neither is there any international consensus on the correct approach. As observed in Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span>(Kluwer Law International, 3rd ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>”) at p 639, “[t]he nonarbitrability doctrine raises potentially complex choice-of-law questions in determining what law(s) apply to determine whether a claim or dispute is nonarbitrable. There is little agreement among national courts and commentators on the resolution of this issue”. As such, I take the opportunity to consider this question in greater detail in this judgment. I start by summarising the background facts to the extent that they are material in laying down the context in relation to the present matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiff is a private equity fund incorporated under the laws of Mauritius. It holds 30.96% of the authorised, issued and paid-up share capital of People Interactive, a private limited company registered in Mumbai which carries on the business of providing various value-added and internet-related services. Amongst other things, People Interactive owns and operates a well-known online and offline matrimonial service called “shaadi.com” (“Shaadi.com”). Shaadi.com was co-founded by the defendant and his cousins, Anand Mittal (“Anand”) and Navin Mittal (“Navin”), both of whom were among the initial shareholders of People Interactive, together with the defendant. The defendant is an Indian resident and the Managing Director of People Interactive from 30 November 2004 to 30 November 2019. According to the plaintiff, the defendant holds 43.85% of the authorised, issued and paid-up share capital of People Interactive. The defendant asserts that on a “fully diluted basis”, the plaintiff’s shareholding in People Interactive is 44.38%, Anand’s is 13.13% and his 30.26%.

Clause 3.4 of the SHA envisaged that People Interactive was to complete an initial public offering (“IPO”) within five years from closing (as defined in the SHA). If People Interactive failed to complete an IPO, the plaintiff would be able to exit its investment through its redemption and, if necessary, “drag along” rights as provided for in the SHA, which meant that the plaintiff could compel the Founders to sell all or part of their shares, together with the plaintiff’s shares, to the third party buyer.

Otherwise, grave injustice would be caused to the defendant since any eventual award rendered in Singapore would be unenforceable in India. Injustice would also be occasioned to the defendant by reason of the plaintiff’s vexatious and oppressive conduct in commencing proceedings before the Singapore High Court, as the arbitration agreement does not bind all parties to the dispute while the NCLT Proceedings will and the NCLT is the natural, proper and competent forum to hear the dispute.

As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings</span>”) (at [72]–[74]), arbitrability may be relevant to an arbitration at both its initial and terminal stages. At the initial stage, under s 6(2) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), the court may refuse a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration where the dispute concerns a non-arbitrable subject matter. The arbitration agreement would, in such circumstances, be either “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” in relation to such a dispute involving a non-arbitrable subject matter. At the terminal stage, an award rendered on a non-arbitrable dispute is liable to be set aside or refused enforcement under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”) and s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA and/or under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law and s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As can be seen from the parties’ submissions summarised above at [16]–[18], it is crucial that the court first decides what system of law applies to determine the question of subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage. If it is the law of the seat (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law) that governs that question, it is common ground between the parties that shareholder disputes and even minority oppression claims <span class="font-italic">are </span>arbitrable, as held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>(at [84]). It would then not matter whether one characterises the disputes as contractual or arising out of the SHA, or as minority oppression or mismanagement claims. However, if it is the proper law of the arbitration agreement that governs the issue of subject matter arbitrability, it will (at least on the defendant’s case) then be necessary to determine what is the proper law of the arbitration agreement in the SHA before considering if the disputes are arbitrable under that law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 With regard to determining the proper law of an arbitration agreement, both parties accept that the applicable test or framework is encapsulated in <span class="font-italic">BCY </span><span class="font-italic">v BCZ</span> [2017] 3 SLR 357 (“<span class="font-italic">BCY</span>”) (at [40]), where Steven Chong J (as he then was) summarised the three-stage test as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the parties’ express choice;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the implied choice of the parties as gleaned from their intentions at the time of contracting; or </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the system of law with which the arbitration agreement has the closest and most real connection.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions on the threshold question I identified at [7] above, in my judgment, it is the <span class="font-italic">law of the seat </span>that applies to determine the issue of subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage. In my judgment, such an approach is more logical, is principled and is to be preferred over the application of the proper law of the arbitration agreement. I arrive at this conclusion for the following main reasons:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) subject matter arbitrability, when raised at the pre-award stage before the seat court, is essentially an issue of jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the same law should be applicable to arbitrability issues at both the pre-award and post-award stages; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) applying the law of the seat at the pre-award stage is more consistent with the policy to promote international commercial arbitration; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the weight of authority leans in favour of the law of the seat being applied.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I expand on each of these reasons in the paragraphs that follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Subject matter arbitrability, when raised at the pre-award stage before the seat court, is essentially an issue of jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The concept of arbitrability finds legislative expression in s 11 of the IAA which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Public policy and arbitrability </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.—(1) <span class="font-italic">Any dispute</span> <span class="font-italic">which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration under an arbitration agreement</span> <span class="font-italic">may be determined by arbitration unless it is contrary to public policy to do so.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The fact that any written law confers jurisdiction in respect of any matter on any court of law but does not refer to the determination of that matter by arbitration shall not, of itself, indicate that a dispute about that matter is not capable of determination by arbitration.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 11 of the IAA thus recognises that subject matter arbitrability is subject to the limits imposed by public policy. While the IAA is silent on the applicable law to determine pre-award subject matter arbitrability, it can be reasonably inferred that the reference in s 11(1) IAA to “public policy” is to the public policy <span class="font-italic">of Singapore</span> (as opposed to, for example, the public policy of the law governing the arbitration agreement where that law is not also Singapore law). Section 2(2) of the IAA provides that “[e]xcept so far as the contrary intention appears, a word or expression that is used both in this Part and in the Model Law (whether or not a particular meaning is given to it by the Model Law) has, in the Model Law, the same meaning as it has in this Part”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There are references to public policy in Arts 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) and 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. In the former instance, the seat court may set aside an arbitral award if it finds that “the award is in conflict with the <span class="font-italic">public policy of</span> <span class="font-italic">this State</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]. In the latter instance, the enforcement court may refuse to recognise or enforce an arbitral award if it finds that the “recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the <span class="font-italic">public policy of this State</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]. In both instances, the relevant public policy is that of the state in which the court hearing the post-award challenge sits. Thus, be it the seat court (in the case of setting-aside) or the enforcement court (in the case of recognition or enforcement), the court applies its own law regarding public policy. Even if I leave aside Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law on the basis that it does not have the force of law in Singapore by virtue of s 3(1) of the IAA, that still leaves Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii). In any event, Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law is replicated in s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. These provisions provide some support for the argument that similarly, in s 11(1) of the IAA, the reference to “public policy” in the context of arbitrability is to the public policy of Singapore. Unless expressly provided for within its own law, there is, in my judgment, no reason or need for this court, as a seat court, to apply a foreign law and determine another state’s public policy to the question of subject matter arbitrability.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Both parties referred to and relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BNA v BNB and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 456 (“<span class="font-italic">BNA</span>”) (at [53]–[55]) in support of their respective positions. I should point out at the outset that <span class="font-italic">BNA</span> was not a case involving any issue of subject matter arbitrability, but one where the court was considering a challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal on the basis that the seat of the arbitration was not Singapore but Shanghai. The court affirmed the applicability of the framework in <span class="font-italic">BCY</span> to determine the proper law of the arbitration agreement, and then commented as follows (at [49]–[50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 Before applying the <span class="font-italic">BCY </span>framework to the facts of this case, we make some brief observations as to the significance of the proper law of the arbitration agreement so as to forestall any confusion that might arise, particularly at the stage of setting aside an arbitral award though no such concern was raised in this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 A concern that might arise <span class="font-italic">at the stage of setting-aside proceedings</span> is the prospect of the seat court having to apply some law other than its own in determining the application to set aside the arbitral award. This possibility would arise if, for example, the proper law of the arbitration agreement is determined under the <span class="font-italic">BCY </span>framework to be a law other than the law of the seat. In that instance, must the seat court apply the proper law, or should it apply its own law, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the law of the seat?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the ensuing discussion and after reproducing the provisions of s 24 of the IAA and Art 34(2) of the Model Law, the Court of Appeal expressed certain views in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, and in the context of its discussion on a <span class="font-italic">post-award</span> challenge scenario. I reproduce the relevant passages below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 It is evident from the above statutory provisions that there are <span class="font-italic">some grounds of challenge for which the seat court is mandated to apply its own law</span>, most obviously, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where the challenge is made on the grounds of arbitrability</span> and of alleged conflict with the public policy of the seat: see Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 On the other hand, there are grounds of challenge where the seat court in hearing the setting-aside application is mandated to apply some law other<span class="font-italic"> </span>than its own, most obviously, when the ‘said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it’: see Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i). <span class="font-italic">In such a scenario</span>, the proper law of the arbitration agreement, as determined in the <span class="font-italic">BCY </span>framework, will have to be applied by the seat court to decide whether the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute under the terms of the arbitration agreement. However, Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) provides that the seat court will apply its own law in the event that there is no indication as to the law to which the parties had subjected the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 For present purposes, it is <span class="font-italic">not necessary for this court to express a definite view as regards the law that is to apply to determine each of the grounds of challenge</span> under s 24 of the IAA or Art 34(2) of the Model Law <span class="font-italic">as they were not before us</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I disagree with that submission. In my judgment, it is not appropriate to characterise a dispute over subject matter arbitrability as a question on the “effect” of an arbitration agreement. The effect of an arbitration agreement may engage issues such as its scope, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether a particular dispute falls within the wording or ambit of the arbitration agreement. However, in this case, the issue is simply whether the disputes raised in the NCLT Proceedings are arbitrable, <span class="font-italic">irrespective </span>of the scope of the arbitration agreement. In my judgment, the question of subject matter arbitrability is not an issue that touches on the “effect” of an arbitration agreement. Furthermore, the submission also takes that sentence in <span class="font-italic">BNA</span> out of context – as I have highlighted above at [27]–[28], the Court of Appeal’s comments were only focusing on a <span class="font-italic">post-award</span> setting aside scenario. That particular sentence was a quote from a passage from David Joseph QC, <span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements and </span><span class="font-italic">Their Enforcement</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements</span>”) at para 6.53. The relevant passage in <span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements</span> itself did not contain any discussion on the issue of the proper law to determine the question of arbitrability. In fact, the focus of the passage was on whether the putative proper law of a separable dispute resolution agreement (be it choice of court or arbitration) ought to determine questions of whether a dispute resolution agreement is impeached by allegations of invalidity or illegality. For ease of reference, I reproduce below the relevant passage from <span class="font-italic">Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at para 6.53):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.53 Likewise, the governing law of the choice of court or arbitration agreement as determined at common law will <span class="font-italic">determine questions as to formation, validity, </span><span class="font-italic">effect and discharge of such agreements</span>. Formation (including the special considerations concerning questions of disputed incorporation) has already been referred to above. Further, the putative governing law of the separable agreement ought to determine questions of whether a dispute resolution agreement is impeached by allegations of illegality or invalidity. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Mackender</span><span class="font-italic"> v Feldia AG </span>the Court of Appeal had to consider whether or not to stay proceedings brought before it on the grounds that the parties had concluded an insurance contract which made provision for disputes to be referred to the Belgian courts. The Court of Appeal made no distinction between the law governing the insurance contract and the jurisdiction agreement, but the validity of both the governing contract and the jurisdiction agreement were questions that the parties had agreed to refer to the Belgian courts in accordance with Belgian law. Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Harbour Assurance Co (UK) Ltd v Kansa General International Insurance Co Ltd </span>the question of whether or not the arbitration agreement was impeached by allegations of illegality had to be assessed by reference to the law governing the arbitration agreement, which was English law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Finally, the illustration referred to in <span class="font-italic">BNA</span> (at [54]) was an example where the law of the seat <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> directs the seat court to apply the law of the arbitration agreement in the first instance to determine its validity. That is not the case before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the circumstances and for the reasons I have articulated above, I disagree that the <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> comments in <span class="font-italic">BNA</span> afford any assistance to the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Further, in its Explanatory Note on the 1985 Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as amended in 2006 (at para 48), it was noted by the UNCITRAL secretariat that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48. Although the grounds for setting aside as set out in article 34 (2) are almost identical to those for refusing recognition or enforcement as set out in article 36(1), a practical difference should be noted. An <span class="font-italic">application for setting aside under article 34 (2) may only be made to a court in the State where the award was rendered</span> whereas an application for enforcement might be made in a court in any State. For that reason, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the grounds relating to public policy and non-arbitrability may vary in substance with the law applied </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by the court (in the State of setting aside or in the State of enforcement)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, whether it is the seat court (dealing with a setting-aside application) or an enforcement court (dealing with a request for recognition or enforcement of an award), the Model Law envisages the application of domestic law to questions of arbitrability and public policy, at least in the context of post-award applications. Since s 11 of the IAA deals with arbitrability <span class="font-italic">generally</span> without distinguishing between subject matter arbitrability pre-award and post-award, the “public policy” referred to in s 11(1) of the IAA ought, in my view, to bear the same meaning it does in the Model Law. That in turn would mean the application of the <span class="font-italic">domestic law</span> of Singapore as the seat court to determine if the subject matter of a dispute is non-arbitrable because it is contrary to Singapore’s public policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This is, in my judgment, a principled approach because the underlying purpose of the non-arbitrability rule is to set a limit on party autonomy where such autonomy conflicts with <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">public policy of the state</span> being asked to give effect to an arbitration agreement. As stated in Julian David, Mathew Lew QC, Loukas A. Mistelis &amp; Stefan Kröll, <span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2003) (“<span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration</span>”) at paras 9-1 to 9-3: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9-1 Arbitrability is one of the issues where <span class="font-italic">the contractual and jurisdictional natures of international commercial arbitration me</span><span class="font-italic">et head on</span>. It involves the simple question of what types of issues can and cannot be submitted to arbitration. Party autonomy espouses the right of parties to submit any dispute to arbitration … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9-2 <span class="font-italic">National laws often impose restrictions or limitations on what matters can be referred to and resolved by arbitration</span>. … More important than the restrictions relating to the parties are limitations based on the subject matter in issue.

As succinctly explained by Bernard Hanotiau, in “The Law Applicable to Arbitrability” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 874 (“<span class="font-italic">The Law Applicable to Arbitrability</span>”) (at [1]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1 Although judicial power is an essential prerogative of States, the parties may, if they express the wish to do so, give jurisdiction to arbitrators to settle their disputes. However, the State retains the power to prohibit settlement of certain types of dispute outside its courts. It is then claimed that the dispute is not arbitrable. If an arbitration agreement is entered into, it will not be valid. Arbitrability is indeed a condition of validity of the arbitration agreement and, <span class="font-italic">consequently, of the arbitrators’ jurisdiction.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This point is also noted in <span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration </span>at para 9-18 where the authors state that “[t]hough arbitrability is often considered to be a requirement for the validity of the arbitration agreement it is primarily a question of jurisdiction”. The jurisdiction of a tribunal has been defined as referring to “the power of a tribunal to hear a case” (see <span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and others v Kingdom of Lesotho </span>[2019] 1 SLR 263 (at [207]). Indeed, where the dispute is a non-arbitrable one, the tribunal has <span class="font-italic">no</span> power to hear the case even if the parties wish for it to be heard and regardless of the width or scope of the arbitration agreement. It is the law of the seat which limits party autonomy by prescribing what type of disputes are arbitrable and consequently, limiting the tribunal’s jurisdiction accordingly. It is therefore principled that the law of <span class="font-italic">the seat</span> should apply to determine subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This approach finds some support in the Genoa Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Fincantieri</span><span class="font-italic"> – Cantieri Navali Italiani SpA and Oto Melara SpA v Ministry of Defence, Armament and Supply Directorate of Iraq, Republic of Iraq </span>(1996) XXI YBCA 594 (“<span class="font-italic">Fincantieri</span>”) (at [13]), cited in <span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration</span> at para 9-14. The court there was faced with the question of whether disputes as to the effects of a United Nations embargo against Iraq were arbitrable and consequently, whether the Italian court proceedings should be stayed in favour of arbitration in Paris.

At first glance, it might appear that an issue of subject matter arbitrability may be seen as directed at <span class="font-italic">the claim</span> (and hence concerns a question of admissibility). However, this belies the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the consent-based analysis that underpins the “tribunal versus claim” test. A claim that a particular dispute is non-arbitrable due to its subject matter, in substance, raises a defect as to the <span class="font-italic">parties’ consent to arbitration</span>, and as I mentioned above at [31], regardless of the width and scope of the wording of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, such a claim raises a question of the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Simply put, the parties’ consent would be invalid since parties cannot agree to submit non-arbitrable disputes to arbitration as a matter of public policy. The courts will, in such circumstances, recognise (under s 6 of the IAA) that the arbitration agreement is either “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” (see above at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Further, the <span class="font-italic">consequences</span> of a challenge (whether pre-award or post-award) made to a <span class="font-italic">seat court</span>, by a party asserting non-arbitrability, are consistent with such a challenge being in the nature of a jurisdictional objection; more so where the challenge succeeds. As noted in <span class="font-italic">BBA</span> at [77] (see [39] above), “[i]f the reason for such an outcome would be that the claim could not be brought to the particular forum seized, the issue is ordinarily one of jurisdiction and subject to further recourse”. If the challenge before the seat court succeeds, it simply means that the particular dispute cannot be arbitrated in the seat. It can, however, still be <span class="font-italic">litigated</span> in the appropriate <span class="font-italic">court</span>. In contrast, there is no discretion for the tribunal to exercise as to whether it wishes to hear a dispute which is non-arbitrable. In my judgment, when so viewed through the “tribunal versus claim” lens, the question of subject matter arbitrability cannot merely be a matter of admissibility. Rather, it strikes at the tribunal’s jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, where this court as the seat court is asked to consider an arbitral tribunal’s <span class="font-italic">subject matter</span> jurisdiction on grounds of arbitrability, whether pre-award under s 6(2) and/or s 10(3) of the IAA, or post-award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Model Law, the court should, in my judgment, apply Singapore law as the law of the seat to determine that question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The conclusion I have reached above is consistent with the UNCITRAL Secretariat’s analysis of Art 16 of the Model Law in the <span class="font-italic">Analytical Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</span><span class="font-italic">: Report of the Secretary-General</span>, UNGAOR, 18th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/264 (1985) at p 38 where it is stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. Article 16 does not state according to which law the arbitral tribunal would determine the various possible issues relating to its jurisdiction.

This includes <span class="font-italic">the question of arbitrability</span> and other issues of public policy. It stands to reason that similarly, at the pre-award stage, the <span class="font-italic">seat </span><span class="font-italic">court</span> should <span class="font-italic">also</span> apply <span class="font-italic">its</span><span class="font-italic"> own law</span> to issues of subject matter arbitrability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As observed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other matters </span>[2020] 5 SLR 266 (at [50] and [68]), public policy and arbitrability are unique to each state. They are also fundamental to the forum such that an award that falls foul of public policy or arbitrability should not be enforced <span class="font-italic">even if</span> parties waive their objection. It is thus less than desirable for the seat court to have to apply the public policy considerations of another jurisdiction (based on the proper law of the arbitration agreement). On the other hand, it is wholly appropriate for the seat court to apply its own law to determine the public policy considerations of its own state. For this reason also, I conclude that it is the law of the seat that determines the issue of subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Before I end this section, I make one observation. It should be noted that the conceptual rationale behind a <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> <span class="font-italic">enforcement</span> <span class="font-italic">court’s</span> application of the non-arbitrability doctrine may well be different. Where a foreign enforcement court is asked not to recognise or enforce an arbitral award on grounds of non-arbitrability or public policy, it applies its own law to determine that question. This is described as an “exceptional escape valve” which allows contracting states of the New York Convention to refuse enforcement of an otherwise valid and binding arbitration award on non-arbitrability grounds (<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span>at pp 1040 and 643). This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings </span>(at [73]) that the effect of Art 1(5) of the Model Law which provides that the Model Law “shall not affect any other law of this State by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration or may be submitted to arbitration only according to provisions other than those of this Law” is to preserve the force of the domestic state’s laws on arbitrability. Individual states are given the discretion under the New York Convention to refuse to enforce an award it deems non-arbitrable or contrary to its own public policy. The result, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration </span>at para 9-18, is that “each country determines for itself which disputes it considers to be arbitrable”. In this case, the rationale is simply to respect the public policy considerations of contracting states such that they are not forced to enforce foreign awards they deem contrary to their own public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus, one could conceive of a scenario where a seat court in Singapore, applying its own law, refuses to set aside an award on grounds of non-arbitrability or public policy; that essentially means that the arbitral tribunal was clothed with jurisdiction to hear the dispute concerned. Despite this determination by the seat court, a foreign enforcement court may, applying <span class="font-italic">its own law</span>, nevertheless <span class="font-italic">decline</span> to enforce that award on the very same grounds of non-arbitrability and/or public policy according to its law. There is nothing incongruous or anomalous about such an outcome as this is simply an illustration of the “exceptional escape valve” mechanism that is ingrained within, and therefore in a sense envisaged by, the very structure of the Model Law and the New York Convention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On the other hand, anomalies may well result if the law of the seat is <span class="font-italic">not </span>applied to the issue of subject matter arbitrability at the pre-award stage, as I demonstrate in the next section. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The same law should be applicable to arbitrability issues at the pre-award and post-award stages </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second main reason for my conclusion is that applying the law of the seat avoids potential anomalies that would otherwise arise from applying the proper law of the arbitration agreement to the question of pre-award subject matter arbitrability. It is uncontroversial that when the seat court considers an application to set aside an award on grounds of non-arbitrability of the dispute, it applies its own law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the law of the seat) – see <span class="font-italic">BNA</span> at [28] above. However, if the defendant’s case is to be accepted, then the seat court must apply a potentially different law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the proper law of the arbitration agreement) to arbitrability issues at the <span class="font-italic">pre-award</span> stage. If so, it is not difficult to envision  potentially anomalous outcomes, and I can think of two examples. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In both examples, the following assumptions are made – (a) that the contract contains an arbitration agreement providing for disputes to be arbitrated in Singapore (b) that the proper law of the arbitration agreement is not Singapore law but a foreign system of law and (c) that the particular dispute between the parties is <span class="font-italic">not</span> arbitrable under Singapore law as the law of the arbitral seat but <span class="font-italic">is</span> arbitrable under the foreign proper law of the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the first example, party A commences court proceedings in Singapore against party B and in response, party B makes an application under s 6 of the IAA for a stay of the court proceedings in favour of arbitration. Party A asserts, in opposition to the application, that a stay should be refused because the subject matter of the dispute is not arbitrable under Singapore law as the <span class="font-italic">lex loci </span><span class="font-italic">arbitri</span> whereas party B contends that the stay should be granted because the dispute is arbitrable under the proper law of the arbitration agreement. The Singapore court finds, applying the foreign proper law of the arbitration agreement, that the dispute is arbitrable and orders a stay of the court proceedings. Arbitration proceedings are then commenced in Singapore, prosecuted and an award is rendered against party A. After the award is rendered, party A who initially (and unsuccessfully) opposed the stay application may then file an application in the Singapore court to set aside the award and rely on Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the Model Law. Since under that provision, the seat court is <span class="font-italic">mandated</span> to apply <span class="font-italic">the law of the seat</span> at the post-award setting aside stage, it would then have to decide that the dispute is not arbitrable under Singapore law and consequently, set aside the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the second example, party A commences arbitration proceedings against party B in Singapore. Party B makes an application to challenge the jurisdiction of the tribunal on the basis that the subject matter of the dispute is not arbitrable. The tribunal, applying the foreign proper law of the arbitration agreement, decides that it has jurisdiction as the dispute is arbitrable under that system of law. Party B, being dissatisfied with the tribunal’s jurisdiction ruling, applies to the High Court under s 10(3) of the IAA for the court to consider the matter, and the court agrees with the tribunal. The arbitration continues and an award is rendered against party B. Party B then applies to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) Model Law. Now, at the post-award stage, the <span class="font-italic">same court</span> would have to apply <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span> as the law of the seat, arrive at the conclusion that the subject matter is not arbitrable under Singapore law and consequently, set aside the award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Based on the examples above, it seems illogical for the same court to come to two different conclusions on subject matter arbitrability of the dispute(s) in question merely because the argument or challenge is raised at different stages in the process (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, pre-award versus post-award). The examples I have raised above are not esoteric or far-fetched and were briefly alluded to by Mr Thio SC in his oral arguments.

</div> Conceptually, that may well be so, but it does not provide a satisfactory answer to the more fundamental question, which is whether the occurrence of such anomalous outcomes is justified. One can easily imagine the substantial time and costs that would be wasted as a result of the seat court applying the proper law of the arbitration agreement for arbitrability challenges pre-award and the law of the seat post-award, particularly if the court arrives at different conclusions at both stages and an award is eventually set aside, effectively rendering it a <span class="font-italic">brut</span><span class="font-italic">um fulmen</span>. One might also argue that it is an exercise in futility to recognise, pre-award, the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal applying the proper law of the arbitration agreement only for that tribunal’s award to end up being set aside by the seat court applying the law of the seat post-award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There is no principled reason why the <span class="font-italic">same approach</span> should not be applied to subject matter arbitrability issues at <span class="font-italic">both</span> stages. Such an approach ensures that a consistent result is always arrived at by the seat court regardless when the issue of arbitrability arises. This approach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> of applying the law of the seat) is, in my judgment, correct and to be preferred. It avoids the anomalous outcomes in the two examples I have highlighted above and engenders certainty in the law.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applying the law of the seat at the pre-award stage is consistent with the policy to promote international commercial arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The third main reason is that applying the law of the seat would be more consistent with the policy to promote international commercial arbitration. As noted in <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span>at p 649:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The forum court is also fully entitled to deny effect to a foreign nonarbitrability rule if it conflicts with a mandatory law or public policy of the forum itself – <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">including specifically with public policies of the forum that favour international arbitration.</span><span class="font-italic"> Thus, even if the laws of State B provide that </span><span class="font-italic">particular statutory claims under State B’s laws may not be resolved by arbitration, State C courts may properly decide that State C’s public policy is to give broad effect to international arbitration agreements, including with regard to particular categories of disputes, and that State B’s nonarbitrability rules will therefore not be applied in State C</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Our courts have consistently given broad effect to international arbitration agreements. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tjong</span><span class="font-italic"> Very Sumito v Antig Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (at [28]) noted that an unequivocal judicial policy of facilitating and promoting arbitration has firmly taken root in Singapore. That policy is consistent with the intention expressed by Parliament in the IAA and I am prepared to accept that it is part of Singapore’s public policy to promote or favour international arbitration. Thus, the court ought to give effect to the parties’ contractual choice as to the manner of dispute resolution unless it offends our law. In my view, this extends naturally, at one end of the spectrum, from enforcing the contractual bargain of parties to arbitrate their disputes to, at the other end of that spectrum, upholding the finality of arbitral awards save for exceptional circumstances where the grounds for setting aside or refusal of enforcement are met. As such, it is in my judgment neither necessary nor desirable for this court to give effect to foreign non-arbitrability rules, particularly when doing so would potentially <span class="font-italic">undermine</span> Singapore’s policy of supporting international commercial arbitration.

</div>
</div> I note that the full report of the decision was not available and, in any event, it does not bind this court. The Brussels Court of Appeal considered that within the framework of the New York Convention, the expression “concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration” in Art II(1) does not “affect the applicability of the law <span class="font-italic">designated by the uniform solution of conflicts of laws</span> for deciding on the arbitrability of the dispute at the level of the arbitration agreement”. With respect, it is not clear to me what the court meant by that and whether it was applying a particular Belgian conflicts of law rule pointing the court to the proper law of the arbitration agreement for arbitrability issues at the pre-award stage. I am therefore hesitant to adopt the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Company M</span> and I am not persuaded that it should be followed in Singapore. The approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Company M</span> also does not cohere with the jurisdictional nature of subject matter arbitrability, would likely create anomalous results and is not consistent with the policy in Singapore to promote international commercial arbitration. In my view, the approach adopted by the Genoa Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fincantieri</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(above at [37]) is preferable and consistent with my own analysis and decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Further, the authors of <span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration </span>at para 9-18 also ultimately conclude, after noting that arbitrability is primarily a question of jurisdiction, that “the better view is that the law applicable to the question of arbitrability in court proceedings should be governed exclusively by the provisions of the law of the national court which determines the case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This conclusion is echoed by Bernard Hanotiau in <span class="font-italic">The Law Applicable to Arbitrability</span> (at [29]) where the author opines as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Suppose one of the parties has commenced the arbitration procedure in accordance with the arbitration agreement and the other party considers that the dispute is not arbitrable and starts a procedure before a national court.

Subject to any contrary solution under an applicable international convention, <span class="font-italic">it will in principle apply its national law.</span> <span class="font-italic">This is the better view </span><span class="font-italic">even if it has been argued by some authors and decided by various courts that arbitrability should be determined by the law applicable to the validity of the arbitration agreement.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the footnotes to the passage above, the author refers to<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Comparative International Commercial Arbitration </span>at para 9-18 and to <span class="font-italic">Company M</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In terms of available case law, the conclusion reached in <span class="font-italic">Fincantieri</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is aligned with the “better view” expressed in the academic literature.

Even if it is found to be Indian law, that is of no relevance as it is <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span> as the law of the seat that I have found to be relevant to the issue of subject matter arbitrability. Additionally, while the defendant argues that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement because such disputes are non-arbitrable <span class="font-italic">under Indian law</span>,

This issue concerns the construction of the arbitration agreement and its scope.

</div> However, the defendant contends that the disputes pertain to oppression and mismanagement under Indian law and do not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Parties could not have intended for disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement to fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement since it would be unworkable and liable to be declared void under Indian law.

Further, the court must consider “the pith and substance” of the dispute as it appears from the circumstances in evidence (and not just the particular terms in which the claims have been formulated in court) (see <span class="font-italic">Oei</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Leong v Goldman Sachs International </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1217 at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my judgment, all the disputes between the parties brought before the NCLT by the defendant fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.

</div> This is contrary to the express wording of the arbitration clause which specifically identifies disputes relating to the “management” of People Interactive. It is also, in my judgment, speculative to assert that parties applied their minds to or contemplated excluding claims brought under Indian companies law legislation when they opted, in the SHA, to submit their disputes to an arbitration seated in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Thus, I find that the disputes in question do fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the SHA, and the defendant commenced the NCLT Proceedings in breach of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Third issue: Whether the court should grant the permanent anti-suit injunction sought by the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, I turn to the issue of whether a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted.

This is a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> basis on which an anti-suit injunction may be granted, distinct from when such an injunction may be granted to prevent unconscionable conduct by the injunctee. There is no need to adduce any additional evidence of unconscionable conduct in cases where the party to be injuncted has brought, or is threatening to bring, proceedings in breach of its obligations under an arbitration agreement.

ORC 1458, granting the plaintiff leave to serve OS 242 and the supporting affidavit of Ms Mani on the defendant out of jurisdiction, was made on 15 March 2021. In its leave application, the plaintiff relied on O11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">r</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), namely that OS 242 was in respect of matters in which the defendant had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Even though the defendant does not reside in Singapore, he is party to an arbitration agreement which envisages arbitration seated in Singapore. As such, the defendant has also, in my view, agreed to submit to the <span class="font-italic">supervisory jurisdiction</span> of this court as the court in the arbitral seat. Such supervisory jurisdiction is not limited to merely supervising the actual arbitral process but includes the jurisdiction to supervise the conduct of a party to a contract and compelling, if necessary, that party to comply with its contractual obligations to resolve disputes with its counterparty in Singapore in accordance with the contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the context of this case where the defendant has entered into an arbitration agreement specifying Singapore as the seat of arbitration, the words “agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court” in O 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">r</span>) of the ROC are, in my judgment, wide enough to encompass an agreement to submit to such supervisory jurisdiction of this court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Secondly, and related to the point made at [73] above, the defendant’s conduct is to be taken (a) as a submission to this court’s jurisdiction or alternatively (b) a waiver of any jurisdictional irregularity.

</div> Yet, the defendant <span class="font-italic">did not</span> apply to set aside ORC 1458. As I have explained, SUM 1477 filed by the defendant on 30 March 2021 together with his supporting affidavit, was <span class="font-italic">not</span> an application to set aside ORC 1458 but to set aside <span class="font-italic">ORC 1463</span>, which was the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> injunction order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC is phrased in mandatory terms as seen by the use of the words “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall</span> within 21 days”. In my judgment, a failure to challenge jurisdiction under O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC within the prescribed time limit would mean that the defendant is, <span class="font-italic">thereafter</span>, taken to have submitted to the court’s jurisdiction or waived any jurisdictional irregularity in relation to OS 242. Alternatively, the court is entitled to proceed on the basis that there has been “proper service” on the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew</span> at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 There is support for my conclusion in the authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Wo</span><span class="font-italic">h Hup (Pte Ltd v Property Development Ltd </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 473 (“<span class="font-italic">Wo</span><span class="font-italic">h Hup</span>”) (at [20]), Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) considered that a failure to enter a conditional appearance with a view of setting aside the service of the originating summons outside of the jurisdiction on the ground of lack of jurisdiction meant that the defendants had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. The commentary in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 202</span><span class="font-italic">1 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 12/7/4 regarding O 12 r 7 of the ROC, states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…But where a defendant disputes the court’s jurisdiction he must comply with the provisions of O.12, r.7. Thus, a defendant who wishes to challenge an order extending the validity of a writ should do so by invoking O. 12, r.7(1) … Failure to do so will <span class="font-italic">preclude the defendant from challenging jurisdiction at a later stage</span> in the proceedings …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Allenger</span><span class="font-italic"> Shiona (trustee-in-bankruptcy of the estate of Pelletier, Richard Paul Joseph) v Pelletier, Olga and another </span>[2020] SGHC 279 (at [104]), Ang SJ noted that the effect of the time limits for challenging the court’s jurisdiction in O 12 r 7(1) of the ROC is to <span class="font-italic">disallow challenges made beyond such limits</span>, unless an extension has been granted. Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd v Zoom Communications Ltd </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1324 (at [30]), Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) also opined, in the context of a stay application, that a non-challenge as to jurisdiction would ordinarily be construed as a submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my judgment, the proposition that a defendant who fails to dispute jurisdiction in accordance with the ROC is precluded from later challenging jurisdiction applies equally in the context of O 28 r 2A(1); particularly so since the wording of O 28 r 2A(1) of the ROC is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 12 r 7(1). Thus, the defendant’s assertions on affidavit are, in my judgment, ineffective and inadequate to constitute a dispute as to the court’s jurisdiction (and by extension, his amenability to this court’s jurisdiction). It does not alter the fact that the defendant’s decision not to challenge the court’s jurisdiction in the manner prescribed by O 28 r 2A(1), by way of an application to set aside or discharge ORC 1458, would amount to a submission to this court’s jurisdiction in so far as OS 242 is concerned, or at the least a waiver of any jurisdictional irregularity that may have existed. Alternatively, even if I am wrong on this, in these circumstances, the court nevertheless proceeds on the assumption that the defendant has been properly served; until ORC 1458 is set aside, it remains a valid order and the court proceeds on that basis. Thus, the amenability requirement would still be met. As held in <span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew</span> at (see [72] above), the amenability test is satisfied either by proper service or submission to jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Finally, while the defendant argues that OS 242 was not validly served out of jurisdiction since the disputes are non-arbitrable under Indian law, that contention falls away in the light of my conclusions above on the issue of arbitrability. I therefore reject the defendant’s contention that he is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Since, as I have found, the defendant’s commencement of the NCLT Proceedings in India is in breach of the arbitration agreement in the SHA, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, an anti-suit injunction should be granted against the defendant unless there is strong reason not to do so. Concerns regarding comity do not arise in this case since there is no delay by the plaintiff in seeking injunctive relief. Ultimately, this court is not arrogating to itself jurisdiction exercised by the court of a foreign friendly state but is merely seeking to uphold and enforce the parties’ contractual bargain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The remaining question is whether there nevertheless exists strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is no strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Mr Nandakumar raised four grounds in seeking to establish the existence of strong reason not to grant an anti-suit injunction, namely:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the resulting award will not be enforceable in India;

</div></div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my judgment, none of these grounds, singly or collectively, constitutes strong reason not to grant the injunction sought by the plaintiff. I address each ground in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The first ground, even if correct, does not afford strong reason why the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. The seat court is not concerned with ensuring that an award emanating from a tribunal in the seat country will be enforceable, whether in the jurisdiction where enforcement will likely take place or in any other jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> (at [26]) stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Second, it is important to remember that arbitration is not an end in itself. Parties engage in arbitration in order to obtain an arbitral award that can be enforced. An arbitral award in respect of [a] non-arbitrable claim is a <span class="font-italic">brutum</span><span class="font-italic"> fulmen </span>as it can be set aside under s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the AA even if the issue of arbitrability is not raised by the parties. It is an utter waste of time for parties to incur time and cost through arbitration, only to obtain an arbitral award that is later set aside for non-arbitrability, and to have the entire litigation process repeated again to have their dispute sorted out…. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whilst <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil</span> was a case concerned with the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed), the observations made by the court in the passage quoted above would apply equally to an arbitration subject to the IAA. The seat court’s concern, if at all, should be to ensure as far as possible that an award rendered in the arbitral seat does not become a <span class="font-italic">brutum</span><span class="font-italic"> fulmen</span> because it is liable to being set aside by the very same seat court on account of non-arbitrability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 That reasoning cannot however be extended to also ensuring that the award will be enforceable in all other conceivable jurisdictions. Public policy and arbitrability considerations are unique to individual states. Both the Model Law and the New York Convention recognise this by providing for an “escape valve” mechanism allowing contracting states to refuse to recognise or enforce an arbitral award it deems to be contrary to its own policy. As I have alluded to at [46], this “risk” is inherent within the scheme of international commercial arbitration. Further, under the New York Convention, any award rendered by a tribunal in this case is potentially enforceable in any country in which the said convention applies, and not just in India. It would be speculative for the court to predict which are the more likely venues of enforcement especially given that assets may be moved from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As such, the likelihood of an award being enforceable in other jurisdictions, while it may conceivably be raised as a factor for the court’s consideration, does not, in my judgment, amount to strong reason in this case not to grant the anti-suit injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The second ground is also insufficient to amount to strong reason. Flowing from my conclusions that subject matter arbitrability is governed by the law of the seat and that the claims made by the defendant in the NCLT Proceedings are arbitrable, it follows that the NCLT Proceedings were brought by the defendant in breach of the arbitration agreement and are therefore, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, vexatious and oppressive. The arguments on how the proceedings in Singapore were conducted or prosecuted by plaintiff also fall away and are, in any case, not enough to displace the case for an anti-suit injunction. It cannot, in the circumstances, be said that the application for an anti-suit injunction was itself vexatious and oppressive conduct by the plaintiff, especially since the plaintiff would, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, be <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> to an anti-suit injunction to enforce the arbitration agreement in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The third ground also falls away in the light of the defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement. There is no need for the plaintiff to show any separate basis as to why the NCLT Proceedings are vexatious or oppressive. While the defendant claims that an arbitral tribunal would have no jurisdiction over Ms Mani since she is not a party to the SHA, Mr Thio SC confirmed during the oral hearing and it was recorded by the court, that if necessary, Ms Mani is prepared to give an undertaking that she agrees to submit to any arbitration commenced by the defendant in Singapore in relation to the claims brought by the defendant in the NCLT Proceedings.

</div>
</div> All the other parties to the NCLT Proceedings (see [13] above) are parties to the SHA. Thus, this concern also falls away accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The fourth ground also does not afford strong reason and is, in my judgment, not relevant in this case. As I have found that the claims in the NCLT Proceedings have been brought in breach of the arbitration agreement, then as a matter of the parties’ contractual bargain, Singapore is where proceedings have to be brought. That is the positive aspect of the parties’ obligations under the arbitration agreement. Therefore, in that sense, it could be said that it is Singapore that is the natural and competent forum and not India (or the NCLT specifically). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 However, even if India is, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, the natural forum considering the connecting factors to the parties and the dispute, that is also immaterial because parties have contractually agreed to resolve their disputes by way of arbitration proceedings in Singapore. It therefore does not matter that India is where the parties and the dispute may have more substantial connections. Consideration of the natural forum to hear the dispute (in the traditional sense as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Cansulex </span>[1987] AC 460) should not figure in the court’s analysis when it is deciding whether to grant an anti-suit injunction to restrain conduct that is in breach of an arbitration agreement, and there is good reason why this should be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For one, it is entirely conceivable that Singapore may be chosen by commercial parties as the arbitral seat <span class="font-italic">precisely because</span> it has no connections to the parties or the transaction and is therefore a completely neutral forum. For a party to then contend that another forum is the natural forum and that affords strong reason <span class="font-italic">not</span> to grant an anti-suit injunction to enforce the parties’ contractual bargain would effectively render the parties’ autonomous choice nugatory. It also completely undermines the principle undergirding the grant of an anti-suit injunction in such circumstances which is to compel compliance with contractually agreed obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For all of the reasons mentioned above, I find that there is sufficient merit in the plaintiff’s application. I therefore allow OS 242 and grant a permanent anti-suit injunction against the defendant in the following terms: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">An injunction is granted restraining the defendant, his agents or otherwise from:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with the action commenced by the defendant by way of Company Petition No. 92 of 2021 in the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in Mumbai, India; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) commencing or procuring the commencement of any legal proceedings in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“People Interactive”), or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement dated 10 February 2006, as amended from time to time (the “SHA”) in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with the rules laid down by the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) and seated in Singapore, against the plaintiff, and/or Shobitha Annie Mani and/or Navin Mittal and/or Anand Mittal and/or People Interactive and/or any person in relation to any dispute relating to the management of People Interactive, or arising from, connected with or relating to any of the matters set out in the SHA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I note that while the plaintiff made brief submissions on the appropriateness of the scope of the injunction sought, the defendant has not done so, save for the point relating to Ms Mani which I have already addressed above at [89]. In any case, the scope of the injunction sought is, in the circumstances of this case, appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For completeness, it is unnecessary for me to decide on the matters raised in the defendant’s application in SUM 1477 to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> injunction granted in ORC 1463. As I heard full arguments <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> on OS 242 and have decided that a permanent anti-suit injunction should be granted, whether the interim injunction should be set aside is moot.
