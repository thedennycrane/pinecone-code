        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application to show cause arose from a
                    complaint to the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”)
                    against the respondent, an advocate and solicitor of some 16 years’
                    standing (“the Respondent”), by one
                    Mdm Sumathi d/o S Ramachandran (“the
                    Complainant”). According to the Complainant, a teacher at a Singapore
                    primary school (“the School”), the Respondent had threatened and
                    abused her verbally during a private meeting at the School (“the
                    Meeting”). The Meeting had been specifically convened to resolve certain
                    issues relating to the Respondent’s younger sister, a pupil at the
                    School.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After a two-day hearing in September, the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal rendered its report on 30 November 2009 (“the
                    Report”). In it, the Disciplinary Tribunal stated that the
                    Respondent’s conduct, although not occurring in her professional capacity,
                    nonetheless constituted cause of sufficient gravity pursuant to
                        s 93(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) so as to warrant a
                    reference to this court. The Disciplinary Tribunal further stated in its Report
                    (at [38]) that it did not possess the discretion to <em>refrain</em> from referring matters to the court of
                    three Judges, once all the elements of a disciplinary charge had been made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We were not concerned with the substantive
                    merits of the Law Society’s case against the Respondent. Instead, on a
                    preliminary issue, we agreed with the views of both the Law Society and the
                    Respondent that the Disciplinary Tribunal had misdirected itself in fettering
                    its own discretion to deal with the Respondent’s misconduct. Indeed, for
                    the reasons set out below, this application was misconceived and, in fact,
                    referred inappropriately by the Disciplinary Tribunal to this court. Before we
                    proceed to consider these reasons, however, a brief summary of the procedural
                    history of the case would be in order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 4 September 2008, the Complainant lodged
                    a complaint with the Law Society in respect of the Respondent’s alleged
                    misconduct at the Meeting. Subsequently, the Law Society preferred the following
                    charge (“the Charge”) against the Respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Charge</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel, Admission No. 250/1994
                        are charged that you, being an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court
                        of the Republic of Singapore, had conducted yourself in a manner that
                        amounts to misconduct unbefitting of an Advocate and Solicitor as an officer
                        of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the
                        meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act
                        (Chapter 161), to wit, by threatening to ensure that [the Complainant]
                        “will not be in the teaching profession anymore”; by banging
                        your fist on the table and the door of the meeting room; and by uttering the
                        following abusive words to [the Complainant], during a meeting at [the
                        School] on 15 July 2008:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    “She is such a swine” (shouted
                            twice);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    “I don’t know how many husbands you
                            have but our own family ladies doesn’t (<em>sic</em>) roll round with men” (at least once);
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    “This woman cannot have one father; she must
                            have several fathers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 18 May 2009, the Disciplinary Tribunal
                    was appointed to hear and investigate the complaint against the Respondent.
                    After a two-day hearing on 22 and 23 September 2009, the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal submitted the Report on 30 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Apart from making certain findings of fact that
                    this court is presently not concerned with, the Disciplinary Tribunal also
                    pronounced on the issue of its own discretion to refer – or <em>not</em> to refer – cases to the court of
                    three Judges. The Disciplinary Tribunal stated (at [38] of the Report) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is an intriguing discussion in the article “<em>Show Cause Proceedings Before the Court of Three Judges: Some
                            Procedural Questions</em>” (2008) 20 SAcLJ 801
                        (at [37]-[47]) by Goh Yihan, concerning whether a Disciplinary Committee
                        [presently known as the Disciplinary Tribunal] can determine that there is
                        no cause of sufficient gravity <em>despite</em> finding
                        the respondent guilty of all the ingredients of “due cause”
                        under s 83(2) of the Act. According to the learned author, <em>Disciplinary Committees have in the past taken the view that
                            although all the ingredients of the charge under s 83(2) of the Act
                            are fulfilled, they nonetheless have the power to take into account
                            mitigating factors so as to find that no cause of sufficient gravity
                            existed. He says that this is a “prevalent
                            practice”</em>. We would have adopted this practice and
                        invoked s 93(1)(b) of the Act in the present case. Whilst we have taken
                        a dim view of the Respondent’s conduct in relation to the Meeting, it
                        may be said that the conduct was not of such gravity or seriousness as to
                        necessitate referring it to the Court of Three Judges and that a stern
                        reprimand or an appropriate penalty seems apt. For sure, the conduct is
                        quite removed from that end of the spectrum of human frailties where
                        dishonesty and moral turpitude reside. <em>However, we are
                            persuaded by the contention in the article that, as provided in
                            s 83 of the Act, all advocates and solicitors are ultimately
                            subject to the control of the court and that when a charge under
                            s 83(2) of the Act is made out (that is, “due cause”
                            is established), a finding of cause of sufficient gravity for
                            disciplinary action is mandated under s 93(1) of the Act and the
                            Disciplinary Tribunal has no power or discretion to nevertheless find
                            that no such cause exists</em>. Nevertheless, we agree with the
                        learned author that the position should be clarified by the Court of Three
                        Judges. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Put simply, it appears that the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal decided that, based on the arguments advanced by Goh Yihan
                    (“Goh”) in his article (as cited by the Disciplinary Tribunal in
                    the Report (see the preceding paragraph)), “Show Cause Proceedings Before
                    the Court of Three Judges: Some Procedural Questions” (2008)
                    20 SAcLJ 801 (“the Article”) (at
                    paras 37–47), it had no choice but to refer the matter of the
                    Respondent’s misconduct to the court of three Judges once the
                    elements of the Charge had been made out. From the Disciplinary Tribunal’s
                    perspective, pursuant to ss 93(1)(<em>c</em>) and
                    94(1) of the Act, once “due cause” had been made out – in
                    this case under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act –
                    it would have <em>no</em> discretion <em>not</em> to transmit the Respondent’s case
                upwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The rationale for Goh’s view is set out
                    primarily at paras 40–41, 45 and 47 of the Article, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    The issue here is whether there is a difference
                            between the expressions “no cause of sufficient gravity”
                            and “due cause”, such that while the solicitor concerned
                            is found to be guilty of all the ingredients of a “due
                            cause” under s 83, he nonetheless can escape the
                            disciplinary powers of the Court of Three Judges should the
                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] decide that there was “no cause of
                            sufficient gravity”. The distinction is further borne out by
                            provisions such as ss 93(1)(b) and 94(3), which appear to
                            distinguish the meanings between “due cause” and
                            “no cause of sufficient gravity”. Put another way, these
                            sections seem to suggest that while there may well be a
                            “cause”, this can either be “not of sufficient
                            gravity” or <b><em>“of sufficient
                                gravity”, in which case it is a “due
                                cause”</em></b>. The question must then be asked: Is this a
                            conceptually sustainable distinction bearing in mind the framework
                            (quite apart from the <em>literal</em> sense) of
                            the statute?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    
              <em>Prima facie</em>, it is
                            submitted that this interpretation (<em>ie</em>,
                            the distinction outlined) <em>cannot</em> be
                            conceptually supported. In the first place, s 83(1) of the LPA
                            states expressly that all advocates and solicitors “<em>shall be subject to the control of the Supreme
                                Court</em>”. It does not say that all advocates and
                            solicitors are subject to the self-regulatory disciplinary framework of
                            their peers, <em>ie</em>, the [Disciplinary
                            Tribunal]. By not referring an advocate and solicitor who has been found
                            guilty of a charge formulated pursuant to s 83(2) of the LPA, the
                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] is in effect <em>usurping</em> the disciplinary powers of the Court of Three
                            Judges. Taken to its logical conclusion, a solicitor guilty of a
                            grievous “due cause” (for which the Court of Three Judges
                            will surely impose a heavy sentence) can escape the consequences of his
                            actions if the [Disciplinary Tribunal] nonetheless decides that
                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” exists. This cannot be
                            the case since the purpose of the Court of Three Judges is to
                            “vest ultimate control of the discipline of advocates and
                            solicitors in the court in order to provide a measure of independence
                            and impartiality”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    [I]t is submitted that the [Disciplinary Tribunal],
                            upon finding that the respondent is <b><em>guilty</em></b> of the charge against her, which encompasses
                                <em>all the ingredients</em> of a “due
                            cause” under s 83(2)(e), should have proceeded to refer the case
                            to the Court of Three Judges, without more. In other words, the words
                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” only apply to cases where
                            there is no “due cause”, and this is when the objective
                            ingredients of the specified due causes under s 83(2) are not made
                            out. There is no middle ground wherein the [Disciplinary Tribunal] can
                            find that there is <b><em>a “due cause” (or
                                rather, that the ingredients of a “due cause” are made
                                out)</em></b> but yet, in its <em>subjective</em> determination, decide that this is
                            “not of sufficient gravity”. It is further submitted that
                            the [Disciplinary Tribunal] should not determine that there was
                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” when “due
                            cause” was clearly shown to exist under s 83(2)(e), bearing
                            in mind that it is the Court of Three Judges in which ultimate
                            disciplinary powers are emplaced. If anything, it is for the Court of
                            Three Judges to decide whether the respondent’s conduct, <em>while falling within one of the “due
                                causes”</em>, merits lesser punishment. The residual
                            powers for the [Disciplinary Tribunal] to award lesser punishment under
                            provisions such as ss 93(1)(b) and 94(3), it is submitted, apply
                            only when there is no “due cause” and yet the
                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] is of the opinion that the respondent’s
                            conduct is nonetheless reprehensible and is deserving of some
                            sanction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    The problem, it seems, is that certain
                            [Disciplinary Tribunals] have taken the view that although the elements
                            of a charge formulated under instances of “due cause” in s
                            83(2) are fulfilled, they nonetheless have the power to take into
                            account mitigating factors so as to find that “no cause of
                            sufficient gravity” existed. With respect, this may not be

                                shown, must surely be to defer to the Court of Three Judges to
                                decide on the proper sanction to be meted out on the errant

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Goh’s view, which the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal accepted, is that a finding of “due cause” under
                    s 83 would <em>necessarily</em> imply (indeed, entail)
                    a “cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action” under
                    ss 93 and 94. In other words, Goh has <em>equated</em>
                    the two expressions (see the Article at paras 40–41, excerpted at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Accordingly, as the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal had, in the present proceedings, found that the elements
                    of the Charge against the Respondent had been made out pursuant to
                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act, it had no choice
                    but to refer the Respondent’s matter onwards to this court. This was
                        <em>despite</em> the Disciplinary Tribunal’s
                        <em>own conclusion</em> that “the
                    [Respondent’s] conduct … was not of such gravity or seriousness as
                    to necessitate referring it to the Court of Three Judges” (see the Report
                    at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     With respect, the approach adopted by both Goh
                    and the Disciplinary Tribunal should <em>not</em> be
                    adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Broadly speaking, the issue we are concerned
                    with here is whether the Disciplinary Tribunal has a <em>discretion</em> to refer cases to the court of three Judges, having
                    found that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one
                    or more of the limbs in s 83(2) (in other words, the elements of the charge
                    against the advocate and solicitor have been made out). In our view, it is clear
                    that this issue turns, to a large extent, on whether there is a distinction
                    between the phrase “cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action
                    exists under [s 83]” in ss 93 and 94 of the Act on the one hand
                    and the phrase “due cause” in s 83 of the Act on the other.
                    It would also turn on whether a finding that the conduct of the advocate and
                    solicitor concerned falls within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2)
                    automatically amounts to a finding of “due cause” under s 83,
                    as well as the roles played by the court of three Judges and the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Given the very nature of the issue itself and
                    the fact that it would, to a large extent, turn on the question of distinction
                    between the two phrases referred to in the preceding paragraph, it would be
                    appropriate, at this juncture, to set out the material provisions in order to
                    obtain an understanding of the context in which each phrase

                    here faced with two completely different phrases, <em>viz</em>, “cause of sufficient gravity exists under

                    piece of legislation – indeed, the same piece of legislation. We can,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     However, s 31 of the 1970 Amendment
                    Act amended the provision set out in the preceding paragraph, which thereafter

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Indeed, the words – or, more accurately,
                    the change in the words and the terminology - speak for
                    themselves. In particular, the phrase “cause of sufficient
                    gravity” replaced the phrase “due cause” in the then
                    s 96(1) of the Act (which is the present s 93(1) of the Act,
                    reproduced above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>). In this
                    connection, it should be borne in mind, of course, that the phrase “cause
                    of sufficient gravity” relates to <em>disciplinary action
                        under the then s 87 of the Act</em> (<em>the
                        present s 83 of the Act</em>, the material parts of which have
                    been reproduced above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>). This
                    last-mentioned point is important inasmuch as both ss 87(1)(<em>b</em>) and 88(1) of the Act <em>also</em> utilise the phrase “cause of sufficient
                    gravity”, <em>albeit in relation to the absence of the
                        need for a “formal investigation” by a Disciplinary
                        Tribunal</em> (see both ss 87(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    and 88(1) where the phrase “no <em>cause of sufficient
                        gravity</em> exists for a <em>formal
                        investigation</em>” is employed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Put simply, and returning to the issue at
                    hand, the legislative history demonstrates – in no uncertain terms
                        - that the phrase “cause of sufficient
                    gravity” was not only intended to replace the phrase “due
                    cause” in the context of proceedings before <em>a
                        Disciplinary Tribunal but was also intended to carry a quite different
                        meaning from the phrase “due cause”</em>. This is, in
                    fact, an appropriate juncture at which to turn to the next (related) question:
                    What, then, <em>was</em> the <em>legislative
                        purpose</em> underlying this particular amendment (and the consequent
                    substitution of phrases)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parliamentary materials</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There does not appear to be any <em>express</em> delineation of the legislative purpose for the
                    changes effected. In the <em>Explanatory Statement</em> to
                    the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill 6 of 1970) (which was
                    ultimately enacted as the 1970 Amendment Act), it was stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Legal Profession Act, 1966, introduced a large number of novel
                        provisions. It has been found in the light of the operation of the Act that
                        certain amendments would be desirable for the more efficient organisation of
                        the legal profession and also to take into account the functions of other
                        professions, such as public accountants. This Bill seeks to make such
                        amendments as are necessary to give effect to such changes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     More <em>specifically</em>, the <em>Explanatory
                        Statement</em> also elaborated on cl 31 of this Bill (which was
                    ultimately enacted as s 31 of the 1970 Amendment Act, which amended the
                    then s 96(1) of the Act (the present s 93(1)) (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above)), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill also enlarges the powers of the Disciplinary Committee and the
                        Inquiry Committee. <em>As a result of these amendments the
                            Disciplinary Committee can reprimand an advocate and solicitor when the
                            case against him is not of sufficient gravity but it cannot in such
                            cases order payment of a penalty (clause 31)</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Hence, the focus of s 31 of the
                    1970 Amendment Act was, as just noted in the preceding paragraph, on
                    enlarging the power of the (then) Disciplinary Committee inasmuch as it could
                    reprimand an advocate and solicitor (but not order the payment of a penalty),
                    despite finding that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action
                    existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The more interesting <em>consequential</em> amendments in the context of the present
                    proceedings lie in the fact that the phrase “sufficient <em>cause</em>” in s 96(1)(<em>b</em>) (the present s 93(1)(<em>b</em>))
                    was <em>replaced by</em> the phrase “cause of
                    sufficient <em>gravity</em>”. Further, the phrase
                        “<em>due cause</em>” in
                        s 96(1)(<em>a</em>) <em>and</em> (<em>c</em>) (the present
                        s 93(1)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>c</em>), respectively) was <em>replaced by</em>
                    the phrase “cause of sufficient gravity” (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). <em>However</em>, there appears to be <em>no</em>
                    explanation in either the <em>Explanatory Statement</em> to
                    the Bill concerned or in the relevant Parliament Debates (see generally
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (30 March 1970) vol 29 at
                    cols 1271–1273 (Mr E W Barker, Minister for Law and
                    National Development)) as to <em>why</em> these <em>consequential</em> amendments were made. The only clear fact
                    is the change of the phrases themselves. Henceforth, the Disciplinary Committee
                    (now Disciplinary Tribunal) would be concerned with whether or not there has
                    been “<em>cause of sufficient gravity</em>”
                    <em>for disciplinary action against the advocate and solicitor
                        concerned pursuant to s 83</em> – as opposed to
                        “<em>due cause</em>” (which constituted
                    the previous position (<em>prior to</em> the
                    1970 Amendment Act)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The roles played by the court of three Judges and the Disciplinary
                Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The court of three Judges bears the ultimate responsibility for
                deciding on the most serious cases of misconduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It would, in the circumstances, therefore be
                    useful to commence our analysis from first principles. And one such principle is
                    that <em>the Supreme Court</em> in general and the court of
                    three Judges in particular (see s 98(7) of the Act) bear the ultimate
                    responsibility for deciding on the most serious cases of misconduct by advocates
                    and solicitors. Indeed, this is embodied in s 83(1) of the Act. Although
                    that provision has already been reproduced above (at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>), it is worth reproducing again: “All advocates and
                    solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court …”
                    (reference may also be made to s 82A(2) of the Act, which relates to the
                    equivalent provision in the context of disciplinary proceedings against legal
                    service officers and non-practising solicitors). The starting point, therefore,
                    is that the Supreme Court (in the form of the court of three Judges) is the
                        <em>ultimate</em> tribunal having control over all
                    advocates and solicitors. However, it should be appreciated that it does
                        <em>not</em> follow from <em>this</em> fact <em>per se</em> that the court of
                    three Judges <em>must</em> necessarily hear <em>all</em> cases where the Disciplinary Tribunal finds that the
                    advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of the limbs of
                    s 83(2) of the Act (<em>cf</em> para 41 of the
                    Article, excerpted at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). In our
                    view, it is only the <em>most serious cases</em> that must
                    be heard by the court of three Judges. That the Supreme Court (in the form of
                    the court of three Judges) is the <em>ultimate (and
                        only)</em> tribunal for deciding on the <em>most
                        serious cases</em> is borne out by the fact that it is also accorded
                    (in s 83(1) of the Act (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>)) the power to administer the <em>most
                        serious sanctions</em> against an errant advocate and solicitor. This
                    power includes administering the most severe sanction of striking such an
                    advocate and solicitor off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme
                    Court. It is also important to note that there is <em>no further
                        appeal</em> from such a decision (see s 98(7) of the
                Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At this juncture, it should be further noted
                    that it is <em>for the court of three Judges to decide and
                        it must decide on whether or not “due cause” has been proved
                        in the first instance</em>; in other words, <em>the
                        mere reference</em> of a case to the court of three Judges is
                        <em>not</em> a <em>fait
                        accompli</em> in so far as the <em>liability</em>
                    of the advocate and solicitor is concerned. This is an important point, to which
                    we shall return below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of the Disciplinary Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Disciplinary Tribunal is not responsible for deciding
                upon the most serious cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The upshot of what has just been discussed in
                    the preceding section is that <em>the Disciplinary
                        Tribunal</em> does <em>not</em> possess powers to
                    decide upon the <em>most serious cases</em>, <em>let alone</em> administer the <em>most serious
                        sanctions</em>. As we have seen, this is the task of the court of
                    three Judges. Put simply, it is <em>not</em> the
                        <em>ultimate</em> disciplinary tribunal. What, then,
                        <em>is</em> the <em>function</em>
                    of <em>the Disciplinary Tribunal</em> pursuant to s 93
                    (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>)? <em>This is, in fact, one of the most crucial questions to be answered
                        in the context of the present proceedings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The <em>function</em> (or
                    rather, functions) of <em>the Disciplinary Tribunal</em>
                    may be gleaned from the relevant provisions of the Act itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Disciplinary Tribunal as a
                “filter”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     One main function of the Disciplinary Tribunal
                    is <em>to serve as a “filter” of sorts, thereby
                        ensuring that only the most serious complaints are referred to the court of
                        three Judges</em>. This is, in fact, clear from the provisions of
                    s 93 itself (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>).
                    It is of the first importance to reiterate that the Disciplinary Tribunal does
                        <em>not decide</em> on the most serious cases. If it
                    decides that a particular complaint is sufficiently serious <em>and</em> that there is a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case against the advocate and solicitor concerned after hearing the relevant
                    evidence, the Disciplinary Tribunal must <em>refer</em> the
                    case <em>for decision by the court of
                        three Judges</em>. On the other hand, it is both logical as well
                    as commonsensical that the court of three Judges <em>not</em> be “clogged up” with hearing cases of a
                    trivial (and, <em>a fortiori</em>, frivolous) nature.
                    Indeed, the same approach with a view to avoiding unnecessary logjams was, in
                    fact, adopted at a <em>lower</em> level <em>via</em> s 17 of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2001
                    (Act 35 of 2001) which amended s 85 “to enable the Chairman of
                    the Inquiry Panel to constitute one or more <em>Review
                        Committees</em> (comprising an advocate and solicitor and a legal
                    officer) to review complaints or information against advocates and solicitors
                    and to dismiss any complaint if the Review Committee is of the unanimous opinion
                    that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in
                    substance” [emphasis added] (see the <em>Explanatory
                        Statement</em> to the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill 39
                    of 2001)). Indeed, the following observations by the Minister for Law,
                    Prof S Jayakumar, during the second reading of this Bill, bear
                    quotation (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 83 at
                    cols 2195–2196):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prior to 1986, the Council could only refer to the Chairman of the Inquiry
                        Panel those complaints relating to the conduct of a lawyer in his
                        professional capacity. The Council therefore weeded out those complaints
                        which did not relate to a lawyer’s professional conduct. In 1986, the
                        Act was amended to allow any complaints relating to any conduct of a lawyer,
                        not just conduct in his professional capacity. This was because, sometimes,
                        misconduct by a lawyer, even in his private capacity, may be sufficient to
                        render him unfit to continue being a member of the honourable profession.
                        The Council thereafter acted on the assumption that they should continue to
                        play a sifting role in the post-1986 regime. However<em>, the
                            Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the Council should not be
                            performing such a sifting function, but should simply forward all
                            complaints to be dealt with by the Inquiry Committees</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Sir, this is not practical and has resulted in some
                            difficulties</em>. The Law Society receives more than
                        100 complaints a year. More than half of them are without substance and
                        are sifted out by the Council, while the remainder goes to an Inquiry
                        Committee for a full inquiry. <em>If the Council is not to
                            sift, the caseload on the Inquiry Committees will more than
                            double</em>. Each Inquiry Committee is made up of two lawyers of
                        at least 12 years’ standing, a Legal Service Officer of at least
                        10 years' experience as well as a lay person. Doubling the caseload of
                        the Inquiry Committees will create a serious strain on scarce resources and
                        slow down the disciplinary process. Therefore a new machinery known as the
                        Review Committee will be set up to act as a sifting mechanism.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">There is, in our view, no reason in <em>principle</em> why similar reasoning ought not to apply to the
                    situation in the present proceedings (which relates to the
                    “sifting” function of the Disciplinary Tribunal
                instead).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Conceptual and practical difficulties arising under the
                statutory language in the then s 96 prior to the 1970 Amendment Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As we have seen, the relevant provision
                        <em>prior to the 1970 Amendment Act</em> was the
                    former s 96(1) (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>). The Disciplinary Committee (now known as the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal) was tasked <em>then</em> with determining that
                        “<em>due cause</em>” did not exist for
                    disciplinary action pursuant to what is now s 83 <em>or</em> that while no “<em>sufficient
                        cause</em>” existed for such disciplinary action the advocate
                    and solicitor concerned should be ordered to pay a penalty <em>or</em> that “<em>due cause</em>”
                    for disciplinary action pursuant to what is now s 83 <em>did
                        exist</em>. In this last-mentioned of the three possible
                    determinations that could have been arrived at by the Disciplinary Committee,
                    the Disciplinary Committee would then <em>refer</em> the
                    case <em>to the court of three Judges</em> for
                        <em>its decision</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     
          <em>However</em>, the
                        <em>previous terminology</em> (of “<em>due cause</em>”) in the then s 96 of the Act (the
                    present s 93 (which, of course, contains quite different terminology))
                    could – conceptually, if not practically – raise unnecessary
                    question marks <em>vis-à-vis</em> the role and function of
                    the Disciplinary Committee. If the determination of the Disciplinary Committee
                    (now known as the Disciplinary Tribunal) was, indeed, <em>a
                        finding of “due cause”</em> (pursuant to the terminology
                    under the then s 96(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act
                    (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>)), then <em>the Disciplinary Committee would have usurped the function of the
                        court of three Judges as only the latter could make</em> a <em>decision</em> as to whether or not there was
                        “<em>due cause</em>” pursuant to the then
                    s 87 of the Act (the present s 83 of the Act) and, on arriving at such
                    a decision, <em>administer the appropriate sanction</em>
                    under the then s 87(1) of the Act (the present s 83(1)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The conceptual and practical difficulties removed by the
                1970 Amendment Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     
          <em>Put simply, a determination
                        or finding of “due cause” as such was not – and is not
                        – within the purview of the Disciplinary Tribunal</em>. This is
                    why, in our view, the amendment effected by the 1970 Amendment Act (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>) was necessary. It will be
                    recalled that the 1970 Amendment Act <em>substituted</em> the phrase “due cause” wherever it
                    appeared in the then s 96 of the Act (the present s 93 (as amended))
                        <em>with the phrase “cause of sufficient
                        gravity”</em>. In other words, the phrase “<em>cause of sufficient gravity</em>” was intended, in our
                    view, to represent <em>a determination by the Disciplinary
                        Committee (now known as the Disciplinary Tribunal) that there was
                        a</em> prima facie <em>case on the relevant evidence
                        that “due cause” might be present and that, in the
                        circumstances, the case ought to be referred to the court of
                        three Judges</em>. In other words, a finding that “cause
                    of sufficient gravity” exists was <em>not</em> a
                        <em>determination or finding of “due cause” as
                        such</em>; rather, the Disciplinary Tribunal (as the Disciplinary
                    Committee is now known) would be performing a “<em>filtering</em>” or “<em>sifting</em>” function <em>in order to ensure
                        that less serious (and</em>, a fortiori, <em>trivial or
                        frivolous) cases</em> are <em>not</em> referred
                    to the court of three Judges. Indeed, such cases would fall, instead,
                    within the ambit of s 93(1)(<em>a</em>) <em>or</em> (<em>b</em>) (reproduced above
                    at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The <em>first</em>
                    provision referred to at the end of the preceding paragraph, <em>viz</em>, s 93(1)(<em>a</em>), relates to a
                    situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal has determined there is <em>no (potential or</em> prima facie<em>) merit
                        in the sense described above, and should therefore proceed no
                        further</em>. A clear example of such a case would be one where the
                    conduct of the advocate and solicitor does <em>not fall within
                        any</em> of the limbs in s 83(2) to begin with. Indeed, we would
                    think that this would, <em>practically speaking</em>, be
                    the <em>main (if not the only)</em> situation because, if
                    the conduct of the advocate and solicitor falls within one or more of the limbs
                    in s 83(2), we should think that there should be <em>some
                        sanction</em> administered to that advocate and solicitor. This is, as
                    we shall see in the following paragraph, precisely what s 93(1)<em>(b)</em> envisages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Following from the analysis in the preceding
                    paragraph, the <em>second</em> provision, <em>viz</em>, s 93(1)(<em>b</em>),
                    relates to a situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal, whilst of the view
                    that there is <em>no (potential or</em> prima
                        facie<em>) merit in the sense described above</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, that “due cause” might be
                    found by a court of three Judges), is <em>nevertheless</em> of the view that <em>some (lesser)
                        sanction</em> should be administered against the advocate and
                    solicitor concerned. One clear situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal can
                    administer such a (lesser) sanction relates to a situation where the conduct of
                    the advocate and solicitor concerned is found to come within one or more of the
                    limbs in s 83(2) (in our view, such conduct is more likely than not to fall
                    within s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) (given its nature as a
                    “catch-all provision” (see <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Ng Chee Sing</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 at [40]
                    and <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul
                        Ghani</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [79])), as is, indeed, the
                    case here) but falls short of a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    of “due cause” that ought to be referred to a court of
                    three Judges for decision. Whether or not the Disciplinary Tribunal can
                    administer a similar sanction in relation to a situation which does not come
                    within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) was not an issue before us and
                    we therefore do not make any pronouncement on it, although it would appear that
                        <em>the Council of the Law Society</em> has the power
                    to administer a sanction in such a situation pursuant to the power conferred
                    upon it under s 88 of the Act where “no cause of sufficient gravity
                    exists for a formal investigation” by a Disciplinary Tribunal (see Tan
                    Yock Lin, <em>The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore
                        and West Malaysia</em> (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at
                    pp 778–779 (citing <em>Hilborne v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [1977–1978] SLR(R) 342)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As we have already seen, however, there is yet
                    a <em>third</em> situation (under s 93(1)(<em>c</em>)) in which the Disciplinary Tribunal determines that
                    there <em>is (potential or</em> prima facie<em>) merit in the complaint and that the case should therefore be
                        referred to the court of three Judges</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A summary of our findings and views above</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     A point already mentioned (above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>) is of such fundamental importance to these
                    proceedings that it bears repeating: <em>It is of the first
                        importance to note that a finding by the Disciplinary Tribunal that the
                        conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one or more of
                        the limbs in s 83(2) does not</em>, ipso facto<em>, entail a finding of “due cause”</em>. Put simply, a
                    determination that the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one
                    or more of the limbs in s 83(2) is <em>a necessary –
                        but not sufficient – condition for a finding of “due
                        cause”</em>. This interpretation is consistent with the use of
                    the word “<em>may</em>” in s 83(2)
                    itself. Whether or not there <em>is, in fact</em>,
                        “<em>due cause</em>” (meriting a
                        <em>sanction</em> pursuant to s 83(1)) will (as
                    already mentioned above) be determined by <em>the court of
                        three Judges, having regard to all the facts and surrounding
                        circumstances in the application before it – of which a threshold
                        finding that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls
                        within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) is necessary</em>.
                    Indeed, as we have also noted, the court of three Judges might even find
                    – contrary to the finding of the Disciplinary Tribunal – that the
                    facts of the application before it do <em>not</em> even
                    fall within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) to begin with (in which
                    case no action whatsoever will be taken against the advocate and solicitor
                    concerned). If, however, the court of three Judges determines that
                    “due cause”
                    <em>has</em> been shown, it can <em>then
                        administer the appropriate sanction</em> (pursuant to s 83(1) of
                    the Act (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As already noted above (at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>), the construction we have placed on
                    ss 93 and 83 is also consistent with logic and commonsense inasmuch as the
                    court of three Judges is not faced with a logjam of unnecessary cases of a
                    trivial (and, <em>a fortiori</em>, frivolous) nature.
                    Further, this construction is, as we have sought to demonstrate, wholly
                    consistent with the legislative history as well as purpose of the provisions (in
                    particular, that relating to the introduction of the phrase “cause of
                    sufficient gravity” into the present s 93 by way of the
                    1970 Amendment Act). At this juncture, we note that whilst the Article is,
                    in the main, a reasoned and learned one from one of Singapore’s most
                    promising young legal scholars, the particular proposition was based on a wrong
                        <em>premise</em> inasmuch as the Article, in effect,
                        <em>equated (and conflated)</em> “cause of
                    sufficient gravity” with “due cause” (see also the Article
                    at para 40, reproduced above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As we have explained above, the phrase
                    “cause of sufficient gravity” was deliberately as well as
                    specifically introduced in order to clarify that the task of <em>the Disciplinary Tribunal</em> was to act as a “<em>filter</em>” in order to determine whether or not
                    there was a case of “sufficient gravity” that <em>could</em>, on a finding by the court of three Judges, be
                    ascertained (based <em>not only</em> on the case falling
                    within one or more of the limbs of s 83(2) <em>but
                        also</em> on the <em>gravity and seriousness of the
                        conduct based on the evidence</em>) to constitute “<em>due cause</em>” that merited the requisite <em>sanction</em> from a range of sanctions prescribed under
                    s 83(1). If so, then the Disciplinary Tribunal would <em>refer the case accordingly to a court of three Judges</em>
                    pursuant to s 93(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act. The
                    aforementioned <em>equation (and conflation)</em> in the
                    Article occurred because the learned author <em>equated the
                        establishment of “due cause” with the establishment of the
                        ingredients in one or more of the limbs under s 83(2) of the
                        Act</em>. That this is so is clear from para 45 of the Article
                    reproduced above (at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>). <em>However</em>, this is, with respect, erroneous because, as we have
                    already explained, a finding that the advocate and solicitor’s conduct
                    falls within one or more of the limbs of s 83(2) of the Act is, at most, a
                        <em>threshold</em> requirement to the <em>ultimate</em> determination that “due cause”
                    has been <em>established</em>. In any event, a
                    determination by <em>the Disciplinary Tribunal</em> that
                    the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of the limbs
                    of s 83(2) of the Act is <em>by no means conclusive as the
                        final decision lies with the court of three Judges</em>. Indeed,
                    the court of three Judges not only makes the final decision as to whether
                    or not the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of
                    the limbs of s 83(2), <em>but also whether that conduct
                        constitutes “due cause” for the purposes of the administering
                        of a sanction pursuant to s 83(1) of the Act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As we have also explained, if the Disciplinary
                    Tribunal finds – at the other extreme – that the conduct of the
                    advocate and solicitor concerned does not even fall within any of the limbs in
                    s 83(2) to begin with, then it would <em>not</em> take
                        <em>any further action whatsoever</em> (see
                        s 93(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act as well as above at
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the final situation (which seems to us to
                    be an “<em>intermediate</em>” one), the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal may find that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor
                    concerned <em>does</em> fall within one or more of the
                    limbs of s 83(2) (which is more likely than not, as pointed out above at
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>, to fall within
                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>)) <em>but</em> feels that the conduct itself, whilst <em>technically</em> within the ambit of one or more of these limbs, is
                    nevertheless <em>not</em> one of “sufficient
                    gravity” to merit a reference to the court of three Judges. In other
                    words, the Disciplinary Tribunal is of the view that there is – on the
                    facts and circumstances before it –
                    <em>no prima facie</em> case that would result in a finding
                    of “<em>due cause</em>” by the court of
                    three Judges, bearing in mind (as explained above) a finding of
                        “<em>due cause</em>” is <em>not</em>, <em>ipso facto</em>,
                    demonstrated <em>merely</em> by a finding that the conduct
                    of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one or more of the limbs of
                    s 83(2). In this (final) situation, the Disciplinary Tribunal can
                    administer a much less serious sanction pursuant to s 93(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act (see also above at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion and practical considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The conclusion which we have arrived at
                    – to the effect that the Disciplinary Tribunal <em>does</em> possess the discretion to <em>refrain</em> from referring matters to the court of three Judges
                    even if all the ingredients of a disciplinary charge had been made out –
                    is not only consistent with the language as well as legislative history and
                    purpose of the relevant provisions but is also consistent with <em>practical</em> considerations as well. We have already noted
                    the practical benefits which result from the “sifting” function
                    exercised in this manner by the Disciplinary Tribunal. We also note –
                    parenthetically – that a <em>contrary</em> approach
                    (which would result in <em>automatic</em> reference of
                    cases to the court of three Judges) would act as a disincentive to the
                    advocate and solicitor concerned to admit his or her guilt before the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal (even for relatively trivial charges). This would, in
                    turn, result in a greater number of <em>full</em> hearings
                    before Disciplinary Tribunals, thereby increasing the average time taken to
                    dispose of complaints. Such a result would necessarily run counter to the
                    legislative spirit of the Act itself, which (at s 93(3) of the Act)
                    specifically tasks a Disciplinary Tribunal to “carry out its work
                    expeditiously”. It turns out that the prevalent practice of Disciplinary
                    Tribunals – which adopts, in fact, the approach which we have endorsed
                    – was correct all along.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the reasons set out above, we dismissed
                    the Law Society’s application and made no order as to costs. We also
                    remitted the matter to the same Disciplinary Tribunal for it to decide on the
                    appropriate form of punishment for the Respondent.</p>
