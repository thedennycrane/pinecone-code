The Target Companies were owned by a Singapore registered company, Yong Gui Investment Pte Ltd (“YGIPL”). The plan of the two key players, Henry Wong Kok Hwee and Simon Liong Chung Yee, was to acquire YGIPL, and to deploy a core group of personnel experienced in cold chain logistics, led by Mr Wong, to exploit its business potential. YG Group Pte Ltd (“YGG”) was incorporated in Singapore on 27 January 2015 for this purpose.

Finally, Mr Wong brought Suit No 107 of 2017 alleging conspiracy and requesting the court to wind up YGG.

</div> The plan proposed the setting up of a joint venture company to acquire the Target Companies. The “information pack” prepared by Mr Wong contained detailed profiles of Dennis Seen, Lou Lin and Maglin Chng, who were identified as “Industry Veterans and key specialists” in the cold chain logistics industry. Mr Wong proposed that he could, together with the three individuals introduced, form a core management team which would make the Target Companies more profitable.

Mr Wong required a loan of S$4,000,000 to be made to MCH, to enable MCH to have sufficient cash to put in its initial contribution to the joint venture. Mr Wong explained to Mr Liong that he needed cash as his assets were tied up at the time.

</div> Because this placed the financial risk of the venture wholly on Mr Liong, Mr Liong emphasised that in the circumstances he needed full confidence on the due diligence that was to be conducted on the Target Companies. Mr Wong reassured Mr Liong that he had 14 years of industry and mergers &amp; acquisitions experience and the firms he had chosen to lead the financial and legal due diligence were “the best in the market”.

Parties therefore agreed on an amended plan (the “Revised Acquisition Model”). In the Revised Acquisition Model, no security was necessary. The Target Companies were to be purchased in two phases, with full control of the companies deferred to the second phase. The first tranche would be a payment of US$4,400,000 for 40% of the issued share capital in YGIPL with an option to purchase the remaining 60% for US$6,600,000 within 12 months.

</div> In Mr Liong’s view, the KV Asia Offer would have benefited individuals or entities close to Mr Wong (such as Mr Iskandar, all the members of the core management team except for Mr Ang, and Mr Wong’s acquisition advisors) at the expense of YGL. It involved a dilution of YGL’s share in YGG, while MCH and a company owned by Mr Shortell would enjoy share premiums. The core management team would benefit from additional management incentives, but Mr Ang was left out of any such incentives. Mr Iskandar would be made President Director of one of the other logistics companies while Mr Liong would lose his seat on the Board of Directors of YGG.

Mr Wong also gave two additional reasons (aside from asset tagging) to explain why he refused to allow the exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option. First, the dispute over the KV Asia Offer, as well the dispute relating to the payment of due diligence costs (see [23] above) had cost YGG time, and led to a delay in the process of preparing for the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. Second, Mr Wong explained that “so long as we do not have full clarify [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] on the final year’s number, we cannot exercise the option to buy the 60%”.

In the meeting, Mr Wong put forward his position that YGG would not exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option until a second financial due diligence exercise (“Second Due Diligence”), commenced by the same auditors who led the first financial due diligence exercise, was completed. The Second Due Diligence could only commence after 15 March 2016, as the particular auditors that Mr Wong wanted to lead the due diligence exercise was not available till that date. Mr Liong objected to a delay in the due diligence exercise and expressed the view that the Purchaser’s Call Option had to be exercised as soon as possible. Mr Wong’s rebuttal was that it was his duty as the Managing Director of YGG to ensure that proper due diligence was done before exercising the option. Mr Wong noted several concerns found in the YGIPL’s financial reports that he felt needed to be addressed before the exercise of the option.

He was concerned that if the Purchaser’s Call Option lapsed, the Vendors would buy back the 40% of YGIPL at a 10% discount, causing loss to YGG. He was also worried that given that Mr Seen had yet to be deployed to Shanghai, there would be insufficient time left for YGG to learn and take over the business of the Target Companies. Mr Liong resolved to take control of the situation. He emailed his desire to have YGG be immediately involved in the operations of the Target Companies, by having Mr Ang be deployed to China in Mr Seen’s intended role, since Mr Seen had yet to be seconded to YGG.

</div> Suit 104, however, was filed on 3 February 2016, prior to the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, and this is the determinative date. The proper focus of the inquiry should be whether, as at 3 February 2016, Mr Wong was in breach of the Deed of Undertakings. The important question was, therefore, when the obligation to second the core management team <span class="font-italic">arose, </span>and whether it had crystallised by 3 February 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I start with the observation that the term “completion of the Acquisition” is not defined in the Deed of Undertakings. This is because <span class="font-italic">the context </span><span class="font-italic">in which the document was signed </span>was that there would be full acquisition of the Target Companies on the first disbursement of funds. Thus in recital (B) of the Deed of Undertakings, the word “Acquisition” is defined as the point when “[YGL] cooperated with [MCH] (which is controlled by [Mr Wong]) and established [YGG] to acquire the interest in [the Target Companies] in cold chain logistic businesses … ”.

He clarified in his closing arguments that his argument was that the obligations were “<span class="font-weight-bold">not yet</span> enforceable”: that is, that “[t]he Deed of Undertakings envisioned a state of affairs where YGG had full management control of YGIPL in order for [Mr Wong] to then deploy the Core Management Team to take over the management of YGIPL” [emphasis in original].

</div> Thus, Mr Wong’s defence on this point rests on the premise that his obligation to procure the hiring and secondment of the core management team under the Deed of Undertakings would only arise after YGG had fully acquired all the shares in YGIPL. Mr Lobo and Mr Soh’s case, on the other hand, rests on the assertion that the obligation arose at the point where the 40% stake in YGIPL was acquired. Therefore, after closing submissions, the two competing interpretations for the phrase “completion of the Acquisition” were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The time when YGG first acquired the 40% interest in the Target Companies; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The time when YGG acquired the full ownership interest in the Target Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I hold, for the reasons below, that interpretation (a) better reflects the objective intention of the parties, because of the other contractual documents signed at the time of the acquisition of the 40% interest, and parties’ conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I turn to the issue of the surrounding documents. I deal first with the Loan Agreement, amended on 18 August 2015. In the Amendment Agreement (in respect of the Loan Agreement), the definition of “Transaction Documents” in the original Loan Agreement was deleted in its entirety and substituted with a new list of “Transaction Documents”. The new list included at (h), the Deed of Undertakings.

This intention is evident from the symmetry in the provisions highlighted in the SPA and clauses 1(b)–(d) of the Deed of Undertakings. The SPA suggests that certain nominees of YGG would be granted a role in YGIPL after the purchase of 40% of the YGIPL shares. The Deed of Undertakings, if interpreted in the manner suggested by Mr Lobo and Mr Soh, would facilitate the operation of these provisions, because the core management team would be hired by MCH upon “Completion” as defined in the SPA. The core management team would then be seconded to YGG, whereupon they could be nominated to fill the roles in YGIPL as delineated in the SPA. If, on the other hand, the Deed of Undertakings were to be interpreted in the manner suggested by Mr Wijaya, it would be difficult to imagine how YGG would be able to find appropriate nominees for the roles delineated in the SPA without any employees to send to YGIPL. Further, clause 7.7 of the SPA suggests that the parties contemplated that such nominees would be employees of YGG, since it expressly states that the wages of the understudy would be paid by YGG. Hence, the interpretation put forward by Mr Lobo and Mr Soh appears to be more consistent with the plans envisioned by the parties, as seen in light of the other contracting documents that were signed on 18–19 August 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The contemporaneous conduct of all parties also confirms the interpretation put forward by Mr Lobo and Mr Soh. Three strands of evidence are of particular relevance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, the negotiations over the terms of the SPA demonstrate that Mr Wong was operating on the premise that the core management team would be seconded to YGG by the time the 40% stake in YGIPL was purchased. Mr Wong was the main point of contact YGG’s side during the negotiations over the SPA, and it was clear that Mr Wong had expressly negotiated for YGG to have the benefit of the roles set out in clause 7. In an email dated 3 March 2015 sent by Mr Wong to Mr Lim, he asked that upon the purchase of the 40% stake in YGIPL:

Rather, when challenged by Mr Liong at the time, Mr Wong sought to highlight the work already done by the core management team. For example, in the reply to Mr Liong’s email of 26 January 2016 (see [31] above), Mr Wong, in response to the demand to hire and second the core management team, did not state that it was premature to second the core management team , and instead highlighted the work already done by the team, stating that his “team were actually in constant communication with [YGIPL] such as coordination of the asset tagging and follow up questions [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”. Indeed, Mr Wong took the position in the same email that he would have “sent [his] team in” if not for the disputes over the sharing of due diligence costs two weeks before he was about to send the aforementioned team.

In fact, even on 21 March 2016, Mr Wong had yet to articulate the defence that the obligations under the Deed of Undertakings would only come into effect after the full 100% stake in YGIPL was purchased.

</div> Mr Wong’s defence also shifted in the middle of trial, where for the first time, he abruptly claimed that the examples of work done by the core management team was done “in good faith”.

</div> During the earlier period between 21 December 2015 to 21 March 2016, Mr Wong had sought to emphasise these examples as evidence of him fulfilling his obligations under the Deed of Undertakings (see [73] above). The shifting nature of Mr Wong’s defence, culminating in its present form, further underscores the fact that Mr Wijaya’s proposed interpretation does not reflect the objective intention of the parties. In my view, this was merely the latest in a series of attempts by Mr Wong to avoid liability under the Deed of Undertakings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, Mr Wijaya mounts an alternative argument on the breach of the Deed of Undertakings: he submits that Mr Wong did carry out some work on behalf of YGG, including procurement of trucking assets, representing YGG in shareholders’ meetings and coaching Mr Ang in the asset tagging exercise.

</div> However, clauses 1(b)–(d) of the Deed of Undertakings specify that Mr Wong had to use his best efforts to hire and second the core management team to YGG and the work personally done by Mr Wong had no bearing on these obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the circumstances, I find that the proper interpretation of the phrase “completion of the Acquisition” within the Deed of Undertakings meant, and was understood by all parties to mean, the point when YGG acquired 40% of YGIPL. It follows that Mr Wong’s obligation was to procure the team within a reasonable time thereafter. His continued failure to do so meant that he was in breach of the Deed of Undertakings as at 3 February 2016, when Suit 104 was filed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">MCH’s obligations under the Deed of Undertakings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 MCH did not sign the Deed of Undertakings. Mr Wong, YGL and YGG are the contracting parties to it. Mr Soh rests his argument, that MCH is a party to the deed, upon Mr Wong’s authority to bind MCH: in particular, that Mr Wong, “being the controlling mind and will and de facto managing director of MCH, had the express and/or implied authority to act for and enter into the Deed of Undertakings”.

</div> Authority alone, nevertheless, is not sufficient. There is no doubt that Mr Wong has such authority. If not, the other documents signed by Mr Wong on behalf of MCH, such as the Subscription Agreement, would not bind MCH due to lack of authority. It does not, however, follow that merely because Mr Wong has authority to bind MCH, every contract that he signs does so bind MCH, even where MCH is not expressed as a contracting party. MCH’s responsibility must arise from a proper interpretation of the Deed of Undertakings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 YGL makes three arguments to hold MCH responsible. First, the Deed of Undertakings appears to impose obligations on MCH, such as an obligation to hire members of the core management team, and to bear their salaries. Clause 1(d) of the Deed of Undertakings reads:

Recital (A) of the Deed of Undertakings explains that it is Mr Wong who has the “expertise and resources” in the business, and recital (B) explains that MCH is controlled by Mr Wong.

Placing such a duty on Mr Wong instead of a corresponding obligation on MCH would still be effective. As recital (B) makes clear, the parties to the Deed of Undertakings were well aware that Mr Wong was in full control of MCH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The second argument involves a past position allegedly taken by Mr Wong. In an email sent to Mr Liong on 30 January 2015 (“the 30 January 2015 Email”), one day after the Deed of Undertakings was signed, Mr Wong stated:

</div> Mr Liong was well aware of corporate identity and contracted around it, consciously delineating the different parties in different documents. Thus the loan was made to MCH and then secured with personal guarantees from Mr and Mrs Wong. The obligations contained within the Deed of Undertakings were framed and phrased in terms of obligations personal to Mr Wong. The objective intention of the parties was to have Mr Wong bear personal liability for any breach of the Deed of Undertakings rather than create corporate liability on the part of MCH. This interpretation does not mean that the Deed of Undertakings is commercially unworkable or ineffective. It is Mr Soh’s own case that Mr Wong is in effective control of MCH, and as such, placing obligations on Mr Wong would be sufficient to ensure that MCH would act in a certain manner. Indeed the Deed of Undertaking was itself a device to compel Mr Wong’s action, as a complement to the Shareholders Agreement, Subscription Agreement and Call Option Agreement signed by the relevant corporate parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 YGL’s third argument is that this is an appropriate case to lift the corporate veil and engage in “outsider reverse piercing”. “Outsider reverse piercing” is a situation where a “third party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a party who is not a shareholder or a corporate insider) invites the court to disregard the separate legal personality of the company … to hold the company liable for the shareholder’s obligations” (see <span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra and others v Salgaocar Anil Vassudeva and others </span>[2018] SGHC 24 at [47]–[48]).

In breach of his obligations, the shareholder-defendant sold and transferred the land to a company under his control. This company was acquired by the shareholder-defendant after the entry of the contract for sale with the plaintiff, and it was not disputed that the sale and transfer of the company was carried through “solely for the purpose of defeating the plaintiff’s rights to specific performance and in order to leave them to claim such damages, if any, as they might establish” (see <span class="font-italic">Jones </span>at 834–835). In deciding whether the court could lift the corporate veil and order that the company specifically perform the contract between the shareholder-defendant and the plaintiff, Russell J held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The defendant company is the creature of the first defendant, a device and a sham, a mask which he holds before his face in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equity. … an equitable remedy is rightly to be granted directly against the creature in such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Jones</span>, MCH was not used as a device, sham or facade by Mr Wong to deliberately evade his contractual obligations to YGG and YGL. Mr Wong’s argument is not that he had procured the cooperation of the relevant individuals but MCH somehow prevented the individuals from being hired. His defence is that there was no need to procure their participation until YGG had full control of the Target Companies. Mr Wong has not used MCH to evade his personal contractual obligations.

While I have found that Mr Wong is in breach of the Deed of Undertakings, with the effluxion of time and the filing of Suits 337 and 80, this primary purpose has largely been overtaken by events. As such, it is no longer appropriate to grant YGL’s prayer for specific performance of the Deed of Undertakings. Neither is the alternative prayer for common law damages arising out of the breach of the Deed of Undertakings apposite save for the two heads of claim elaborated upon in the next paragraph.

</div> It stands to reason that since MCH had no other sources of revenue, and had little or no realisable assets, any law suit would materially affect MCH in financial terms. Mr Wijaya raises two points in reply to Mr Soh’s argument that the commencement of Suit 104 was an Event of Default:

In my view, his proposed interpretation cannot be sustained. There is nothing on the text of clause 12.1(e) that suggests that only legal proceedings commenced by third parties would engage the clause. The phrase “any legal proceedings … of any kind whatsoever” suggests the opposite effect was intended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Mr Wijaya submits that a “purposive reading” of clause 12.1(e) would achieve the desired effect.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, in order for the court to interpret clause 12.1(e) in the manner suggested by Mr Wijaya, there would have to be some evidential basis to show that the parties intended that the clause would be limited to legal proceedings commenced by third parties. In this regard, no evidence, whether within the text of the Loan Agreement or in the extraneous material surrounding the Loan Agreement, has been highlighted to suggest that the parties objectively intended for clause 12.1(e) to be limited in the manner contended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 This does not mean YGL has unlimited latitude to bring any action, however unreasonable, against MCH in order to trigger clause 12.1(e). Clause 12.1(e) expressly limits the applicable legal proceedings to those which in the <span class="font-italic">reasonable opinion</span> of YGL have a material financial effect. Insofar as Suit 104 was brought without a reasonable basis, or <span class="font-italic">mala fide</span>, as Mr Wijaya suggests, clause 12.1(e) would not apply. This leads into Mr Wijaya’s second argument, to which I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Suit 104 was initiated mala fide</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In support of his contention that Suit 104 was initiated <span class="font-italic">mala fide</span>, to seek an early repayment of the loan from YGL, Mr Wijaya relies solely on the fact that Mr Liong was “completely aware of MCH’s financial state” as a company with “little or no realisable assets”. Mr Wijaya suggests that to consider Suit 104 as having a material financial effect on MCH would have the effect of “affording protection to an individual who had entered into a contractual state of affairs willingly, and seeks now to benefit from the same contractual relationship which was clearly slanted in his favour”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 There is no dispute that Mr Liong knew of MCH’s financial position prior to the execution of the Loan Agreement. This fact alone, however, is insufficient to impute improper motives onto Mr Liong and YGL. An examination of the sequence of events leading up the commencement of Suit 104 shows a reasonable basis for its filing, In particular:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Suit 104 was commenced on 3 February 2016. This was more than five months after Mr Wong’s duty to second the core management team within a reasonable time was triggered due to the signing of the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) From Mr Wong’s first presentation, he premised the success of the Target Companies upon the injection of the core management team.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) During this five-month period, Mr Wong repeatedly indicated that he did not intend to procure MCH to hire the core management team and second the same to YGG (see [26]–[30] above). Mr Liong thus had legitimate concerns that Mr Wong would not comply with his obligations under the Deed of Undertakings. These concerns required close attention, given that the secondment of the core management team was a critical part of the business strategy that the parties had formulated at the start of their business relationship (see [4] above). The primary remedy sought was a request for specific performance of the Deed of Undertakings, which suggests that the purpose of Suit 104 was to compel Mr Wong to second the team.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Seen in light of these facts, Suit 104 was not commenced for the purpose of triggering an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement. Instead it was a legitimate attempt to enforce the obligations under the Deed of Undertakings, in the light of Mr Liong’s well-founded fear that Mr Wong would not hire and second the core management team. YGL’s opinion that Suit 104 had a material financial effect on MCH was therefore a reasonable one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I should explain why I decide thus even though I have held that MCH was not a party to the Deed of Undertakings, and YGL was thus not successful in the litigation they instituted against MCH. Clause 12.1(e) did not limit “any legal proceedings” to those which were ultimately successful, only those which “in the reasonable opinion” of YGL would have a material financial effect. The contention that MCH was party to the Deed of Undertaking was not an implausible one and the institution of proceedings against MCH was a reasonable decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of the Deed of Share Charge: Event of Default 3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The Deed of Share Charge is one of the Transaction Documents.

The restrictions that Mr Wong requested for Mr Liong to place on the exercise of clause 3.8 mirror the restrictions Mr Wijaya now says is placed by virtue of the representations made in the 28 January 2015 Email. Yet, instead of agreeing to this request, Mr Liong replied in the 28 January 2015 Email as follows:

If Mr Liong intended to inform Mr Wong that he was willing to restrict his use of clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge in the manner requested, he could simply have amended clause 3.8 as Mr Wong requested. Instead, the clause was not amended. This sequence of events suggests that it is far from clear and unequivocal that Mr Liong was suggesting that he would only exercise the voting rights on the occurrence of an Event of Default.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Nevertheless, Mr Liong did reassure Mr Wong that he would not “interfere” and suggested that the voting rights was meant to make him feel “good and comfortable” with the loan. The question is thus the proper interpretation to take with regards to the scope of this reassurance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The object of clause 3.8 is important in considering its scope. The loan was to provide MCH with enough capital to subscribe to shares in YGG, in order finance YGG’s acquisition of YGIPL (see [6(d)] and [0] above). Mr Liong was investing a substantial sum of money into the joint venture, both directly as a shareholder of YGG as well as indirectly as a creditor to MCH. Mr Liong provided all the cash in the initial purchase of the 40% of YGIPL shares. Seen in this light, clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge was intended to give Mr Liong additional protection for his investment, in allowing him to take control of YGG, to mitigate the risk he bore if Mr Wong or MCH should act against YGG’s interests. Bearing in mind this purpose, as well as the negotiations by the parties over the possibility of amending clause 3.8, I find that the 28 January 2015 Email was a statement from Mr Liong that YGL would only exercise clause 3.8 if it was reasonable to protect YGG’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116  In my view, it was reasonable for Mr Liong to exercise clause 3.8 in the circumstances. Mr Liong knew, as early as 24 February 2015, that Mr Wong had some difficulty getting funds, which was the reason MCH was unable to provide security to proceed with the Initial Acquisition Model.

</div> By March 2016, more than six months after the SPA was signed, Mr Wong had repeatedly refused to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option and had refused to hire and second the core management team to YGG (see [30]–[34]). It was also clear that by this point, the parties’ relationship was rapidly deteriorating. For reasons that had yet to be fully revealed to Mr Liong, Mr Wong appeared to be attempting to stymie the full acquisition of YGIPL. There was a genuine possibility that Mr Wong was deliberately dragging his feet on the acquisition, either due to a lack of funds for MCH to subscribe to the second tranche of shares in YGG, or simply because Mr Wong was unhappy with Mr Liong. This delay resulted in a situation where YGG had no physical presence in the Target Companies, despite the impending deadline for the complete acquisition of YGIPL. Another legitimate fear was that the Vendors would soon be able to purchase the 40% of YGIPL from YGG at a 10% discount, resulting in loss to YGG. In light of these facts, it was reasonable for Mr Liong to fear that without an intervention, Mr Wong and MCH would undermine YGG’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Hence, even if there was promise which formed the basis for a promissory estoppel or formed part of the terms of a collateral contract, Mr Liong acted within the scope of the promise and YGL was entitled to exercise clause 3.8 on 18 March 2018. MCH’s refusal to recognise this exercise was an Event of Default. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breaches of the Shareholders’ Agreement: Events of Default 4-7 </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Holding an EGM on 29 March 2016 without the requisite quorum: Event of Default 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Mr Soh submits that MCH was in breach of clause 6.2.1 of the Shareholders’ Agreement by holding a reconvened EGM on 29 March 2016 (see [36] above) without the requisite quorum.

In the circumstances, Mr Wijaya’s factual premise, that the amendments would grant Mr Liong a significant degree of control in YGG is incorrect. This is because the Shareholders’ Agreement had already bound MCH and YGL, and any amendments in the Articles of Association would only reflect the control Mr Liong already exercised by virtue of the Shareholders’ Agreement. Additionally, it did not appear to be necessarily inconsistent for Mr Wong to be the “captain of the ship” in the sense that Mr Wong would be in charge of the day to day running of the company, and Mr Liong to retain control of the company in the event that Mr Wong began acting against YGG’s interest.

</div> Mr Wijaya’s defence is that YGL is estopped from relying on its legal rights under clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge, for the same reasons raised at [106]–[109] above, and therefore, Mr Tan could not vote on behalf of MCH, and the appointment of Mr Tan as director, which MCH voted in favour of, could not stand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I accept Mr Soh’s submission and reject Mr Wijaya’s defence for two reasons. First, Mr Wijaya’s argument is strictly speaking irrelevant because according to clause 5.8 of the Amended Shareholders’ Agreement, up until the point YGG purchases the remaining 60% of the YGIPL shares, YGL’s vote must be adopted by the board of YGG. Thus, even if MCH had voted against the YGG board resolution appointing Mr Tan as director, by virtue of clause 5.8, Mr Wong was still obliged to accept the appointment of Mr Tan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Second, given my finding that YGL was entitled to exercise clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge on 18 March 2018 and validly appointed Mr Tan as the proxy for MCH (see [117] above), the argument that there was no effective quorum because Mr Wong did not participate in the vote for the appointment of Mr Tan as director also cannot be sustained. Hence, I agree with Mr Soh that there was a breach of the Amended Shareholders’ Agreement, and Event of Default 6 has been made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Divulging confidential information pertaining to YGG to Mr Iskandar after his removal as director: Event of Default 7</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Mr Soh argues that MCH breached clause 12 of the Subscription Agreement, because Mr Wong continued to send confidential information relating to YGG to Mr Iskandar, after Mr Iskandar’s removal as director (see [39] above). As the Subscription Agreement was a “Transaction Document” as defined in the Loan Agreement, this was an Event of Default under clause 12.1(a) of the Amended Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 There is no dispute that if Mr Iskandar was validly removed, there would be a breach of clause 12 of the Subscription Agreement, which prevents shareholders of YGG from divulging confidential information to third parties. Mr Wijaya’s sole point of contention rests on the issue of whether Mr Iskandar was validly removed. He argues that Mr Iskandar was not validly removed as clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge was invalidly exercised by YGL. Given my finding that YGL properly exercised clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge (see [117] above), it follows that Mr Iskandar was validly removed, and Event of Default 7 has been made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure to pay interest under the Loan Agreement: Event of Default 8</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Mr Soh submits that that MCH’s refusal to pay interest from 28 July 2016 onwards (see [42] above) was a breach of the Loan Agreement, and thus constituted an Event of Default under Clause 12.1(a) of the Amended Loan Agreement.

</div> There is no basis for this argument. As established at [101]–[103] above, Suit 104 was not filed in bad faith. Even if Mr Wijaya’s case were taken at its highest and assuming that there was bad faith in the filing of Suit 104, Mr Wijaya did not point to any legal principle that would entitle MCH to cease payment of interest under the loan. I note that in his opening statement, Mr Wijaya initially indicated an intention to pursue an argument on the repudiatory breach of the Loan Agreement. Mr Wijaya confirmed during the oral closing arguments that he was no longer taking up this point.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The elements of the tort of conspiracy are not in dispute and can be briefly stated as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2015] 2 SLR 686 at [150]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A combination of two or more persons and an agreement between and amongst them to do certain acts.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of the conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If it is proven that the conspiracy involves unlawful means, then a predominant intention to cause damage or injury is not required; an intention to cause harm to the plaintiff should suffice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The acts must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Damage must be suffered by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Turning first to the allegation of unlawful means conspiracy on the part of YGL and Mr Liong, I find that all the acts complained of were lawful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 While YGL was not entirely successful in Suit 104, in that they have failed to establish that MCH was a party to the Deed of Undertakings (see [89] above), this does not mean that the commencement of Suit 104 and Suit 337 was unlawful. The YGL parties were perfectly entitled to commence legal action, and a partial failure of such action thus not thereby render a lawfully commenced suit unlawful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Mr Liong and YGL’s act of taking over board control was also lawful. I have found that YGL was fully entitled to exercise clause 3.8 of the Deed of Share Charge and appoint Mr Tan as proxy for MCH (see [117] above). Hence, there is no basis to suggest that any of the action taken pursuant to votes cast by Mr Tan as proxy for MCH, including the removal of Mr Iskandar, and later, the revocation of Mr Wong’s appointment as Managing Director, was unlawful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Turning to consider the allegation of lawful means conspiracy, I find that there was no predominant intention to injure MCH, Mr Wong or Mrs Wong. Where self-interest is the predominant motivation behind the relevant actions, this necessarily suggests that there is no predominant intention to injure (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [96]). In the present case, the sequence of events that led to all the acts complained of by Mr Wong clearly indicate that YGL and Mr Liong were pursuing their self-interest and the interests of YGG in commencing the suits and usurping board control, rather than possessing a predominant intention to injure the MCH parties. To reiterate, Mr Liong was anxious to ensure that Mr Wong would second the core management team to YGG and exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option after their arguments over the KV Asia Offer (see [26] above). Mr Liong was plainly of the view that it was in the best interest of YGG and YGL to complete the acquisition of YGIPL in a smooth and expedient manner. Mr Wong on the other hand, appeared to be delaying the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option and the secondment of the core management team. Seen in this light, the impugned actions can be viewed as a series of escalating responses to Mr Wong’s attempts to thwart the complete acquisition of YGIPL (see [28]–[35] above). I thus find that YGL and Mr Liong were acting predominantly to further their interests and the interests of YGG by ensuring that YGG completely acquired YGIPL as planned. In the circumstances, the tort of conspiracy is not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Before leaving this issue, I highlight a final argument made by Mr Wijaya in closing submissions. He suggests that Mr Liong acted in breach of the Articles of Association of YGG by diverting the dividends due to YGG into his own private bank account without authorisation from the YGG Board, and this forms the basis of a conspiracy claim.

</div>
</div> I do not accept this argument for four reasons. First, I note that this argument was not pleaded. Second, the article relied on by Mr Wijaya, Article 112, pertains to when the dividends of YGG may be declared, it does not prescribe a particular manner in which dividends received from other companies may be held.

</div>
</div> Article 112 thus has no bearing on the fact that Mr Liong is holding these dividends in his own bank account. Third, I accept Mr Liong’s evidence that the reason for this arrangement was simply because YGG had difficulties opening a bank account in China, and Mr Liong was merely using his personal bank account in China to hold the dividend monies on trust for YGG.

</div> There is hence nothing unlawful about his actions. Fourth, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Liong entered into this arrangement with any intention to harm Mr Wong at all, let alone a predominant intention to harm Mr Wong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I therefore dismiss the counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judgment in Suit 337</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The claim in Suit 337 is successful and the counterclaim is dismissed. The Amended Loan Agreement prescribes the consequences for the occurrence of an Event of Default. First, pursuant to clause 12.2(a), all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement, including accrued interest, shall become immediately due and payable. The parties do not dispute that the loan has matured and the principle sum of $450,000 is hence payable in any event. Any unpaid accrued interest on the loan (see [42] above), is also due and payable. In addition, pursuant to clause 6 of the Loan Agreement, default interest on any overdue amounts in the loan agreement is also due and payable. Second, Clause 8A of the Amended Loan Agreement prescribes a mandatory pre-payment fee if an Event of Default occurs. This mandatory pre-payment fee is also due and payable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In the statement of claim for Suit 337, YGL claims a total sum of S$4,568,631.94 as at 6 April 2016 (the date of filing of Suit 337), comprising:

Before considering the winding up of YGG, however, it is important to have the full context. I therefore turn next to the purported breaches of directors’ duties by Mr Wong alleged by YGG in Suit 80. These acts explain the context of Mr Liong’s intervention in YGG. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Wong’s directors’ duties owed to YGG</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In Suit 80, YGG, now under the direction of Mr Liong, sues Mr Wong for breach of his directors’ duties. The facts as found in this suit must be considered together with Suit 107, which is an action to wind up YGG.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview of breaches alleged</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It is common ground that Mr Wong owed fiduciary duties to YGG. In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie</span> [2016] 3 SLR 845 at [136], the Court of Appeal explained a fiduciary’s core duty of loyalty by citing the following passage from the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Bristol &amp; West Building Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular manner or circumstance which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to indicate the nature of fiduciary obligations. They are the defining characteristics of the fiduciary. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Arising, therefore, from their core obligation of loyalty to the company, directors owe various fiduciary duties, including the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interest of the company, the duty not to place oneself in a position of conflict and the duty not to profit from one’s position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interest of the company was considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd)</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span>”). I summarise the applicable principles gleaned from the case as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court will be slow to interfere with commercial decisions of directors which have been made honestly even if they turn out, on hindsight, to be financially detrimental (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [37]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This does not mean that the court refrains entirely from exercising supervision over directors as long as they claim to be acting to promote the companies’ interests. Where a transaction is not objectively in the company’s interest, a judge may very well draw an inference that the directors were not acting honestly (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [38]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The requirement of <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> will not be satisfied if the director acted dishonestly (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The duty not to place oneself in a position of conflict, also known as the no-conflict rule, mandates that a fiduciary may not place himself in a position or enter into a transaction in which his personal interest may conflict with his duty to his principal, unless his principal, with full knowledge of all the material circumstances and of the nature and extent of the fiduciary’s interests, consents. This duty is targeted at potential as well as actual conflict. The law only requires that there is a reasonable perception of a conflict of interest arising (see <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 at [137]–[138]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The duty not to profit from one’s position, also known as the no-profit rule, can be seen as a particular application of the no-conflict rule. A fiduciary is duty bound to refrain from retaining any profit which he has made through the use of the company’s property, information or opportunities to which he has access by virtue of being a director, unless he has the fully informed consent of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 592 at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Mr Lobo also relied upon the statutory duty owed under s 157(1) of the Companies Act, that mandates that a director “shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office”. This statutory duty encapsulates two sets of duties. The first, the duty to act honestly, is the statutory equivalent of the fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Kang Peng</span> at [35]). The second, the duty to use reasonable diligence, captures a director’s separate common law duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [134]). The duty of care, skill and diligence is not a fiduciary duty because it is not imposed to exact loyalty from a director (see <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong </span>at [135]). The standard of care and diligence expected of a director is not fixed and is a continuum depending on various factors such as the individual’s role in the company, the type of decision being made, and the size and the business of the company. The standard will not be lowered to accommodate any inadequacies in the individual’s knowledge or experience and will instead be raised if the director holds himself out to possess or does in fact possess some special knowledge or experience (see <span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship Pte Ltd v Lim Say Wan </span>[2017] 3 SLR 839 at [43]–[44], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong</span> at [136]). Both duties are in play when considering Mr Wong’s conduct. If the higher threshold of fiduciary duties is made out, a different range of remedies arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The six breaches alleged are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Wong’s failure to disclose the Secret Arrangements;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Wong’s failure to disclose that MCH had no money to subscribe for the second tranche of shares in YGG;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Wong’s failure to ensure that YGG utilised the management rights given by the SPA; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Wong’s failure to second Mr Seen, Mr Lou and Ms Chng to YGG; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Mr Wong’s delay in exercising the Purchaser’s Call Option; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Mr Wong’s failure to disclose the YKL Offer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings on breaches alleged</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The first allegation concerns that of secret profits. The last is of non-disclosure in the face of a conflict of interest. Contentions (b) to (e) concern decisions made by Mr Wong after the SPA was signed. It is contended that he did not make these decisions honestly. For the reasons below, I find that all six separate instances of breach are made out and reflect breaches of fiduciary duties. While at the same time Mr Wong may have additionally breached statutory or common law duties, this does not add further reliefs in this case where there are concomitant breaches of fiduciary duties. I focus below primarily on the breaches of fiduciary duty, and thereafter, on the remedies applicable for those breaches.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failing to disclose the Secret Arrangements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 It is not disputed that the Secret Arrangements were not disclosed to Mr Liong. Mr Wijaya argues that the Secret Commission Agreement and the Secret Trust Deeds were not arrangements which resulted in profit to either MCH or himself. Mr Wong’s case is that the Secret Arrangements were in substance an agreement for Mr Wong to sell the shares in MCH to Mr Lim and Ms Mao for the sum of US$380,000. Mr Wong suggests that he had made no profit at all in these Secret Arrangements, because the MCH shares were “sold” at an undervalue “in order to facilitate the deal to help push the acquisition [of YGIPL] through”.

First, Mr Wong’s evidence constantly shifted throughout trial, and I did not find him to be credible on this point. In contrast, Mr Lim and Mr Koh Chaik Ming were consistent on the nature of the Secret Arrangements. Second, on 4 August 2015, Mr Wong appeared to have inadvertently sent a draft of the Secret Commission Agreement letter to Mr Liong, and pretended that he would not be accepting any commission from the Vendors (see [16] above). If Mr Wong believed that the Secret Arrangements actually involved a sale done in the interests of the YGG, it is difficult to understand why Mr Wong would lie and hide the arrangement from Mr Liong. Mr Wong himself stated that he “would not be accepting this [referring to the draft Commission Letter] because this is in <span class="font-italic">conflict of interest</span>” [emphasis added]. Third, Mr Lim and Mr Koh’s characterisation of the Secret Arrangements match more closely with the text of the documentation on these arrangements. The Commission Letter states:

There is also nothing on the face of the Commission Letter and the Secret Trust Deeds to suggest that the Secret Arrangements involved a sale of MCH shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Therefore, I find that Mr Wong made a secret profit through the Secret Commission Agreement, and this profit was obtained by way of opportunities that came about by virtue of Mr Wong’s position as a director of YGG.

This clearly created a potential conflict between the interest of YGG and Mr Wong’s obligations under the trust deeds to follow the instructions of Ms Mao and Mr Lim.

Indeed, it would not be inaccurate to suggest that Mr Wong jealously guarded this responsibility, and voiced his displeasure whenever Mr Liong tried to undertake a greater degree of involvement in managing YGG. Three examples illustrate this point:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief, Mr Wong highlighted that he had always been the contact person for the deal with the Vendors, and claims that he was “usurped” from his role in the company, YGG, that he had “so painstakingly developed”.

</div> Mr Wong thus made clear to Mr Liong that, consistent with their understanding at the beginning of their business relationship, he would be the one making the final decision on the timing of the full acquisition of the Target Companies. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Mr Liong gave evidence that Mr Wong insisted that he would be the only point of contact in dealing with the shareholders of the Target Companies and did not allow Mr Liong to engage the Vendors.

</div> This is corroborated by a WhatsApp message sent on 9 September 2015 where Mr Wong chided Mr Liong for approaching one of the Vendors for his contact details during a meeting with the Vendors, telling Mr Liong that “[t]his is also very wrong and something we cannot do … Just to let you know that it will always be better to ask as you are not familiar with rules in M&amp;A”.

</div> it was plain that it was in YGG’s best interest to have capitalised on these rights as soon as possible in order to give YGG a measure of control and oversight over YGIPL and facilitate the eventual takeover of YGIPL.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 7.3 of the SPA mandates that if the aggregate net profit after tax (“NPAT”) earned by the Target Companies exceeds that of the previous year, dividends would have to be declared based on 50% of the NPAT for the period from 19 August 2015 to 31 December 2015, or to the date of exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, whichever is earlier.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 7.4 of the SPA mandates that if similar conditions are met for the year 2016, dividends would have to be declared based on 50% of the NPAT for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, or to the date of exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, whichever is earlier. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 7.5 of the SPA provides that the distribution of dividends would be based on the parties’ respective shareholdings in YGIPL immediately prior to the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option or the Vendors’ Call Option (as the case may be). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 7.6 mandates that if dividends are declared in accordance with clauses 7.3 and 7.4, YGIPL would pay Ms Mao an incentive amount based on 8% of the NPAT for the period from 19 August 2015 to the date of the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The effect of these provisions was that the later the Purchaser’s Call Option was exercised, the more dividend would be paid to the Vendors, rather than to YGG, and the greater the amount that would be paid to Ms Mao as an incentive. Additionally, if the Purchaser’s Call Option were to lapse on 19 August 2016, the Vendors would have the option of purchasing 40% of YGIPL back from YGG at a 10% discount (see [19(c)] above). It was thus in YGG’s best interest to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option as soon as possible, despite the outer limit of the August date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Hence, it is clear that Mr Wong’s decisions in failing to capitalise on the SPA Benefits, failing to second the core management team and delaying the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option were not in YGG’s best interest. However, the fact that the decisions were detrimental to YGG’s interest alone is insufficient to support a finding that Mr Wong was not acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of YGG (see [152(a)] above). The critical question is whether Mr Wong acted honestly and in good faith in making these decisions. For the reasons that follow, I find that Mr Wong did not meet this standard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Wong’s lack of honesty and good faith </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Mr Wong’s awareness on the urgency in the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The circumstances demonstrate that Mr Wong knew it would be in the best interest of YGG to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option as soon as possible. Mr Wong, on behalf of YGG, had led a fairly extensive examination of the Target Companies prior to the signing of the SPA. This included the commissioning of a legal due diligence, meetings with the Vendors, as well as a site visit (see [14] above). This was the logical course to take because once the SPA was signed, YGG would be locked into an arrangement where they had to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option within a year, or risk allowing the Vendors to purchase back the 40% of YGIPL shares at a 10% discount. Mr Wong was clearly cognizant of this risk. In an email date 3 March 2015 sent to Mr Lim, Mr Wong stated:

</div>
</div> I would add that as the primary point of contact for YGG in the negotiation process with the Vendors, and an individual who had taken an active part in the structuring of the SPA (see [12] above), it would be extremely unusual for Mr Wong not to have noticed that the SPA was structured precisely to incentivise the early exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option (see [170]–[171] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Thus I find that Mr Wong knew that once YGG entered into the SPA, there was a certain urgency in terms of the timing of the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option and it would be in the best interest for YGG to exercise the option expediently. This agreement in the SPA was not unduly detrimental to YGG because as Mr Wong himself suggested to Mr Lim in the email reproduced above at [173], the sole objective of the deal was to fully acquire YGIPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Following from this, Mr Wong must have known that the SPA Benefits would have to be utilised and the core management team would have to be seconded as soon as possible in order to support the expedient exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Despite this awareness, Mr Wong refused to take action. This alone does not prove Mr Wong was dishonest. He could, for example, have honestly believed that the circumstances had changed so significantly that it was not in the interest of YGG to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option and hence it was also not necessary to capitalise on the SPA Benefits or second the core management team. However, an examination of the actual reasons given by Mr Wong for his actions betray his dishonest intentions in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (2) The reasons given by Mr Wong in relation to the failure to capitalise on the SPA Benefits</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Mr Wong could not come up with a coherent explanation for why he honestly believed it was in the best interest of YGG not to have capitalised on the SPA Benefits. His reasons vacillated wildly at different stages of the proceedings. At the pleadings stage, Mr Wong suggested that the discovery of the outstanding due diligence issues (see [40] above) and the “seizure of control” during the EGM of 22 March 2016 (see [35] above) made it such that he was unable to cause YGG to capitalise on the SPA benefits. However, all the acts in his pleaded case occurred after 3 February 2016, some six months after the execution of the SPA, hence these reasons could not have been the actual reason why Mr Wong refused to capitalise on the SPA Benefits at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 During cross examination, Mr Wong changed tack and suggested that nominating a signatory to YGIPL would be detrimental to YGG because there was a chance that the signatory would accidentally sign off on inaccurate cheques that were deliberately tampered with by the management of YGIPL.

</div> Insofar as the Vendors had an obligation to demonstrate a willingness to provide the SPA benefits, I note that as early as 21 February 2016, Mr Lim had sent an email stating the surprise and disappointment on the part of the Vendors that YGG had yet to nominate persons to capitalise on the SPA benefits, despite 6 months having elapsed since the execution of the SPA (see [74] above).

</div> I have found that the obligations under the Deed of Undertakings arose after the execution of the SPA (see [78] above).

Even then, he was not consistent as to why the Deed of Undertakings did not apply. As such, I do not believe that Mr Wong honestly believed that the Deed of Undertakings was not applicable and Mr Wong’s defence on this point fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The reasons given by Mr Wong for the delay in the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Mr Wong first confirmed that there would be a delay in the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option (to after December 2015) in a series of WhatsApp group conversation messages sent by Mr Wong to Mr Liong, Mr Iskandar and Mr Ang on 19 November 2015:

Once done, we will exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In this exchange, Mr Wong gave several reasons why it was not, in his view, prudent to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option by December 2015. Mr Wong highlighted that the parties’ dispute over the amendment of the SPA in favour of YGL (see [22] above) and the dispute on the due diligence costs (see [23] above) delayed the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. However, these disputes were internal to YGG, and the parties could have simultaneously worked through these matters while pushing for the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, bearing in mind the fact that YGG would have to share a greater amount of the dividends of YGIPL and pay a higher amount of incentive to Ms Mao the longer the exercise took. In any event, it was clear by that point that these disputes had been resolved, and it was in YGG’s interest for Mr Wong to quickly set about the task of exercising the Purchaser’s Call Option.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Instead, Mr Wong provided three other reasons why the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option ought to be further delayed, namely, the need for asset tagging, the need for “full year numbers” and the need to get operational and financial insight into the Target Companies (see [30] above). It is significant to note that none of these reasons were part of Mr Wong’s pleaded case as to why he honestly believed that it was in the best interest of YGG to delay the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. Additionally, these reasons do not hold up to scrutiny.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 When challenged by Mr Liong on the necessity of asset tagging before the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, Mr Wong claimed that asset tagging was required because the “purchase price is also dependent on actual assets”.

</div> It is unclear what Mr Wong meant by this statement. If Mr Wong meant that the purchase price of YGIPL would change based on a valuation of the assets of the company, this was plainly untrue, since the purchase price had already been agreed within the SPA. If Mr Wong was suggesting that it would be prudent to check the total valuation of the assets, in order to protect YGG’s interest, this was an issue that should have been resolved in advance of entry into the SPA. As Mr Wong was well aware, once the SPA was executed, YGG would be suffer greater financial drawbacks the longer they took to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option. In this regard, even prior to the execution of the SPA, Mr Wong was sufficiently reassured after his investigations into the Target Companies and the due diligence conducted by the firms Mr Wong himself had lionised (see [5] above) that the complete acquisition of YGIPL was a good deal for YGG (see [11] and [14] above). I also observe that asset tagging was completed by Mr Ang within the short span of a week (see [29] above), which suggests that asset tagging was not such a serious barrier to the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option as suggested by Mr Wong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In relation to Mr Wong’s suggestion that there was a need to get operational and financial insight into the Target Companies, it was similarly unusual that sufficient operational and financial insight was not already obtained prior to the execution of the SPA through the due diligence exercises and the meetings and site visits conducted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 As to the need for “full year numbers”, this subsequently morphed into a suggestion by Mr Wong that the audited accounts of YGIPL needed to be obtained before the Purchaser’s Call Option could be exercised.

This is clearly mentioned in all my explanations and it is non negotiable as it will mean acceptance and paying out their dividends to the exiting share holders. The lead time between exercising of 40% of the final execution of 60% is too short a time to make a move.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 It is unclear what Mr Wong meant by “M&amp;A norms”. If a lengthy delay in the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option was an “M&amp;A norm”, one would have expected that Mr Wong would not have committed to December 2015 as the date for the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option in May 2015 (see [174] above). Further, there is nothing in the SPA that prevents YGIPL from declaring dividends on the basis of the management accounts of the company, and in fact this was what eventually occurred. Moving to the suggestion that YGG would be short-changed if an audit was not conducted, as the dividends declared would be based on unaudited accounts, this was an inherent feature of the structure of the SPA that had been agreed as between the parties; Either audited accounts were used to declare the dividends, in which case the Purchaser’s Call Option would be delayed and YGL would have to give Ms Mao a greater incentive and share more of the dividends with the Vendors, or the unaudited accounts were used. Yet, Mr Wong as the primary negotiator of the SPA on behalf of YGL did not raise this as a concern until some four months after the SPA was entered into, and even committed to a December 2015 exercise date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 On 16 February 2016, Mr Wong shifted his position and suggested that the Second Due Diligence was necessary before the Purchaser’s Call Option could be exercised, and further, the due diligence had to led by the exact same auditors who led the initial financial due diligence exercise (see [32] above). As is apparent, this was not a requirement that Mr Wong highlighted to Mr Liong at any point during the process leading up to the execution of the SPA, and even up till December 2015, when Mr Liong was pushing Mr Wong to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option. Mr Wong claimed in an email dated 21 March 2016 that the reason he was insisting on the Second Due Diligence was that YGG had a contractual obligation to conduct the due diligence prior to the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option.

</div> Additionally, if Mr Wong honestly believed that the results of a Second Due Diligence were important in clarifying the viability of YGIPL as an acquisition target, Mr Wong’s prior negotiations with Mr Lim would make no sense. In such a scenario, it would run contrary to YGG’s interest to have negotiated, as Mr Wong did, for a clause that YGG would suffer a 10% loss in the event that the Vendors exercised the Vendor’s Call Option. Mr Wong even expressly told the Vendors that he had no issues with such a clause, as he wanted to assure them of YGL’s “sincerity” in the 100% acquisition of YGIPL (see [173] above). Mr Wong also conceded during cross examination that the first set of legal and financial due diligence was “actually pretty satisfactory”.

</div> If Mr Wong was acting honestly in YGG’s interest, it is difficult to understand why he would push for YGG to delay the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option on the basis of a report that merely flagged out problems that were already known to the parties prior to the execution of the SPA, bearing in mind that YGG had entered into the SPA nonetheless. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 As a further demonstration of Mr Wong’s dishonest intentions, I highlight that, in the course of negotiations with YKL on the purchase of YGIPL, Mr Wong suggested to Mr Shortell in an email sent on 15 July 2016 that both the First and Second Due Diligence Reports as well as the Legal Due Diligence Report would be “crucial” to move the deal forward and proposed sending the reports to YKL.

</div> This demonstrates that Mr Wong believed that the due diligence reports reflected positively on YGIPL and would incentivise YKL to purchase YGIPL. This was during the same period where Mr Wong was relying on the very same Second Due Diligence Report as the basis for his claim that it was unwise to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The significance of the omissions and excuses </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Having considered the totality of Mr Wong’s actions highlighted above at [173]–[192], I find that Mr Wong was dishonest. Mr Wong failed to capitalise on the SPA Benefits, failed to embed the core management team with YGIPL and thereby acted contrary to YGG’s best interest. Mr Wong delayed, time and again, the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, knowing it was deleterious to YGG’s interest. Mr Wong drip-fed a series of shifting and illogical excuses for delaying the secondment of the core management team and the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. At the same time, his actions indicate that he had no honest belief in the excuses which he furnished Mr Liong. Finally, he advised Mr Liong not to proceed with the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, knowing that this would occasion immediate loss to YGG, while at the same time trying to sell YGIPL to YKL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Mr Wong’s lack of funds</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Mr Wong’s motivation for his dishonesty was also laid bare at trial. While Mr Wong was delaying the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, he was secretly meeting with representatives from YKL without YGL’s knowledge to structure a deal on the potential acquisition of YGIPL, despite the fact that YGG was concurrently grappling with precisely the same acquisition (see [33]–[40] above). Mr Wong’s dogged attempts in striking a deal, first with KV Asia and later clandestinely with YKL, coupled with the fact that he had to borrow money from Mr Liong to finance MCH’s purchase of YGG’s shares, reveal the reasons behind Mr Wong’s attempts to delay the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option. What is common to the KV Asia Offer and the YKL Offers is that Mr Wong would not need to contribute any additional cash to the venture. On the other hand, upon the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, MCH would be obliged to subscribe to US$4,290,000 worth of YGG shares (see [20] above). Additionally, under the terms of the Deed of Undertakings, Mr Wong was obliged to bear a proportion of the cost of seconding the core management team.

Mr Wong’s own pleaded position is that the alleged conspiracy by the YGL parties caused “difficulty in raising funds” and impacted MCH’s ability to subscribe to the second tranche of YGG shares,

</div> which fortifies the conclusion that Mr Wong was simply unable to locate funds. I therefore find that he lacked capital at the material time to subscribe for the second tranche of shares in YGG in order to enable YGG to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the breaches linked to the decisions of Mr Wong in relation to the acquisition of YGIPL </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I have found that Mr Wong acted dishonestly in failing to capitalise on the SPA Benefits and failing to hire and second the core management team as soon as possible. In relation to the delay in the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, Mr Lobo argues that Mr Wong was in breach of his fiduciary duties as early as at 31 December 2015, even though the Purchaser’s Call Option could be exercised as late as at August 2016. I agree with Mr Lobo on this point. I note that Mr Wong had knowledge that the SPA was structured in a manner to incentivise YGG to exercise the Purchaser’s Call Option expediently (see [175] above). The plan communicated by Mr Wong in May 2015 was for the Purchaser’s Call Option to be exercised in December 2015 (see [174] above). The gist of the information available to Mr Wong did not change from May 2015 (the time he communicated this plan) up to 31 December 2015. Instead of acting honestly and exercising the Purchaser’s Call Option as planned, Mr Wong was dishonest to the YGG board as early as 19 November 2015, by concocting the first of many sham excuses to delay the execution of the Purchaser’s Call Option. In the circumstances, I find that no honest fiduciary acting with Mr Wong’s knowledge would have delayed the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option past 31 December 2015, and Mr Wong was in breach of his fiduciary duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interest of YGG as at 31 December 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 I have found that Mr Wong lacked capital at the material time to subscribe for the second tranche of shares in YGG (see [195] above). Mr Wong was therefore in breach of the no-conflict rule by failing to disclose that MCH had no money to subscribe for the second tranche of shares in YGG. Mr Wong had a personal interest in ensuring that the Purchaser’s Call Option was not exercised, so that MCH would not have to subscribe to the second tranche of shares. Conversely, YGG’s interest was for the Purchaser’s Call Option to be exercised expediently. Mr Wong’s failure to fully disclose this conflict to the YGG Board was a breach of fiduciary duty. His failure to disclose was intentional, and he further omitted to answer Mr Liong’s direct query on the issue. When Mr Liong specifically asked Mr Wong on 1 May 2016 as to whether Mr Wong had the necessary funds, Mr Wong simply ignored the question.

The option was only phrased in tentative terms, and suggested that Mr Wong had yet to find an investor. In truth, Mr Wong had been negotiating with YKL since late February 2016. By July, not only had Mr Wong found an investor, YKL had already made a second offer on 14 July 2016, one day before this letter was sent to YGL (see [40] above). Mr Wong had negotiated this offer in secret and entirely without Mr Liong’s knowledge. Therefore, I find that Mr Wong did not give full disclosure of the YKL offers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 When Mr Wong was cross-examined on the stand, he sought to explain away his omission by saying that he believed that Mr Liong would not accept the Second YKL Offer in any event, because he had earlier turned down the KV Asia Offer:

It is because the consideration of the KV Asia deal was really a benchmark for me because the returns I don’t think Mr Liong would accept. Is because the KV Asia deal was around 10 million for him to exit, whereas this amount for 15.5 is only around 4.5 million above what we actually paid. I don’t think we will agree. That is why I let the deal lapse and I did not go ahead with the deal. So therefore from the YGG perspective itself, so I did not move ahead because probably the option price is probably not within the benchmark that we had for KV Asia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202  This contention is clearly not sustainable. The KV Asia Offer was wholly different from the Second YKL Offer. The KV Asia Offer was premised upon the project going forward into an uncertain future with Mr Liong’s share diluted. The Second YKL Offer gave Mr Liong a clear exit with profit and would have come as a relief to him, since he lacked the core management team’s expertise in operating a cold chain logistics business. It was a deal with clear benefit to YGG, and in the circumstances, Mr Wong was in breach of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interest of YGG.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Concurrent breaches of the duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 It will be clear from the above that Mr Wong has also breached his statutory duty to use reasonable diligence and his common law duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence. The standard of care placed upon him in relation to this duty is also that of an expert in the cold chain logistics industry as well as in corporate mergers and acquisitions.

The second and more recent approach is to use a “but-for” test across all cases of breach of fiduciary duties: see <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> Holding Pte Ltd and another v Sim Poh Ping and others </span>[2018] SGHC 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings</span>”) at [193]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 This difference in approaches to the issue of causation is not material to this case. For the losses claimed at [204(b)] – [204(g)], these losses are directly connected to the misfeasance. The higher threshold of the “but-for” test is clearly made out. For the loss claimed at [204(h)], being the diminution in the value of YGG’s shares in YGIPL, I hold that the existence of the loss itself has not been proved and hence a causation issue does not arise. My reasons follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dividends on the profits made by the Target Companies from January 2016 to June 2016 paid to the Vendors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 I have found that Mr Wong was in breach of his duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interest of YGG in delaying the exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option past 31 December 2015. No honest fiduciary with the information available to Mr Wong would have made that decision (see [196] above). In the circumstances, it is clear that but for Mr Wong’s breach, YGG would have exercised the Purchaser’s Call Option by 31 December 2015 and the relevant dividends would not have been paid out to the Vendors.

This was compounded by Mr Wong’s refusal to grant Mr Liong, Mr Ang and Mr Tan access to the final copy of the First Legal Due Diligence Report.

This can only be a matter of inference to be determined from all the circumstances. The plaintiff’s own evidence that he would have acted to obtain the benefit or avoid the risk, while important, may not be believed by the judge, especially if there is compelling evidence that he would not. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Although the question is a hypothetical one, </span>it is well established that the plaintiff must prove on balance of probability that he would have taken action to obtain the benefit or avoid the risk. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) In many cases the plaintiff’s loss depends on the hypothetical action of a third party, either in addition to action by the plaintiff, as in this case, or independently of it.

In respect of this third proposition, the Court of Appeal set out a two stage test at [139] for cases where a claimant’s loss depended on the actions of a third party, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the breach on the part of the defendant cause the plaintiff to lose a chance to acquire an asset or a benefit?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the chance lost a real or substantial one, not one that was speculative?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Mr Lobo is of the view that satisfaction of the two criteria is sufficient. Mr Wijaya suggests that in order to establish causation, proof on the balance of probabilities that YGG would have acted in a certain way to avail itself of the chance is required, citing <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp and Another </span>[2015] SGHC 213 (“<span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span>”) at [12]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 In <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span>, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J<span class="font-italic"> </span>relied on the Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 (“<span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping</span>”). There the plaintiff sued the defendant-auditors for negligently auditing the accounts, allowing a director to misappropriate a substantial amount. The court took the view that the plaintiff would not have taken the necessary steps to investigate the matter, even if the defendants had not been negligent. After referring to Stuart-Smith LJ’s framework, Chan Sek Keong CJ stated at [148]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> 148 Translated into the context of the present case, the appellant needs to prove on a balance of probabilities that if the respondent had in fact taken adequate steps toward verification of Riggs’ remuneration and/or qualified the audit reports, the appellant in turn would have taken the necessary steps to investigate Riggs’ misappropriation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the unauthorised cheques and forged invoices. While the appellant need not prove the eventual success of the inquiries on a balance of probabilities, it does have to prove that it would in fact have investigated the matter so as to “put it on track to secure the benefit of that chance” …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In my view, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span>, in setting out the two specific questions (see [214] above), was directing its mind to the specific issue of the third of Stuart-Smith LJ’s three propositions: responsibility for the loss of chance, <span class="font-italic">where </span><span class="font-italic">such loss of chance was dependent on the third party</span>. The court was not focused on the claimant’s actions but implicit in the Court of Appeal’s reasoning was that the claimant’s likely action was proved on the balance of probabilities. Chao JA stated at [141]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At no time did the appellant abandon its decision to acquire the stake. Business or bargaining strategy must not be confused with a lack of interest. Neither should Murray’s attempt to drive a hard bargain with Starwood with regard to the “key money” be viewed in any other light. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 In these third category cases, the claimant’s act bears no relation to the loss of the chance. This category was the focal point in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span>. The claimant need only show on the balance of probabilities that <span class="font-italic">he would have availed himself</span> of the chance if it had arisen.

Mr Wong’s breach of duty in failing to give full disclosure of the YKL Offers caused YGG to lose a chance to pursue a deal with YKL. Although the claim is for equitable compensation, this causal link is established even on the stricter “but for” test of causation. None of the YGL parties had knowledge of the YKL offers until Mr Liong coincidentally met Mr Ken Koh around May 2017.

</div> The non-disclosure of the YKL offers therefore meant that YGG was denied the chance to pursue a deal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 As to requirement (b), I find that YGG can prove on the balance of probabilities that but for Mr Wong’s breach, YGG would have availed itself the opportunity to negotiate with YKL. Four reasons are relevant. First, at the point of the First YKL Offer in June 2016, the spectre of the exercise of the Vendor’s Call Option was rapidly approaching, and correspondingly, the possibility of being compelled to sell the 40% stake in YGIPL at a loss. Second, it was clear by that point that Mr Wong and Mr Liong’s relationship had deteriorated significantly, and the core management team was unlikely to play a part in the management of YGG. Third, both the First and Second YKL Offers represented a substantial profit from the total cost YGG would have spent to acquire YGIPL under the SPA. Fourth, YGL clearly had the financial means and desire to fund YGG’s exercise of the Purchaser’s Call Option, as was in fact done on 18 August 2016. In the circumstances, it was clearly advantageous for YGG to have struck an exit deal with YKL, taken the profit and be relieved of the burden of running the Target Companies without the expertise of the promised core management team. Stuart Smith LJ in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Allied Maples </span>at 1610E has taken the view, that “where the action required of the plaintiff is clearly for his benefit, the court has little difficulty in concluding that he would have taken it.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 Regarding requirement (c), it was clear that the chance to enter an agreement with YKL was a real and substantial chance. Mr Ken Koh gave unchallenged evidence that he was highly interested in the acquisition. Mr Ken Koh explained that he was interested in acquiring the Target Companies due to economies of scale.

His position was that at the relevant time, if due diligence was successful and the conditions he imposed on the deal were met, the chance of YKL entering into a deal for the purchase of YGIPL was 80% to 90%.

In making this finding, I recognise several points that suggest the chance of achieving a deal was not as high or optimistic as Mr Ken Koh suggested:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Lim gave evidence that he did not view Mr Ken Koh’s offers as serious offers, as the offers appeared to be an unsolicited and involved very little face-to-face negotiation.

</div> The structure and timing of the purchase would have required further negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In my view, these factors do not render the chance speculative, and are matters to be considered in the context of assessment of the applicable award for the loss of chance. In <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span>, for example, the appellant wished to invest in the management of a hotel, the Grand Pacific Hotel, which was owned by a company called PSD and was negotiating with PSD’s majority shareholder. A minority shareholder held a right of first refusal in respect of shares in PSD. The appellant and the first respondent entered into an agreement to operate the Grand Pacific Hotel, and also signed a non-circumvention agreement. Subsequently, in breach of the non-circumvention agreement, the first respondent contracted with the Narula family in its bid to purchase the majority stake in PSD. Holding the first respondent liable for the appellant’s loss of chance, the Court of Appeal took note of various other contingencies at [130]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The appellant would have to find a banker who would offer loans on terms which it and [the minority shareholder] could accept. The appellant and [the minority shareholder] would also have to agree on the question of control of PSD because taking over the Lai Sun stake would give the appellant a majority shareholding in PSD. Furthermore, the appellant would have to finalise the management contract with [the first respondent], including the question of the renovation loan. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 The majority of the Court of Appeal, being of the view that these contingencies did not render the chance speculative, stated, at [133] and [136], that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the third party would have acted in such a manner as to confer the plaintiff the benefit in question; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was not necessary for such a plaintiff to show on a balance of probabilities that the chance would have come to fruition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Turning, then, to the issue of the assessment of the loss of chance, Mr Lobo submits that the appropriate method of calculation is to multiply the probability of the event occurring by the value of the lost chance to ascertain the value of the loss. I note that this approach was approved in the context of a breach of fiduciary duty in <span class="font-italic">QAM</span> at [79], [80] and [86]. The value of the lost chance could be calculated by reference to the profit YGG would have made if it had managed to sell 100% of YGIPL to YKL for the price of the Second YKL Offer. This profit amounts to US$4.5m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 The probability of the event occurring in this case would correspond to the likelihood that YKL and YGG would have successfully negotiated a deal for the price of the Second YKL Offer. For example, Lai Siu Chiu J in the assessment decision for <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel</span> (reported as <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd and Another </span>[2007] SGHC 50) gave 34% to the probability of securing the Grand Pacific Hotel by assessing, weighting, and then adding the chances of the plaintiff obtaining financing, minority shareholder concurrence and securing the final management agreement. Mr Lobo submits that the probability of the event occurring should be 90% in light of Mr Ken Koh’s evidence (see [222] above). I find that a proper assessment of the probability ought to take into account the matters highlighted at [223] above. In particular, negotiations were at an extremely early stage. The profit margin would likely have whittled down first, on a discovery of the disagreement between shareholders, and second, in negotiations over the continued participation of Ms Mao and the rest of the incumbent management team. I set the probability of the event at 12.5%. In addition, the value of the loss should not be set at the full US$4.5m, because there would have been miscellaneous expenses saved or spent. Those details are not in the evidence. Nevertheless, the exercise of assessment in loss of chance cases, in view of the various contingencies that would require estimates, must be one where absolute precision is not possible. As Vaughn William LJ highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Chaplin v Hicks</span> [1911] 2 KB 786 at 791, “certainty is impossible of attainment”. Rather than to send the profit margin to an assessment before a registrar, I am of the view that it is more practicable to set a conservative sum in the round. Therefore, using a base estimate of US$4m (instead of US$4.5m) and a percentage of 12.5%, I award US$500,000 for the loss of chance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Diminution in the value of YGG’s shares in YGIPL </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 The final head of claim is that of diminution in the value of YGG’s shares in YGIPL. It is argued that as a result of Mr Wong’s breach of duty in failing to hire and second the core management team to YGG, there was a diminution in the value of the shares of the Target Companies held by YGIPL, which in turn caused a corresponding diminution in the value of the YGIPL shares held by YGG.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 As a preliminary matter, I should deal with the reflective loss issue relevant to this head of claim. The principle of reflective loss dictates that a claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made good if the company’s assets were replenished through action against the party responsible for the loss (see<span class="font-italic"> Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</span><span class="font-italic"> (a firm) </span>[2002] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”) at 35). In the present case, the primary loss occasioned in this case is the loss of profit to the Target Companies, and the diminution in value of the YGG shares is reflective of the loss which would be made good if the Target Companies’ assets were replenished through an action taken by the Target Companies against Mr Wong. This does not pose issues for YGG in this case because the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span><span class="font-italic"> Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span>”) at [79] has held that if there is no risk of double recovery and no prejudice to the creditors or shareholders of the company, the policy reasons behind the decision in <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>do not apply. The Court of Appeal further noted at [87] that it may be highly prejudicial and unjust to allow a defendant who has failed to plead the principle of reflective loss as a defence to subsequently rely on the same principle to escape liability. In the present case, Mr Wong has not pleaded reflective loss as a defence although Mr Wijaya has referred to it in his submissions. Even if Mr Wong had done so, it is reasonable to assume that YGG would have been able to procure YGIPL and the Target Companies to give an undertaking not to bring an action against Mr Wong in respect of this claim, given that the Target Companies are wholly owned by YGIPL, which is in turn wholly owned by YGG. Thus, the reflective loss principal is not engaged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 Nevertheless, I find that this head of claim has not been made out. In the context of common law damages, it is well-established that a claimant must prove the fact of loss. A claimant who cannot prove that damage has been suffered cannot mount a claim in respect of the alleged loss. On the other hand, the fact that the amount of the loss cannot be assessed with certainty is not a bar to a claim (see James Edelman, McGregor on Damages (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2018) at pp 315–316). Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Sabyasachi</span><span class="font-italic"> Mukherjee and another v Pradeepto Kumar Biswas and another suit </span>[2018] SGHC 271 (“<span class="font-italic">Mukherjee</span>”) at [52] applied the same requirement of proof of loss to a claim in equitable compensation. I agree with the approach in <span class="font-italic">Mukherjee</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 It is important to note that the Target Companies continue to be profitable. On the stand, Mr Ang testified that there was a drop in the net profits of the Target Companies when comparing between 2015 to 2016, from US$1.65m to US$1.1m.

</div> No further evidence was led on the specifics of the decrease in net profit, nor was the court referred to the relevant financial accounts which would illustrate the factors that led to the decrease. The mere fact that a company makes less net profit compared to the previous year is, without more, insufficient in itself to prove the loss suffered by the company. Particulars of the alleged loss, such as accounts to illustrate the reasons for the fall in net profits, would be required to substantiate that the company has suffered damage, and the nature of the damage suffered. The vague estimates of the net profit given by Mr Ang and Mr Liong are far from sufficient. In oral submissions, Mr Lobo suggested that this could be put to an assessment before a registrar. This would only be feasible if the fact of loss was proven. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 In making his case, Mr Lobo highlights Mr Wong’s representations that the core management team possessed the necessary expertise and experience to bring the Target Companies to greater heights. These representations are encapsulated in a projection made during a presentation in November 2014 from Mr Wong to Mr Liong that suggested that the profits of the Target Companies would increase from the base year of 2013, by 188% in 2015 and 255% in 2016.

</div> Nevertheless, Mr Lobo is not making the argument that the projections in the presentation were contractually binding promises, nor is he suggesting that there is a case in misrepresentation. Moreover, these early projections were expressly qualified by various assumptions which unsurprisingly, did not actualise, such as the Target Companies being fully acquired by 2014, “no loss of existing accounts” and a minimum year on year growth of the existing accounts at 17%.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 In the present case, no loss is proved. The claim fails without the necessity of a full consideration of the issue of causation. Mr Lobo’s arguments nevertheless illustrate the instructive nature of Lord Toulson’s observation in <span class="font-italic">AIB</span><span class="font-italic"> Group (UK) plc v Mark Redler &amp; Co Solicitors </span>[2014] 3 WLR 1367 (“<span class="font-italic">AIB</span>”) at [70] that trusts which are commercial in nature have parameters marked by contract and it is artificial if a court does not take cognisance of those parameters. Referencing Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Target</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd v Redferns</span> [1996] AC 421, Lord Toulson makes the point that the scope and purpose of a trust may vary, and this may have a bearing on the appropriate relief in the event of a breach. Referring at [71] to Professor David Hayton (in <span class="font-italic">Unique Rules for the Unique Institution, the Trust</span>, Degeling &amp; Edelman (eds), <span class="font-italic">Equity in Commercial </span><span class="font-italic">Law</span> (2005, Lawbook Co) at pp 279-308), Lord Toulson highlights that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rather, the fact that the trust was part of the machinery for the performance of a contract is relevant as a fact in looking at what loss the bank suffered by reason of the breach of trust, because it would be artificial and unreal to look at the trust in isolation from the obligations for which it was brought into being.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 Lord Toulson’s statements in <span class="font-italic">AIB </span>were made in the context of a commercial bare trust, whose contractual terms closely defined the fiduciary relationship. In my opinion, the point is one of wider relevance. In contrast to traditional trust relationships between beneficiary and trustee, within commercial relationships, parties deal with each other contractually to further their mutual interests. In so doing, each may expect the other to act as defined by their contractual obligations and to take reasonable steps to avoid or mitigate any loss. More so when an experienced businessman and an industry veteran have negotiated extensively on the applicable contracts ahead of a business venture with foreseeable risks. In the present case, while Mr Wong’s fiduciary obligations arise out of his position as a director, <span class="font-italic">this </span><span class="font-italic">particular head of loss</span> that YGG claims arises from the Deed of Undertakings, one of the multiple contractual documents which Mr Liong put in place to formalise their respective responsibilities. It is the Deed of Undertakings that gives rise to Mr Wong’s duty to second the core management team, in pursuit of which he has shown a lack of honesty and fidelity. There is no evidence, however, of the true capability of the team: YGG relies on the sales pitch of Mr Wong. Nor is there any evidence to show how the team would have fared any better than the management team that Mr Liong put in place in their absence. In these circumstances, where a claim for damages for breach of contract would fail because of the ‘but for’ test for causation, it would in my view be just to apply, for this particular head of claim, the same test to the claim for equitable compensation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judgment in Suit 80</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 I therefore grant judgment in Suit 80 in the sum of US$828,415.87 and RMB3,247,306.63 to YGG. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether YGG ought to be wound up</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In Suit 107, MCH, Mr Wong and Mrs Wong contend that YGG, together with YGL, Mr Liong, Mr Tan and Mr Ang, were in a lawful or alternatively, unlawful, conspiracy.

As for Suit 107, although Mr Wong’s pleadings named YGG as a party to the alleged conspiracies, his submissions do not attribute any acts of conspiracy to YGG. The commencement of Suit 104 and Suit 337 did not involve YGG. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that YGG was in any way involved in any of the acts that form the basis of Mr Wong’s claims in conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 There is, in addition, a wider assertion that it is “impossible to conduct the business of [YGG]” as it has become apparent that Mr Liong is no longer willing to work with Mr Wong in the joint venture.

There is no unfairness on the part of Mr Liong, whose action in taking control of YGG and its management has been reasonable.
