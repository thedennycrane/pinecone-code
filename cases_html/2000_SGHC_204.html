<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Brief facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    The accused,

Thiruselvan s/o Nagaratnam, was a lashing worker working in the Port of Singapore

Authority (‘PSA’). He resided at Blk 645 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, #12-4995,

Singapore. He was charged with abetting one Katheraven s/o Gopal (‘Katheraven’)

in trafficking in 807.6 grams of cannabis on 13 January 2000 at about 3.40 p.m. at Ang Mo

Kio Avenue 6, Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    The prosecution led

evidence that Katheraven met an undercover Narcotics Officer, Sgt Andrew John Joachim

(‘Andrew’), at Blk 123, Bukit Merah View on 13 January 2000 at about <b>2.45 p.m</b>.

Katheraven offered to sell 1 kilogram of cannabis to Andrew at a price of $2200 plus $500

as commission. Andrew asked if the price could be lowered. Katheraven made some calls on

his handphone (number 97603714) and spoke in Tamil. Later Katheraven told Andrew that the

price could not be lowered. Upon confirmation of the deal, Katheraven made some calls on

his handphone number 97603714. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    Based on the Mobile

One (Asia) Pte Ltd records, there were 4 successive outgoing calls from Katheraven’s

handphone traced to a pager no: 96069940 belonging to the accused between 3.00 pm and 3.04

pm. followed by a return call from the accused’s home telephone number 4525161 at

about 3.05 p.m., which lasted for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Another call came

through to Katheraven’s handphone a few minutes later at 3.13 p.m. again from the

accused’s home telephone and this call was 1 minute and 43 seconds long.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    Katheraven then

informed Andrew that his supplier was about to leave his house. As Katheraven had to go to

Ang Mo Kio to collect the drugs, Andrew obliged Katheraven by giving him a lift in his

car. Katheraven directed the way and eventually, they arrived at the car park at Blk 646

Ang Mo Kio Street 61 at about <b>3.30 p.m.</b> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    Katheraven informed

Andrew that he would be back in ten minutes. He then got out of the vehicle and walked

towards the direction of Blk 648 Ang Mo Kio. The telephone records showed that

Katheraven’s handphone had been used to page the accused’s pager twice at 3.36

p.m. and 3.40 p.m.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    Subsequently,

Katheraven was seen running back towards Andrew carrying something underneath his T-shirt.

He got into the vehicle, lifted his shirt and took out a slab of cannabis, which was

tucked in his pants. After Katheraven handed the slab to Andrew, he was arrested.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    Following

Katheraven’s arrest, there were altogether 20 incoming calls to Katheraven’s

handphone from the accused’s home telephone between 3.49 p.m. and 6.37 p.m., which if

not answered, would be diverted to the voice mail facility on Katheraven’s handphone.

Cpl Anan Devan (‘Anan’) testified that Katheraven’s handphone rang several

times but he answered only four calls, all of which were from the same caller.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1<sup>st</sup> telephone call</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    According to Anan, he

answered the 1<sup>st</sup> call at about <b>7.20</b> p.m. Based on the telephone records,

there was an incoming call to Katheraven’s handphone at <b>7.13</b> p.m. lasting some

2 minutes and 28 seconds from telephone number 4549968 which was a public phone at Sin

Hong Heng Department Store at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio #01-952. It was not disputed that the

accused had made this call. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    It would appear that

the times indicated in the telephone records and those recorded by the CNB officers were

out of synchronization by about 7 minutes. I suspected this to be the case with the other

times given by the rest of the CNB officers in their conditioned statements. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    The caller in this 1<sup>st</sup>

call asked for "Kathi". Anan told him that "Kathi" was not around and

that he was holding on to Katheraven’s handphone. When the caller asked who he was,

Anan said that he was a friend of "Kathi". The caller identified himself as

"Thiruchy". Anan could not remember most of the other details of the

conversation. However, he distinctly remembered the caller saying in Tamil, "Porula

Edutha Karsai Tharunam", which meant, "If the thing is taken, the money must be

paid." Anan then told the caller that he would not cheat him but would pay him the

money.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    Anan believed that

the caller mistook him for someone else and he informed the other members of the CNB team

of it. When asked by defence counsel, who the witness thought the accused had mistaken him

for, Anan said it could be someone who had purchased the drug and who would be able to pay

him the money. Counsel put to Anan that the accused had told him the following in this 1<sup>st</sup>

call:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Kathi (in short for Katheraven) had

  got him into some trouble.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Kathi had taken something using his

  name.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) People were there now demanding money

  from the accused.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Kathi was to come down to Ang Mo Kio,

  Blk 632 to sort out the matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) He was to tell Kathi to bring down the

  money and pay them off.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    Anan denied that the

accused had said any of the above to him. He maintained that the accused told him to pay

up the money whereupon he replied that he would come and pay the money, and that he would

not cheat him. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2<sup>nd</sup> telephone call</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    Shortly thereafter,

the same caller (i.e. Thiruchy) called Kathevaren’s handphone and Anan answered the

call. The telephone records revealed that this 2<sup>nd</sup> incoming call at 7.30 p.m.

was again from the same public phone. It lasted a short 31 seconds. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Thiruchy asked for

Kathi. Anan said he was not around. Anan then asked where he wanted the money to be handed

over to him. Thiruchy replied that he would be at the coffee shop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio.

Anan asked how he was to recognise him. Thiruchy said that he would be wearing a

‘Milan’ white soccer jersey and a pair of soccer shorts. Anan told him that he

would be there shortly to pass him the money.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    Counsel put to Anan

that he told the accused that he would come with Kathi down to Blk 632. Anan disagreed.

Anan further denied that the accused ever told him to come down quickly and that the

people were waiting. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    It made no sense for

Anan to say that he would be bringing Katheraven with him since Katheraven had been

arrested. Undue suspicions would be raised if Anan were to be seen coming without

Katheraven. I was thus inclined to believe Anan’s evidence. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3<sup>rd</sup> telephone call</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    Whilst Anan was

proceeding to Ang Mo Kio, Thiruchy called him again asking when he would reach the coffee

shop. Anan informed him that he was on his way. From the records, this 3<sup>rd</sup> call

was at 7.47 p.m. from telephone number 4520742 lasting some 1 minute and 53 seconds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    Counsel put to Anan

that similarly in this third call, the accused had expressed his grievances repeatedly,

"Look, Kathi has put me in trouble. What are you guys doing? You all have spoilt my

name. People are chasing me now. Come down quickly." Anan categorically denied this. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4<sup>th</sup> telephone call</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    On arrival, Anan

together with SSgt Mohd Azam spotted a male Indian fitting the description of Thiruchy in

the company of two other male Indians in a coffee shop at Blk 632, next to an open garden

as was earlier described by Thiruchy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    At about <b>8.15</b>

p.m., Thiruchy called again. The telephone records showed a call made from a public phone

(no: 4522407) at Lian Gee Huat Restaurant at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio #01-948 to

Katheraven’s handphone at <b>8.09</b> p.m. lasting some 41 seconds. The

out-of-synchronization in the timing would be some 6 minutes. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    At this 4<sup>th</sup>

and final telephone call, Thiruchy asked Anan where he was and whether he was on his way.

Anan told Thiruchy that he was in the vicinity but he did not feel safe to go to the

coffee shop. Instead, he would meet him in front of the bus stop at Blk 639 Ang Mo Kio

Avenue 6. Thiruchy agreed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    Counsel put to Anan

that the accused had told him that the party waiting to collect the money had left and

therefore Anan need not come. Again Anan disagreed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Arrest of the accused</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    At the bus stop, the

accused was arrested. He was wearing a ‘Milan’ white soccer jersey. It was put

to Anan that he had asked the accused where were the people now i.e. those persons waiting

to collect their money. Anan denied that he had ever asked that question. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    When the accused was

being brought to his registered address for a search, the accused denied that he was the

caller or that he was known as "Thiruchy". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    Upon reaching the

accused’s flat, Anan knocked on the door and a lady, later ascertained to be the

accused’s wife, opened the door. When Anan asked her in Tamil if Thiruchy was in, she

said that he was not at home. At this juncture, the accused shouted in Tamil that he was

only known by his first name ‘Thiruselvan’. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    The accused was

later brought back to Ang Mo Kio Police Division HQ for an Instant Urine Test for

controlled drugs. He was tested positive for opiates.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Voluntary statements of the accused</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    As the accused had

not challenged the voluntariness of several statements given, they were accordingly

admitted into evidence without any voire dire. I would set them all out.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    At 10.45 p.m. on 13

January 2000, Inspector Xavier Lek recorded the following answers of the accused to his

questions:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Do you know Katheraven s/o Gopal?<br/>

  A: I do not know his real name but I know him as ‘Kathir’.</font></p>

  A: By my wife. My wife stay in Bukit Merah in the past and get to know him.</font></p>

  A: I went to take money and then take bus to interchange.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Who are you take the money from?<br/>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Who is your friend?<br/>

  A: My friend is ‘Thambi’, he used to sit with me at the coffeeshop of Blk 632

  Ang Mo Kio.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: How can you find ‘Thambi’?<br/>

  A: I can find him at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio coffeeshop.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Do you know ‘Thambi’ contact

  number?<br/>

  A: I don’t know. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    At 2.10 a.m. on 14

January 2000, the accused gave the following answers which ASP Fan Tuck Chee (‘ASP

Fan’) recorded in his field book:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q1: Why were you arrested?<br/>

  A1: Because I went to take the money. One of my friends tell me to go and take the money

  from somebody.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q2: Who is your friend?<br/>

  A2: His name is ‘Thambi’. He is a Malaysian.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q3: How did ‘Thambi’ inform you

  to collect the money?<br/>

  A3: He paged me to ask me to come to the coffeeshop. ‘Thambi’ then called me and

  asked me to collect the money from a man with black shirt and trousers. He also asked me

  what I wear and told him I am wearing soccer shirt and trousers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q4: What time did ‘Thambi’ page

  you?<br/>

  A4: 3 to 4 o’clock.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q5: What number?<br/>

  A5: A handphone starting with 9760. The rest I can’t remember.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q6: How did you call him back?<br/>

  also ever see me with my wife.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q11: How many times did you call

  ‘Thambi’ on the day when you were arrested?<br/>

  A11: 2 times. Both from home. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    In another statement

given later at 3.40 p.m. to ASP Fan, the accused explained that his urine was tested

positive because he had taken a cough mixture. He stated, inter alia, that on 13 January

2000, while he was with Shanmugam drinking beer at the coffee shop, Thambi telephoned him

and requested a favour from him to collect money from somebody as he had urgent matters in

Johor to attend to. Thambi asked him what he was wearing and the accused said that he was

wearing a ‘Inter Milan’ jersey and shorts. Thambi said he would call him again.

Thambi later called back and told the accused that he had already informed this person

what he was wearing. If a man wearing black shirt and trousers approached him, he was to

identify himself as a friend of Thambi and a sum of money of thousand plus dollars would

be given to him. The man would be at the bus stop in front of Blk 639 Ang Mo Kio. Thambi

said he would page the accused to collect the money from him. In this statement, the

accused denied knowing Katheraven. When ASP Fan showed him a photograph of Katheraven, the

accused did not recognise him. The accused denied knowing that the money he was collecting

was drug money. He was only helping a friend whom he did not know was involved in drugs. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    In his cautioned s

122(6) statement recorded 5 days later on 19 January 2000, the accused denied the charge

of abetting Katheraven in an offence of trafficking and stated the following in his

defence:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I do not know this person at all. I have

  never spoken to him also. An acquaintance of mine requested me to do a favour for him. He

  told me to collect money supposed to be given to workers from a person. When I asked him

  how I could recognise him, he told me that the person would be wearing black shirt and

  black pants and would be waiting at the bus-stop. He asked me what attire I would be

  wearing and I told him I would be in a football attire. I further told him that I would go

  there but I would leave immediately if I could not see the person and I would not wait as

  I have to buy some things for my children. I went there but left the place when I do not

  see anyone there. When I was walking away, some men came and arrested me. I do not plea

  guilty to this charge. The salary that I am earning is more than enough for my family. As

  such, I do not have to do this. I will not trust any friends anymore. Please show leniency

  towards me for something I have not done.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    Up till now, the

accused was giving the version that he did not know Katheraven. In this version, he had

not spoken with Anan in any of the said 4 telephone calls. Neither had he arranged with

Anan to meet at the bus stop where he was eventually arrested. He merely agreed to do <b>a

favour</b> for Thambi who instructed him to collect a sum of over a thousand dollars from

a person wearing black shirt and trousers at the bus stop. There was no mention that he

was threatened or compelled by Thambi or Joe into doing it. Neither was there any mention

of any conversation concerning a $300 loan by Katheraven at this stage.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    Some 6 days later on

25 January 2000, the accused gave a further statement to ASP Fan where he said that he had

not told the whole truth. I noted that the accused had plenty of time by now to mull over

his case and the events. He said that he had not mentioned ‘Joe’ a friend of

Thambi. He now admitted knowing Katheraven and that Katheraven did contact him on 13

January 2000 and that he had given him his pager number 96069940. Katheraven called him

‘Thirichi’. He narrated the following the events that took place on 13 January

2000:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">24. On 13 January 2000 at about 2

  something in the afternoon, ‘Kathi’ paged me and asked if ‘Thambi’ had

  called me. He also told me that he had arranged to meet ‘Joe’ or

  ‘Thambi’ and ‘Thambi’ was actually supposed to call him. As I had the

  number of ‘Joe’ then, ‘Kathi’ asked me to call ‘Joe’ and I

  agreed. I then called ‘Joe’ and told him that there was an arrangement between

  ‘Thambi’ and ‘Kathi’ to meet up and ‘Kathi’ is waiting for

  the call from ‘Thambi’. ‘Joe’ informed me that he is aware of the

  arrangement and he is waiting for ‘Thambi’s call. Further to that,

  ‘Joe’ asked for ‘Kathi’s phone number and told me that he will contact

  ‘Kathi’ when he reaches Ang Mo Kio. In the meantime, I am to inform

  ‘Kathi’ that ‘Joe’ is on the way to Ang Mo Kio. All this while, I was

  using my house phone to contact both ‘Joe’ and ‘Kathi’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">25. About 30 to 40 minutes later,

  ‘Kathi’ paged me again. I returned his page and he informed me that he is on the

  way to Ang Mo Kio. I then gave him the handphone number of ‘Joe’ so that he

  could contact ‘Joe’ direct. I cannot remember "Joe’’s handphone

  number now because I wrote in on a piece of paper and I had already returned it to

  ‘Joe’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">26. About another 10 minutes later,

  ‘Kathi’ paged me to ask if I will be there to see him. I replied no and he hung

  up the phone. ‘Karthi’ had paged me using his handphone and I cannot remember

  the number. I am now given my pager to check for ‘Kathi’’s handphone number

  but I cannot recall which is the handphone number of ‘Kathi’. (Recorder’s

  note:- Accused was asked to identify the handphone number of ‘Kathi’ from his

  pager which was seized but he could not identify any).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">27. On 13.1.2000 at about 6.40 p.m., while

  I was at the coffeeshop at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio Street 61 with ‘Shanmugam’,

  ‘Thambi’ approached me when ‘Shanumgam’ was not around. He asked me to

  follow him to the coffeeshop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio Street 61 as ‘Joe’ is at that

  coffeeshop. I told ‘Thambi’ that I could not leave as yet and asked

  ‘Thambi’ to go back first. When ‘Shanmugam’ returned, I told him that

  I have to go somewhere and left for the coffeeshop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio. Shanmugam was

  still at the coffeeshop when I left.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">28. When I reached the coffeeshop at Blk

  630 Ang Mo Kio, ‘Joe’ and ‘Thambi’ were sitting there.

  ‘Thambi’ then asked me how well I know ‘Kathi’ and I replied that he

  is a close friend. ‘Joe’ asked me where ‘Kathi’ is staying and I asked

  him why he needs to know the home address. ‘Thambi’ then told me that on

  12.1.2000, when ‘Thambi’ managed to get ‘Kathi’ on his handphone and

  ‘Kathi’ asked him to recommend a seller for something. I asked

  ‘Thambi’ what is that something and he told me that it is ‘<b>ganja</b>’.

  ‘Thambi’ also told me that he recommended ‘Joe’ who sells ‘<b>ganja</b>’

  to ‘Kathi’. He also told me that on 13.1.2000, ‘Kathi’ contacted

  ‘Joe’ directly and I was asked how did ‘Kathi’ get

  ‘Joe’’s number as ‘Kathi’ was supposed to wait for

  ‘Thambi’ to call. I replied that I was the one who gave the number to

  ‘Kathi’. ‘Joe’ then told me that ‘Kathi’ took the

  ‘thing’ from him and when ‘Joe’ asked for the money, ‘Kathi’

  told him that he will return the money later. ‘Joe’ initially refused but

  ‘Kathi’ said that he is a very close friend of mine and finally ‘Joe’

  agreed with the arrangement. ‘Joe’ also informed me that ‘Kathi’ took

  the ‘<b>ganja</b>’ and never came back. ‘Joe’ insisted that I pay <b>$2,220/-</b>

  on behalf of ‘Kathi’ and I refused. We quarrelled and ‘Joe’ asked me

  to return the money by 8 o’clock that night but he did not tell me how am I going to

  hand over the money. ‘Joe’ threatened me that if I do not return the money by 8

  o’clock, he will harm me. He also told me that the money used to buy the ‘<b>ganja</b>’

  is workers’ money and they need the money back. I told them that I will contact

  ‘Kathi’ and if I find him, I will ask him to pay up. I then left and returned to

  the coffeeshop at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio and met up with ‘Shanmugam’ again.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">29. At the coffeeshop at Blk 632 Ang Mo

  Kio, I called ‘Kathi’ on his handphone and somebody answered the phone, it was

  not ‘Kathi’. I spoke to the person in Tamil and asked him who he was and the

  person identified himself as ‘Kathi’’s friend. He asked me to leave a

  message. I then told the person on the line to ask ‘Kathi’ ‘what did he

  take away just now’ and that ‘the people here are waiting for the money’. I

  also told the person to inform ‘Kathi’ to come to the coffeeshop at Blk 632 to

  return the money. The person said that he will inform ‘Kathi’ and asked me to

  call in to the handphone again. All this while, I have been at the coffeeshop at Blk 632

  Ang Mo Kio. (Emphasis is mine).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    In a further

statement on the following day, 26 January 2000, the accused elaborated on the calls he

made to Katheraven’s handphone with Anan as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">31. …..On 13.1.2000, at about 7

  something in the evening, I called into ‘Kathi’’s handphone from a public

  phone at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio coffeeshop. The purpose of me calling ‘Kathi’ is to

  ask him to repay the <b>$2,220/-</b> to ‘Joe’. The person answering the call

  asked me who I am and I replied that I am ‘Thirichi’. After I had informed him

  about the purpose, the person asked me where I was and I told him I was at the coffeeshop

  at Blk 632 Ang Mo Kio. The person then asked me to call back as ‘Kathi’ is not

  around. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">32. About 5 minutes later, I called

  ‘Kathi’ again using the public phone. The friend of ‘Kathi’ answering

  the call told me that ‘Kathi’ was busy. I told the person that ‘Kathi’

  had used my name and got me into trouble. I did not tell him that the trouble is

  concerning ‘<b>ganja</b>’. Without me asking, the person I talked to told me

  that he has got the money and he will bring the money down to me in 20 minutes time but he

  did not tell me the amount. I then told him to come as soon as possible and I will wait

  and show him who he was to pass the money to. I also told the person that I am wearing

  soccer jersey and shorts and he in return told me that he is wearing black shirt and

  trousers. Our conversation then ended. Karthi’s friend did not tell me his name.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">33. After I finished speaking to

  ‘Kathi’’s friend, ‘Thambi’ called me at the public phone and I

  told him about ‘Kathi’s friend handing over the money. ‘Thambi’ then

  told me that he and ‘Joe’ has to go and ask me to inform ‘Kathi’s

  friend that he will contact ‘Kathi’ on his own at 5 o’clock the next day to

  make sure that ‘Kathi’ pays up. I agreed and we ended the conversation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">34. When I returned to the table to drink

  with ‘Shanmugam’, he asked me what was the problem. ‘Boy’ [i.e.

  ‘Prakas’] was also there. I then told both of them that ‘Kathi’ had

  used my name to buy drugs and the people are now chasing for the money. I did tell them

  that ‘Kathi’s friend will be coming to see me with the money and I also told

  them directly that it is drug money. However, I did not tell them that the drugs refer to

  ‘<b>ganja</b>’.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">35. Just before I left the coffeeshop with

  ‘Shanmugam’ and ‘Boy’, I called into ‘Kathi’’s

  handphone again intending to ask him not to come to the coffeeshop. However, the person

  told me that he was already at Blk 639 Ang Mo Kio. I agreed and when I reached the

  bus-stop, I was arrested. (Emphasis is mine.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    From the above,

clearly Kathi’s friend (i.e. the undercover CNB officer Anan) was not coming with

Kathi to meet the accused to pay the money. The accused further knew the amount was

exactly $2,220. Again there was no mention of any $300 loan that the accused was going to

collect from Kathi at that meeting at the bus stop. The significance of all this would

only be apparent later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of Katheraven</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    The prosecution

called the accomplice, Katheraven, to testify. Katheraven admitted that he had pleaded

guilty in the High Court on 16 June 2000 to two trafficking charges in relation to a drug

offence committed on 13 January 2000. He was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and

24 strokes of the cane. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    Katheraven testified

that his friend, Selvan, had telephoned him at his home on 13 January 2000 at about 12.45

p.m. and asked for one kilogram of cannabis. Selvan said that his friend Andrew wanted it.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    Katheraven revealed

that he did page for the accused within half an hour of the call from Selvan. However, he

denied that the accused had called him back. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.    I did not believe

him. The telephone records revealed that at about 12.52 p.m., there was an outgoing call

from his handphone to the accused’s pager number not long after Selvan had called

asking for the cannabis. Within two minutes, there was an incoming call from the

accused’s home telephone number, and the call lasted 9 minutes and 53 seconds. I drew

the inference that Katheraven had spoken with the accused soon after Selvan had, at the

request of Andrew, asked for a kilogram of cannabis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.    When confronted with

this evidence, Katheraven simply evaded the issue and said he could not remember. However,

during cross-examination, he surprisingly recalled speaking with the accused at about 1.00

p.m. but it was about returning the $300 that he allegedly borrowed from the accused about

a week or two prior to his arrest. Katheraven denied discussing with the accused about

drugs in any of his telephone conversations with him. From the vacillations in his

evidence, I did not find him to be a reliable witness in court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    Katheraven then

claimed that at about 1.00 p.m., he used his handphone to call Joe Baskeran, who was known

to him for about a year and who had in fact supplied the cannabis to him. According to

Katheraven, Joe Baskeran’s number was 97517643. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.    When confronted with

the telephone records that there was no outgoing call from his handphone to Joe

Baskeran’s number, Katheraven quickly changed his evidence and said that he called

Joe Baskeran instead from a public phone. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    According to him, he

called Selvan after contacting Joe Baskeran. He then met up with Selvan and his friend,

Andrew. Andrew told Katheraven that he needed the ‘stuff’ <b>urgently</b>.

Andrew asked where he could get it and Katheraven told them that he would have to go to

Ang Mo Kio to get the stuff. Selvan and Andrew told him that if he was able to get the

stuff, they would pay him $500. Selvan left.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    Katheraven explained

that he then called Joe Baskeran on the public phone because his handphone battery was

weak. Thereafter, he went back home to get the spare batteries after telling Andrew to

wait for him. When he returned, he boarded Andrew’s car and they proceeded to Ang Mo

Kio. Whilst in Andrew’s car, he told Andrew the price. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    However, I noted

from Andrew’s evidence that there was no mention of Katheraven making any phone call

from a public phone or of him going home to change his handphone batteries. If it did take

place, in all probability those material facts would be stated in his evidence. I was

inclined to think that this story was fabricated on the spot by Katheraven to show that he

did call Joe Baskaran to arrange for the supply of the drugs so as to deflect the

culpability away from the accused. When his handphone records revealed that no calls were

made to Joe Baskaran, he had to lie that he used a public phone.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    Katheraven testified

that when he was in Andrew’s car on the way to Ang Mo Kio, he used his handphone to

page the accused. The accused returned his call. Katheraven purportedly told the accused

that he was going to Ang Mo Kio and that if he were to pass by his house, he would return

the loan of $300. But later in his testimony, Katheraven said that he could not remember

whether he had spoken to the accused about the return of the $300 whilst he was in

Andrew’s car. This indicated that the $300 loan might well be a red herring which had

to be scrutinised. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    On reaching Avenue

6, Ang Mo Kio, Katheraven told Andrew to park at a car park in Avenue 6. Katheraven got

out and proceeded to meet Joe Baskaran at the coffee shop at Blk 630. Joe Baskaran took

him to the toilet in this coffee shop and gave him one kilogram of cannabis. He tucked it

in his trousers and returned to the car park. He went into Andrew’s car and handed

the cannabis to Andrew.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    When asked by the

learned DPP whether he or anyone used his handphone whilst in the coffee shop, Kathevaren

said no one did. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    As his oral evidence

contradicted his previous statements, the learned DPP applied to cross-examine Katheraven.

I allowed the DPP’s application. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    Katheraven denied

that the accused was involved in the supply or sale of the drugs to him. He maintained

that he had not called the accused to ask if he had any cannabis nor tell him that he

needed one kilogram of cannabis. Neither did the accused tell him that he would arrange

for the Malaysian supplier to deal directly with Andrew. Katheraven again denied that the

Malaysian supplier had borrowed his handphone at the coffee shop to page for the accused

at 96069940.</font></p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Section 147 Evidence Act</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    As a result of these

material contradictions, the prosecution sought to admit the previous inconsistent

statements under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act as evidence of facts stated therein. I found

that these statements were admissible for that purpose.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    The controversies

surrounding the ambit of s 147 (3) of the Evidence Act were settled by the Court of Appeal

in <i>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 25</nobr>, where Yong Pung How

CJ delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal said at p 58:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">..Section 157 (c) [of the Evidence Act]

  provides for the impeachment of a witness’s credit by proof of former inconsistent

  statements. Section 147 contains the general scheme governing cross-examination on

  previous inconsistent statements. Section 157 could not be said to bring in only s 147 (1)

  and (2). This point had already been dealt with in <i>Sng Siew Ngoh</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 143</nobr>

  at pp 149-150 as follows:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear then that there is a general

    scheme governing cross-examination on previous statements. Section 157 of the Evidence Act

    cannot be said to only bring in sub-s (1) [of s 147]. The other subsections also govern

    the cross-examination of previous statements. They cannot be separated from sub-s (1).

    Through this reference to s 147, the whole of that section is brought in, including s

    147(3). It also has to be noted that s 147 (3) explicitly states that it applies ‘in

    any proceedings’, and does not purport to be restricted to specific circumstances,

    which would have to be the case had it been intended that s 147(1) were to operate

    independently of s 147 (3).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, the consequences that follow

  upon proof of a former statement inconsistent with any part of the witness’s evidence

  which is liable to be contradicted are first, that his credit is impeached under s 157(c)

  and second, that his former statement is admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein

  under s 147 (3). The weight to be attached to the statement is determined by the factors

  stipulated in s 147 (6).</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.    In a recent decision

<i>Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor</i> (Criminal Motion No 9 of 2000) delivered on 21

August 2000, the learned Chief Justice succinctly set out the factors that the court

should consider when determining the weight to be attached to a statement admitted under s

147. He said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">25. ….Section 147 (6) provides

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In estimating the weight, if any, to be

    attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be

    had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the

    accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not

    the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts

    stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to

    conceal or misrepresent the facts.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of <i>PP v Tan Kim Seng

  Construction Pte Ltd &amp; anor</i> (1997) 3 SLR 158, I said that, in addition to the

  above, other factors that will affect the weight accorded to such previous inconsistent

  statements are: (1) an explanation of the inconsistency, and why that statement is an

  inaccurate representation of the facts; (2) the context of the whole statement and the

  circumstances affecting its accuracy; and (3) the cogency and coherence of the facts to be

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">26.    This issue was further expounded by

  the Court of Appeal in <i>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP</i> (1999) 1 SLR 25 where I said:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">First, the contemporaneity of a statement

    with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against

    inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in

    question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these

    occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time but the recollection of the

    existence of a relationship is not so malleable. Second, there can be little guidance on

    the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be

    astute in spotting such instances. Third, in addition to the above matters, the weight to

    be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an

    explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of

    the facts. Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6)

    does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires

    consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must

    consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the

    statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is

    taken out of context. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon

    has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight. </font></p>

<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Inconsistent statements of Katheraven</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.    I would deal

separately with the 3 inconsistent statements made by Katheraven viz (a) the Statement of

Facts (‘SOF’) which he admitted to in Court when he pleaded guilty; (b) the

signed statement given on 16 June 2000; and (c) the signed statement recorded on 20

January 2000. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.    In determining the

weight to be given to the statements admitted for the purpose stated in S147 (3), I gave

full consideration to the factors elucidated in <i>Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor.</i></font><b></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Statement of Facts (SOF)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.    Katheraven initially

claimed that the SOF was not read to him in court. In my judgment, he was obviously lying.

In the usual course, the SOF would have been interpreted and explained to him and he would

have admitted to them without qualification. Otherwise, the High Court would not have

convicted him on his plea of guilt. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.    Later Katheraven

changed his testimony and alleged that he admitted to untrue facts in the SOF in relation

to the accused’s involvement out of fear. This was dubious. Having been advised by

counsel, I found it difficult to accept that his admission without qualification to the

SOF in the High Court was involuntary or that he had admitted to facts in the SOF without

regard to whether he was wrongly accusing another innocent man of a very serious crime

because he was in fear. It was even more unbelievable that Katheraven was prepared to

falsely implicate the accused, who was his childhood friend, out of fear. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.    <font face="Times New Roman">In my opinion,

counsel advising accused persons pleading guilty in a court of law have a duty to confirm

with their clients that whatever material facts in the SOF that their clients are

admitting to are factually accurate and true, and their admissions to the SOF are

completely voluntary. If not, they are to advise their clients to qualify the SOF

accordingly. If for some reason their clients are unable to articulate their

qualifications to the SOF read out and interpreted to them in court, counsel have to

assist by pointing out to the court parts of the SOF that their clients wish to qualify

and they should state unequivocally that their clients’ admissions to the SOF are

involuntary if that were to be the case. The court will then have to decide whether to

accept the plea of guilt and to convict accordingly based on the SOF as qualified.

Counsel’s responsibilities assume even greater importance where the SOF implicates

another person in a commission of a serious offence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.    In this case, there

was no evidence before me that counsel acting for Kathevaren had acted in dereliction of

his basic duties to his client and to the court when his client pleaded guilty. When the

court asks an accused person whether he is admitting to the SOF without qualification

(which necessarily includes a qualification of involuntariness if any), and the accused

confirms to the judge that he is, that SOF becomes an oral voluntary confession or

admission of the accused under s 17 of the Evidence Act, which is a situation analogous to

s 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code where a Magistrate records a statement or confession

made to him before the commencement of an inquiry or trial. For these reasons, I did not

think that there would be any need for a voire dire prior to admitting the SOF for the

purpose stated in s 147 (3).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.    In the SOF, it was

stated that Katheraven had used his handphone to contact the accused and request for one

kilogram of cannabis. The accused informed him that he would arrange for the supplier to

meet him. The accused reminded him that the drugs would cost $2220. When he informed the

accused that the payment would only be made after the buyer had inspected the drugs, the

accused agreed. The accused thereafter instructed him to meet a man wearing a blue shirt

and trousers at the coffee shop at Block 630 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 to collect the drugs from

him. Katheraven met the supplier, who gave him a block of vegetable matter. This supplier

told Katheraven to pay the accused for the drugs. Katheraven then handed over the drugs to

Andrew, who posed as a buyer. Katheraven was arrested subsequently. The block of vegetable

matter seized was analysed by the Department of Scientific Services to contain 807.6 grams

of cannabis and 115 grams of cannabis mixture.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">61.    In my opinion,

the SOF was admissible as a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement of Kathevaren

and as proof of the substantive facts stated therein under S 147(3) of the Evidence Act in

the light of his denial before me of those material facts in the SOF in relation to the

accused. In this regard, I would most respectfully quote what the learned Chief Justice

Yong Pung How had said after an extensive review of the relevant law in <i>Public

Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo</i> <nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 699</nobr>:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I therefore took the view that the

  statement of facts, properly classified as a confession for the purposes of s 17 [of the

  Evidence Act], was a statement made by PW4. It was a statement on which he could be

  properly cross-examined under s 147 of the Act. I also found that if such statement was

  properly proved against him, the statement could be used as proof of the facts stated

  therein by virtue of s 147(3) of the Act .. …. </font></p>

<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Statement P49 dated 16 June 2000</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.    Following his plea

of guilt and conviction, a further statement P49 was obtained from the potential witness,

Katheraven, in the presence of his counsel on 16 June 2000 in the lock-up of the High

Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.    It was in the form

of a conditioned statement where Katheraven declared that his statement was true to the

best of his knowledge and belief and that he had made it knowing that, if it was tendered

in evidence, he might be liable to prosecution if he had wilfully stated in it anything he

knew to be false or did not believe to be true. Recording P49 in the presence of his

counsel was a prudent step to take as it necessarily ensured that the statement so

declared to be true was not made under any pressure, threat or harassment and there could

be no suggestion of impropriety of any kind. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.    In court however,

Katheraven denied that he had given that conditioned statement. He only admitted to his

signature on the last page of P49. The prosecution consequently led evidence from ASP Fan

and the interpreter Mohd Ferdhouse to prove that he did make the statement in P49. ASP Fan

testified that no threat, inducement or promises were made to Kathevaren before or during

the recording of that statement. He saw Katheraven sign on all three pages of his

conditioned statement after Mohd Ferdhouse had read through everything to him in Tamil,

and after Katheraven had confirmed that his statement was correct and he had no amendments

to make. Katheraven later admitted in his oral testimony that Mohd Ferdhouse did ask him

whether it was his statement. When he told him that it was, Mohd Ferdhouse asked him to

sign and he did. I thus found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that

Katheraven had given his signed conditioned statement in P49.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.    P49 was obviously

not a statement recorded from an accused person by a CNB officer in the course of an

investigation. Having been convicted, Katheraven was no longer under any investigation nor

was he an accused person at the time when his statement was taken. He was merely a

potential witness giving a conditioned statement. Hence, I saw no necessity for any voire

dire (whether in practice or in law) to determine the voluntariness and hence, the

admissibility of P49 prior to admitting the statement for the purposes provided under s

147 of the Evidence Act since the conditioned statement was recorded when Katheraven was a

mere witness, and since Katheraven was not a co-accused in this trial. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66.    At the application

of the learned DPP, I admitted P49 under s 147(3) as that statement similarly contradicted

his testimony in court that the accused was not his drug supplier but Joe Baskaran was.

P49 was admissible as evidence of facts stated therein of which direct oral evidence by

Katheraven would be admissible. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.    Just as with his

earlier SOF, Katheraven continued to implicate the accused in paragraphs 5 and 6 of his

P49 statement:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">5.    After that, ‘Selvam’ left

  as he had to stand-by at his workplace and I told ‘Andrew’ that if he wanted the

  stuff, I could get for him. I also told him to drive me to Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 as I wanted to

  collect the stuff there. While I was with ‘Andrew’ in the car, I called

  ‘Thirichi’ (Thiruselvan s/o Nagaratnam) to ask if he had any stuff, which I was

  referring to cannabis. I told ‘Thirichi’ in Tamil that I needed 1 kilogram of

  cannabis. He told me that he would call me back in about 5 minutes time. About 5 minutes

  later, ‘Thirichi’ called me back at my handphone and I told him that I am

  driving to Ang Mo Kio and asked if the stuff is ready. He answered that he had already

  arranged for the stuff and told me that the stuff costs $2220/- and asked me to call him

  again when I reached the carpark of Blk 645 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. He would then arrange for

  the Malaysian supplier to deal direct with ‘Andrew’. I told ‘Thirichi’

  that ‘Andrew’ does not want to deal direct with the cannabis supplier.

  ‘Thirichi’ asked me why ‘Andrew’ was scared and I told him not to

  worry, as ‘Andrew’ is my friend. ‘Thirichi’ then told me to meet a man

  called ‘Joe’ in blue shirt and trousers at the coffeeshop of Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio

  Ave 6 and identify myself. The man will hand to me the cannabis and I would pay him.

  However, I told ‘Thirichi’ that the buyer wanted to see the stuff and would only

  pay upon seeing the stuff. ‘Thirichi’ agreed to the payment arrangement and ask

  me to make sure that the money is paid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">6.    After I reached Ang Mo Kio Ave 6,

  ‘Andrew’ dropped me off at the carpark of Blk 646 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 and I walked

  to the coffeeshop at Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio. At the coffeeshop, the Malaysian used my

  handphone to call the number 96069940. In the toilet, the Malaysian handed over a block of

  cannabis to me. The cannabis was wrapped in plastic and put into a black plastic bag. As

  it was bulky, I threw away the black plastic bag and hid the block of cannabis by tucking

  it into my trousers. The Malaysian told me that he needed to go out somewhere and asked me

  to give the money to ‘Thirichi’. At that time, I was thinking of paging

  ‘Thirichi’ and paying him the money after I had collected it from

  ‘Andrew’. I then left the coffeeshop and headed back to

  ‘Andrew’’s car. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.    At first, Katheraven

said that he gave his statement in P49 in fear as he was afraid that something might

happen to him. He explained that the Investigating Officer (‘IO’) had told him

during the recording of this statement that he would be hanged. Later he retracted his

evidence and said that the IO did not say that to him. Katheraven was undoubtedly an

unreliable witness in court. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69.    As counsel was

present when his P49 statement was obtained, I found it hard to accept that he was still

fearful of the CNB officers. Moreover, he was no longer in their custody but in the

custody of the prison officers by now. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70.    To explain the

inconsistencies and contradictions with his testimony in court, Kathevaren thereafter gave

a fresh reason that he had falsely implicated the accused in P49 because he was afraid

that the DPP might appeal against his sentence if he did not sign his P49 statement. He

admitted however that it was his own self-generated belief and not what the DPP or his

counsel had told him. Later on, he explained that he was in a confused state of mind and

that he did not understand what was being interpreted to him. However, he agreed that he

did not inform ASP Fan or the interpreter, Mohd Ferdhouse, that he did not understand what

was interpreted to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71.    I was not prepared

to give any weight to these lame reasons, which I believed he concocted in court to

dissociate himself from the facts he himself had stated in P49 in order to save his

childhood friend from the noose if he could.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Statement P 29 recorded on 20 January

2000</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72.    I turn now to the

statement P29 made by Katheraven on 20 January 2000 at 3.00 p.m. to ASP Fan, which was

interpreted by Ms Caroline Edmund, a part-time foreign language interpreter. Since

Katheraven admitted in his testimony that P29 was his signed statement, proof of the

statement was dispensed with when the DPP sought to have it admitted as evidence of the

facts stated therein under s 147(3).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73.    I observed that

nothing in s 147 (3) requires the admissibility of a statement of a witness (including one

who might have been an accomplice or an accused person) to be subject to additional proof

of voluntariness. Similarly there is no specific statutory provision for admissibility for

the purposes under s 147 (1) (2) or s 157 (c) to be subject to the requirement of

voluntariness.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74.    In my opinion, the

safeguards for ensuring the reliability of statements admitted under s 147 are found in s

147 (6). If a statement has been involuntarily extracted from any witness (and all the

more so from a witness who at the time of giving the statement was an accused person), the

weight of that statement admitted for the purpose under s 147 (3) may be significantly

reduced although its admissibility per se remains unaffected. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75.    But there appears to

be an accepted practice to conduct a voire dire prior to admitting a statement taken when

the witness was an accused person or an accomplice under investigation. If the statement

is found to be involuntary under the very strict voluntariness requirements under s 24 of

the Evidence Act or s 122 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, is the entire statement

inadmissible per se under s 147 (or for that matter inadmissible also under s 157(c) ) of

the Evidence Act? If so, then the involuntary statement could never be used to contradict

the witness under s147(1) or to impeach his credit under s 157(c) even if there was no

intention to use the contents in that statement to prove the facts stated therein under s

147(3) of the Evidence Act. That seemed extraordinary to me. To give sensible efficacy to

the various provisions, it would in my view be consistent not to introduce any impediment

based on involuntariness to the admissibility of a statement of a witness, who might well

be an accomplice, or perhaps even an accused person who had given a previous statement in

another criminal matter totally unrelated to the trial at hand. It would be preferable to

treat involuntariness as just another of the multifarious factors that ought to be taken

into account when deciding what weight should be given to that previous inconsistent

statement of a witness having regard to the specific purpose for which that inconsistent

statement was permitted to be used under the Evidence Act.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.    As such, once proved

as a statement made by the witness, it would be admissible per se, and evidence could then

be led by the parties on all matters that would impinge on the weight to be given to the

contents of the statement, whether it be <i>(a)</i> to impeach the credit of the witness

under s 157 (c); <i>(b)</i> to reduce or negate the effect of his sworn testimony in court

contrary to his previous statement under s 147 (1); or <i>(c)</i> as evidence of facts

stated therein under s 147(3). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77.    Accordingly, I

admitted P29 into evidence under s 147 (1) and (3) without a voire dire upon the

confirmation by Katheraven that it was his statement recorded by ASP Fan although he was

both an accomplice and an accused person under investigation at that time. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78.    Kathevaren similarly

testified that he was in fear when P29 was recorded. He said that the IO had told him that

he would be hanged. He allegedly gave a false statement in P29 out of fear. ASP Fan was

recalled and gave evidence denying that he had told Katheraven in the course of recording

P29 that he would be hanged or words to that effect. ASP Fan testified that no threat,

inducement or promises were made to him during the recording of P29. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79.    The learned DPP

referred me to paragraph 17 of P 29 which substantially reflected what was stated in

paragraph 5 of P49. The other paragraphs of P29 relied on by the DPP to contradict

Katheraven’s testimony in court were: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. After much thinking, I decided to tell

  that other than myself, another person was involved. The other person is known as

  ‘Thirichi’. …He gave me his telephone number 4593616 and his other contact

  number 96069940 when he was working with me. ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">13. ‘Thirichi’ now works as a

  lashing worker at the port. Sometime in 1999, I got to know that he has contacts in

  cannabis as he told me that if there is anybody who wants cannabis, I can contact him and

  introduce buyers to him. He also told me that he will give me whatever he afford as

  commission.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Weight to be given to the SOF, P29 and

P49</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80.    Applying the above

factors laid down in <i>Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor</i>, I decided to place far

more weight on what Kathevaren had stated in P29 and P49 and admitted to in the SOF than

his sworn testimony in court exonerating the accused.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81.    P29 was a statement

made by him fairly contemporaneously, about 7 days after the drug transaction in question.

P49 and the SOF were given on 16 June 2000 some 5 months later. Katheraven was consistent

throughout that period of 5 months and never wavered in implicating the accused as the one

who arranged for the supply of one Kg of cannabis to him. Although the accused might be

under considerable strain when giving his statement in P29 after having been arrested for

a capital offence, and he might be apprehensive in court when he pleaded guilty and

admitted to the SOF, however I did not find any fear, pressure or intimidation or any

motivation that would cause him to falsify an account in P29 of the involvement of his

childhood friend in a very serious offence, or to admit to an untrue account in the SOF.

Further, P49 was given after his conviction and sentence. Hence, there should be no good

reason to be fearful any longer. All this while, he continued to maintain his story of the

accused’s involvement. I concluded that Katheraven decided to reveal the

accused’s involvement in all his previous statements because that was simply what

happened.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82.    In my opinion,

Katheraven’s change of mind to give false testimony before me in court denying the

accused’s involvement came about only recently when he was called by the prosecution

to testify.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83.    Since his oral

evidence pertaining to the purported phone calls to Joe Baskaran had been contradicted by

the objective phone records, I gave no weight to his testimony that Joe Baskaran was his

drug supplier. His handphone records showed indisputably that he never contacted Joe

Baskaran on that day. Neither were there any incoming calls to Katheraven from Joe

Baskaran’s handphone. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84.    On the contrary, the

numerous pages to the accused’s pager from Katheraven’s handphone and the

numerous incoming telephone calls from the accused’s home telephone as revealed by

his handphone records in fact corroborated the SOF and the contents of P29 and P49, that

the accused was in constant contact with Katheraven on 13 January 2000. The inference I

drew was that Katheraven and the accused were not discussing about how Katheraven was

going to repay $300 to the accused (as that should not justify so many calls of such

apparent urgency) but that they were in continuous communication negotiating and arranging

for the supply and sale of the cannabis to Andrew, the undercover Narcotics Officer, who

needed delivery of the cannabis on that very same day on certain terms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85.    Thus

Katheraven’s evidence in court that the accused was not his drug supplier was totally

unreliable. In my judgment, Katheraven’s credit was impeached in relation to his

evidence exonerating the accused as his testimony in court was contradicted materially by

his former statements and his admitted SOF. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86.    I had carefully

scrutinised P29, P49 and the SOF and tested the alleged facts stated therein against the

evidence of the CNB officers and other objective evidence in particular the phone records.

I was mindful all the time that he was an accomplice and that he might have an incentive

to frame the accused in P29 to minimise his involvement, exculpate himself or to seek

leniency in any way he could. In this case, Katheraven had already confessed in P29 to his

commission of the offence before implicating the accused in his P29 statement. Thus, it

was significant that his subsequent revelation of the accused’s involvement was no

longer to minimise his own role or to exculpate himself. Needless to say, I still

exercised caution in taking account of Kathevaren’s three inconsistent statements for

the truth of their contents. I had carefully considered in detail Katheraven’s

explanations for the contradictions between his former statements and his oral testimony,

which for the reasons given earlier were wholly unsatisfactory. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.    In court, Katheraven

exonerated the accused and retracted all the parts in his statements that implicated the

accused to help him. In my judgment, his testimony was highly suspect, if not untruthful. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of the Accused</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88.    Counsel for the

accused did not make any submissions that the accused had no case to answer after the

prosecution closed its case. Having found that there was a prima facie case for the

accused to answer, I called on the accused to give his defence with the usual allocution.

He elected to give evidence on oath. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89.    The accused

vehemently denied that he was involved in any manner. He admitted knowing Katheraven since

1993 and had given his pager number to him. When he moved to Ang Mo Kio in January 1999,

they had maintained contact. Katheraven used to page for him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90.    He testified that

his conversations with Katheraven on 13 January 2000 pertained to the repayment of the

$300 which Katheraven had borrowed from him and were not about drugs. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91.    The accused

explained that the numerous calls from his home (telephone no: 4525161) and from the

coffee shop public phones at Blk 632 (telephone numbers: 4520742 and 4522407) to

Katheraven up to about 6.37 p.m. were to collect the $300 borrowed some 2 weeks earlier,

which Katheraven promised several times previously to repay but never did. This was the

first time that the accused brought up the existence of this $300 loan and linked it to

his telephone conversations with the accused on 13 January 2000. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92.    At about 6.30 p.m.,

the accused decided to meet one Shanmugam at the coffee shop at Blk 632. Shortly

thereafter, Thambi, who had sold VCDs to the accused, came and joined them. Thambi then

told the accused that he had something important to discuss with him. He asked the accused

to follow him to the coffee shop at Blk 630. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93.    At Blk 630, the

accused met Joe, a close friend of Thambi, who had on occasions delivered VCDs on behalf

of Thambi to the accused. The accused had previously introduced Katheraven to Thambi, who

in turn had introduced Katheraven to Joe. Thambi had given Joe’s contact number to

the accused about two days prior to his arrest. The accused subsequently gave Katheraven

the telephone number of Joe when Katheraven asked for it so that he could contact Joe

regarding payment for VCDs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94.    Thambi then asked

the accused whether Kathi had telephoned him. The accused said that he did. Joe asked if

the accused knew where Kathi was staying since he was a close friend of Kathi. The accused

said yes. Thereafter, Thambi said that Kathi telephoned him the previous day to arrange to

buy some stuff, which was clarified to the accused to be controlled drugs. Thambi spoke to

Joe and both then made some arrangements in respect of the stuff.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95.    They informed the

accused that Kathi had taken the stuff from Joe earlier. Kathi told them that he would

return later to pay for the stuff. Kathi assured them that he would not cheat them. They

could trust him because he was a close friend of the accused. On this basis, Joe allowed

Kathi to take the stuff. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96.    The accused’s

defence was that this was the first time he heard of Kathi taking the stuff from Thambi

and Joe. He claimed that he was shocked and surprised that Joe was a drug pusher.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97.    Thambi then asked

the accused how Kathi knew of Joe’s telephone number. The accused told Thambi that he

gave Kathi the telephone number.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98.    Joe then insisted

that Kathi had used the accused’s name and asked for the stuff. Having been given the

stuff, he had not returned to pay for it. Joe told the accused, "Since Kathi is your

friend, you call him." Joe asked the accused to call Kathi to come. The accused told

Joe that he had never consulted him before giving the stuff. Therefore, he told Joe that

he could not pay for Kathi. Thambi said that they had used the money meant for their

workers to purchase the drugs which they had given to Kathi. They expected Kathi to pay

them. Joe and Thambi then insisted that the accused pay for the drugs on behalf of Kathi.

They also said that the accused could collect the money from Kathi as he was his friend.

The accused reiterated that he could not do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99.    Pausing here, it

seemed rather strange that Joe and Thambi would hold the accused liable to pay for what

Kathi took simply because the accused was Kathi’s friend. Then all of Kathi’s

friends would be liable to pay even though they were not involved in any way with the drug

transaction. Could it be that the accused was really the middle man who brokered the drug

transaction and when the accused did not receive the money from Kathi, the accused himself

therefore could not pay Joe and Thambi, who supplied the drugs? Under the circumstances,

Joe and Thambi would naturally hold the accused responsible for payment. I would also

expect Joe and Thambi to be angry with the accused for brokering the drug deal with a

buyer who refused to pay after taking the drugs. To my mind, that was a far more realistic

scenario.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100.    According to the

accused, Joe got up from his seat and shouted at him. Joe asked the accused to call Kathi

and ask him to come by 8.00 p.m. and pay them the money, otherwise he would do something

to him and Kathi. In reply, the accused said that he would look for Kathi. If he could

locate him, he would tell Kathi to see them. However, Joe and Thambi did not inform the

accused of the amount of money which Kathi had to pay. Neither did they tell the accused

that it was cannabis that they had supplied to Kathi. Hence, apart from knowing that it

was a controlled drug, he was unaware of what type it was and how much it cost. It did not

occur to him to ask either Joe or Thambi. It might be pertinent to observe at this point

that the accused was able to furnish details about the price and the kind of controlled

drugs involved in his statements to the CNB. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101.    Since Thambi

already had Kathi’s handphone number given by the accused, I wondered why they could

not call Kathi themselves. The accused explained that Thambi told him that Kathi did not

respond to their calls. So they wanted the accused to call Kathi.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">102.    The accused pointed

out in his evidence that his statement to the IO was incorrect that Joe had asked him

personally to return the money by 8.00 p.m. that night. He maintained that Joe told him to

get in touch with Kathi and get Kathi to come and pay the money by 8.00 p.m. But in the

next breath, the accused testified that he and Joe had quarreled and Joe asked the accused

to pay on behalf of Kathi. If so, then what need was there for Kathi to come and meet Joe

and Thambi and make payment again to them, which would then amount to a double payment.

The story of the accused was internally inconsistent. Either the accused was to pay them

on behalf of Kathi, or Kathi was to pay them directly but not both. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103.    At that time, the

accused noticed the handle of a knife which was tucked at Joe’s waist. However, there

was no evidence that Joe had taken out his knife to threaten the accused. Neither had Joe

threatened the accused that he would kill or knife him if he did not get Kathi to pay

them. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">104.    At that juncture,

Prakas passed by the coffee shop and the accused was still quarrelling with Joe. Prakas

asked them what was happening. The accused told Prakas that Kathi had used the

accused’s name and obtained some stuff from Joe and Thambi, thereby getting him into

trouble.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105.    In the midst of his

heated argument with Joe, the accused testified that he opened his pouch at his waist and

took out the card where he had written the name "Thambi" and the telephone

number of Joe, and threw it on the table where Joe was at, saying that he would have

nothing to do with them anymore. In my opinion, this conduct of the accused throwing the

name card in front of Joe indicated that the accused was hardly afraid of Joe, whom he

alleged had a knife. He was even brave enough to enter into a long heated argument with

Joe and Thambi. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">106.    The accused then

told Joe and Thambi that he would call Kathi and ask him to come. Then the accused quickly

added that he would first ask Kathi why he had used his name and taken the stuff. He would

also ask Kathi to see both Joe and Thambi.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107.    Thereafter, the

accused told Prakas that Shanmugam was at the other coffee shop at Blk 632. He told Prakas

to join Shanmugam first and he would join them later. The accused subsequently proceeded

to Blk 632. As he was walking away, Thambi called out from behind telling the accused to

call Kathi to come and there would not be any problem. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108.    On the way, the

accused stopped at the phone booth to telephone Kathi. Thambi stood beside him. When the

accused telephoned and asked for Kathi, the person on the other line answered that he was

not in and that he had gone downstairs. The person also said that he was Kathi’s

friend. When this person asked the accused for his identity, the accused told him that he

was Thiruchy. The man asked the accused why he had called. The accused allegedly said that

Kathi had earlier called to return the money borrowed from him. He also told the man that

Kathi had put him into some kind of a problem and that those people were asking him for

money. At the same time, he also asked the man to ask Kathi what stuff (i.e.

‘porul’ in Tamil) that Kathi had taken from Ang Mo Kio. The man said that he

would pass the message to Kathi. He then told the accused to call back after five minutes.

The conversation ended. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">109.    The accused denied

that he ever said in Tamil that ‘If the stuff is taken, money must be paid’. He

also denied Anan’s version that he told him that he would not cheat him but would pay

him the money. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">110.    I noted that the

contents of this 1<sup>st</sup> telephone conversation as put by defence counsel to Anan,

was far more elaborate than that described by the accused in his oral testimony. Anan

flatly denied the contents as put to him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">111.    At this stage, I

observed that it seemed very contrived that the accused should be asking the man to ask

Kathi what stuff was taken by Kathi, when he could so easily have asked that question of

Joe earlier or he could simply turn to Thambi, who was beside him, to ask what stuff was

taken by Kathi if the accused was so keen to know what kind of controlled drug was taken

by Kathi. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">112.    Continuing with the

accused’s version of the events, the accused said that he informed Thambi that it was

Kathi’s friend who answered the phone. He told Thambi that his friend would ask Kathi

about it. Thambi comforted the accused by telling him not to be upset over what had

happened. Thambi then asked the accused to call Kathi five minutes later. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113.    The accused called

again. Kathi’s friend picked up the phone. The accused asked if he had asked Kathi.

Then the man said that he and Kathi would be coming with the money. When the man wanted to

know where they should meet, the accused informed him to meet at the coffee shop at Blk

632 at Ang Mo Kio. The accused then said that he would show him the men (i.e. Joe and

Thambi) who wanted the money. He told the man to pay the money to those men. The

conversation ended.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">114.    During

cross-examination, the accused changed his version of the 2<sup>nd</sup> call somewhat.

The accused said that he asked Kathi’s friend if Kathi was around. Kathi’s

friend said that Kathi was busy with work. He again said that Kathi had got him into big

problems. The person then said that Kathi was just here and that he would bring Kathi and

the money along. He told Kathi’s friend that he would tell them the exact problems

and show them the persons, i.e, Joe and Thamby, and then they could deal with these

persons directly. When Kathi’s friend asked the accused where he was, he told them

that he was at the coffee shop at Blk 632. The accused agreed with the learned DPP that he

never mentioned to Kathi’s friend that he had been threatened by Thambi and Joe.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">115.    At this juncture, I

noted that Anan had in his testimony denied telling the accused at any time that he would

come with Kathi down to Blk 632. He maintained that the accused never told him to come

down quickly because the people waiting to collect the money were waiting. What the

accused was trying desperately to do in his defence was to create the impression that he

was not the one who wanted the drug payment urgently. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116.    Continuing now with

the accused’s evidence, the accused said that after he put down the phone, Thambi

returned to the coffee shop at Blk 630 where Joe was. The accused went to join Shanmugam

and Prakas instead at the coffee shop at Blk 632.. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117.    I found it rather

strange that Thambi and Joe should prefer to wait at one coffee shop and the accused would

wait for Kathi at another coffee shop in a different block, if the money was in fact to be

paid over directly to Joe and Thambi on an urgent basis and the accused had also intended

to show Kathi’s friend the persons, Joe and Thambi, who were demanding for payment of

the cannabis money. I would have imagined that Joe and Thambi who were desperate enough to

use Kathi to collect payment for them, would surely want to wait at or very near the place

where Kathi and his friend were expected to come to, bringing with them the money that

they (i.e. Joe and Thambi) wanted so badly. I believed that the story was fabricated in

this way because the CNB officers did not keep watch at the adjacent coffee shop which

then enabled this version to be cleverly fabricated without other available evidence for

contradiction. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118.    Whilst the accused

was with Shanmugam and Prakas, the accused told Shanmugam that Kathi had used his name and

had taken some stuff and then gone away. Those people whom he took the stuff from were now

asking the accused for the money. The accused informed Shanmugam that he had telephoned

Kathi and that Kathi’s friend had answered saying that he and Kathi were on their way

to meet him at this coffee shop. Significantly, the accused never called either Shanmugam

or Prakas to testify and provide some corroboration to this crucial part of his defence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119.    The accused then

testified that he telephoned the third time from the coffee shop. Kathi’s friend

answered the call saying that he <b>and Kathi</b> were on their way to meet him and would

be arriving in about 20 minutes time. The accused said that he would be at Blk 632.

Kathi’s friend said he had gone to that place but nobody was there. Kathi’s

friend then asked how the accused was dressed and what he was wearing. The accused replied

that he was wearing a football uniform. The accused then asked the man, "You said you

came earlier. How are you dressed? How can I identify you?". The man told the accused

that he was dressed in a black shirt and black pants. When the man said that he was not

familiar with that place, the accused told him that Kathi knew this coffee shop just in

front of his block. The call ended.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">120.    Again, it was

incomprehensible that the man would have said that he had been to the coffee shop and

found nobody there, when he and Kathi were still on their way there and would be arriving

in 20 minutes time. Secondly, if indeed Kathi was accompanying the man, why was there the

need to explain to the man how the accused would be dressed since Kathi obviously would be

able to identify the accused, and bring his friend to meet him. The accused’s version

was inherently incredible. In fact at paragraphs 32 to 35 of the accused’s own

statement given earlier on 26 January 2000, it was very clear that only Kathi’s

friend was coming and Kathi was not. Anan (masquerading as Kathi’s friend) had denied

telling the accused that Kathi was coming with him. I found that the accused was

deliberately lying. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121.    In relation to this

third call, defence counsel put something quite different to Anan that the accused had

told him that Kathi got him into trouble and other people were demanding money. The

accused basically was pouring out his grievances all over to Anan again. Anan disagreed.

Material differences between what was put to the prosecution witnesses and the

accused’s testimony in court often do indicate the unreliability of the

accused’s oral evidence. In this instance, I gave the benefit of doubt to the accused

that there might have been a mix up in the accused’s instructions to his counsel. I

might add that since Anan was already on the way with the money, I could not see any good

reason why the accused should be complaining and repeating his grievances to Anan in this

third call.<i> </i></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122.    The accused then

related that a short while later, he received a telephone call at the public phone in the

coffee shop where Thambi told him that he and Joe had something to attend to and were

leaving. Thambi then said that he would be calling Kathi on their own to collect the money

from him. The accused immediately told Thambi that Kathi and his friend were on their way

and asked why they were leaving. Thambi reiterated that he and Joe had something very

important to attend to and they would contact Kathi to collect the money <b>on their own</b>.

During cross-examination, the accused added that Thambi had also told him to tell Kathi

that he (i.e. Thambi) would call Kathi the next day. Thambi however did not ask the

accused to collect the money on their behalf. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123.    This part of the

story was quite unbelievable. According to the accused, Joe and Thambi thought that Kathi

was trying to cheat them and was not returning their calls. Hence, they needed to compel

the accused to call Kathi, as only then he would come down to see them. Joe and Thambi

were already waiting so long for Kathi to come and pay them a substantial sum of money of

some $2000. They needed the money desperately to pay their workers. Since the accused had

successfully got Kathi to come down, what was the problem in waiting a little while more?

Under the circumstances, it seemed quite out of character not to seize the opportunity to

collect payment from the elusive Katheraven, whom they had no alternative but to resort to

the accused to make contact in the first place. Why would they would want to go away, and

then risk collecting payment from Katheraven themselves on another day? If indeed they

were so confident of collecting payment from Katheraven on their own later, then I could

not see the reason for this roundabout manner of getting the accused to make calls to

Katheraven to chase for and to collect payment on their behalf. The story did not quite

make sense to me. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124.    The accused

testified that he went back to his table to continue drinking with Shanmugam and Prakas.

He subsequently called Kathi’s number (4<sup>th</sup> call) with the intention of

informing Kathi or his friend that Thambi and Joe had left but Kathi’s friend told

the accused that they were already in the vicinity at Blk 639. He then told Kathi’s

friend to go to the coffee shop at Blk 632. But the man said to go to the bus stop at Blk

639. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125.    The accused

categorically denied that Anan had told him that he was in the vicinity and that he did

not feel safe going to the coffee shop but would meet him in front of the bus stop of Blk

639. I found Anan’s version to be more realistic and credible. There could be no good

reason why they could not meet in the coffee shop where the accused was. Why must the

accused go to a bus stop to meet Anan? I preferred Anan’s evidence that he cooked up

that reason to lure the accused out from the coffee shop.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">126.    The accused’s

sequence of events also seemed unlikely. I would have imagined that he would call

Kathi’s friend <b>immediately</b> to cancel the appointment upon being told that Joe

and Thambi could not wait. Instead the accused went back to continue with his drinking.

This was more consistent with the fact that it was the accused himself who wanted to

collect the money for himself. After waiting a fairly long period of time, and when Kathi

and his friend still failed to show up, he became impatient. That was why the accused

called again. The telephone records revealed that the accused had waited for some <b>20

minutes</b> (see Katheraven’s telephone records for the time interval between the 3<sup>rd</sup>

and 4<sup>th</sup> calls) before he decided to call Kathi’s friend for the fourth

time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">127.    When he returned to

the table, the accused told Prakas that Kathi and his friend were near a bus stop and that

they had asked him to go there. Prakas said that he would like to come with him to find

out who Kathi’s friend was. The accused allegedly wanted to ask Kathi personally why

he used his name and put him into all this trouble. He also wanted to collect the $300

which Kathi owed him, and tell Kathi that Thambi would be calling him and that he had to

settle whatever he owed Thambi and Joe for the stuff he had taken from them. Further, the

accused wanted to ask what stuff it was. As explained earlier, it was most improbable that

Anan had told the accused that Kathi was accompanying him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">128.    It was obvious to

me that the accused needed to weave into his evidence, this motivation of his to see

Kathi, and the only way he could do so was to concoct a story that Kathi was indeed coming

along to the bus stop with his friend. Otherwise, he would have difficulty explaining why

he was waiting so long at the coffee shop with such anxiety to meet with Kathi and his

friend, if he was not going to confront Kathi with all those questions, clear his name and

collect his $300 loan, especially when Joe and Thambi had left and had told the accused

that they were going to collect the drug money from Kathi themselves on another day. It

was also intended to reinforce his defence that he was not involved but was dragged into

the picture by Joe and Thambi, which accounted for his action to clear his name. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">129.    Unfortunately for

the accused, he could not neatly stitch up his fabricated story as a whole and thus, in

material parts, it did not make much sense and showed up readily to be an unbelievable

story. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">130.    Shanmugam and

Prakash accompanied the accused to the bus stop but waited at Blk 645 behind the bus stop.

Subsequently, all of them were arrested. After the accused was handcuffed, he was

assaulted by Cpl Devan with many blows to his chest until he stooped down. The CNB

arresting officers were recalled and they denied assaulting him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">131.    During questioning,

the accused denied that he was Thiruchy because he was in fear and was confused. His

confusion arose because Kathi told him that the outstanding payment to Joe was in relation

to VCDs purchased but Joe and Thambi were saying that it related to drugs. He admitted

denying that he had called Katheraven’s handphone number when the CNB officers

questioned him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dispute on accuracy of recording of his statements</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">132.    Although there was

no challenge on voluntariness, the accused in the course of his evidence disputed the

accuracy of recording of his statements by ASP Fan and the interpretation by the

interpreter. This dispute on accuracy arose subsequent to the admission of the statements.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">133.    The accused firmly

maintained that he never used the word ‘ganja’ during the recording of his

statements. When the statements were read back to him and he pointed out that he did not

use the word ‘ganja’, he alleged that the interpreter became very confused and

angry. The accused also denied mentioning $2,220 as the price of the drugs during the

statement recording. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">134.    It was put to Ms

Caroline Edmund Susila that the accused, when giving the statements, had used the Tamil

word ‘porul’ referring to a ‘thing’. However, she was certain that he

never used this Tamil term. She remembered him using ‘jama’ instead to mean the

‘thing’. She also denied that during the recording of his statements, the

accused had complained to the recording officer directly that he did not use the word

‘ganja’. Ms Caroline testified that the accused had not objected to or disagreed

with anything during the recording of his statements. She clarified that her

interpretation was done systematically, line by line, and that it was not possible that

the accused had told her the reason why he went to the bus stop opposite Blk 636, which

she might have inadvertently omitted to interpret for recording by ASP Fan. She maintained

that if the accused had told her that he went to the bus stop because he wanted to collect

$300 from Katheraven, she would have interpreted it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">135.    The interpreter

confirmed that the accused did use the word ‘ganja’ himself several times. When

the accused used the word ‘jama’, she specifically clarified with him and the

accused told her that it was ‘ganja’. She maintained that ‘ganja’ was

not suggested to the accused but the word came from the accused himself. I believed her

evidence. Further, I would not think that she and the recording officer would have

concocted the price $2,220 for insertion into his statements if he never said it. She

appeared to me to have given her evidence in an honest and forthright manner. I found

therefore that the accused’s voluntary statements were accurately recorded.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">136.    Based on this, I

drew the inescapable inference that the accused knew at the time of giving the statements

that the drug trafficked was cannabis and it cost $2,220. I disbelieved his defence that

he did not know that the drug involved was cannabis and neither did he know of its price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of Josephine d/o Anthony</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">137.    The accused called

his wife, Josephine d/o Anthony, to testify on his behalf. She is currently detained at

the Changi Female Drug Rehabilitation Centre.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">138.    She confirmed that

Katheraven had paged for her husband on 13 January 2000. She testified that he spoke with

Katheraven on the phone. Her husband later told her that Kathi was going to return the

money borrowed from him including some monies pertaining to VCDs, which Kathi had bought

from her husband’s friend. She could not remember anything else. She also said that

her husband had asked her to get from his pouch a name card with ‘Thambi’

written on it, and her husband gave the number to Kathi over the telephone. This would

vaguely suggest that Kathi contacted ‘Thambi’ directly for the cannabis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">139.    When cross-examined

by the learned DPP why she never mentioned what her husband had told her to the CNB

officers, she said that she could not recall whether she had. She was later shown her

conditioned statement and she had to agree that she never mentioned those facts in her

statement. She explained that she was stressed up that her husband was arrested and it did

not occur to her to tell the CNB officers. I did not believe her as her statement was

recorded some 4 months after her husband’s arrest. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Defence counsel’s submissions </font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">140.    Learned counsel

emphasized that Katheraven had in P29 initially mentioned Joe Baskaran (‘Joe’)

as his drug supplier and he had also provided the handphone number of Joe in his

statement. He did not implicate the accused from paragraphs 1 to 11. Midway through the

recording, Katheraven suddenly decided to change his mind and implicated the accused

instead as the one who arranged for the supply of the cannabis to him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">141.    <font face="Times New Roman">Counsel contended

that something must have influenced Katheraven to change his statement and implicate the

accused. Katheraven probably was not able to provide more details about Joe Baskeran to

CNB, which would then lead CNB to think that Joe Baskeran was a fictitious character.

Counsel deplored the fact that the CNB did not ascertain who the subscriber of 97517436

was. He submitted that it could well have been the handphone number of Joe. Had CNB probed

further into this, the defence that Joe was not a fictitious character and indeed was the

supplier would well have been proven to be true. Sensing that he was making no progress

with the CNB regarding Joe and that his own future was at stake if CNB did not believe

him, counsel contended that Katheraven then substituted Joe with the accused. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">142.    Counsel managed

without any difficulty to get Katheraven to agree that those were the reasons for

implicating the accused via the following leading questions to him: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: On 20<sup>th</sup> January 2000 when

  you gave the statement. Do you agree you were found with the drug, a large quantity?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: And you also would have known that the

  only way you could have escaped the gallows is, if the prosecution showed some compassion

  to you or due to your co-operation they reduced the charge, you would have known.<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Now the prosecution--- the

  investigation officer must have certainly queried you on Joe, would have asked you for

  more details – Where is Joe staying, how did you meet him, what is his address?

  – he must have certainly queried you on these aspects, right?<br/>

  A: Yes, he did.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: And CNB would certainly have been

  interested in the supplier, in your supplier? <br/>

  A: Yes. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Am I right to say that when you could

  not furnish any details about Joe, CNB were suspicious of this character, Joe, that you

  had created, that you had stated?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Therefore, knowing that you cannot make

  any headway with them in respect of Joe and knowing that there’s no way CNB would

  help you if you did not reveal the name of the supplier, you substituted the accused with

  Joe.<br/>

  A: That’s the truth.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: And at that time you only considered

  about saving your own skin, your own life.<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">143.    With regard to the

SOF, Katheraven said that he wanted to save himself from the gallows and hence, he was

prepared to admit to the SOF prepared by the prosecution. He said that his counsel’s

assistant told him that he must accept the SOF to have the charge reduced, thereby

suggesting that he was accepting everything in the SOF, without caring whether they were

true or not, just to save his own life. He agreed with counsel for the accused that after

he was convicted, he was not bothered whether what was stated in P49 was truthful or not.

He just signed the pre-prepared statement as it no longer concerned him. Counsel submitted

that little weight should be given to P49 because it was given out of fear that the

prosecution might appeal against his sentence or it was given in the hope that his case

would be viewed favourably by CNB. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">144.    During his

re-examination by the DPP, Katheraven explained that the only reason why he subsequently

implicated the accused in his P29 statement was because he was afraid that something might

happen to him. He retracted the following reasons he gave at paragraph 21 in his P29

statement for implicating the accused:- </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">21.    I am now asked a few questions by

  the officer recording my statement.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Why did you not tell me that

    A: I do not want to get a bad name outside and I was also afraid that he will harm me and

    my family.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Then why did you decide to tell me

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">145.    His explanation for

saying that the accused was his drug supplier in his statements was to induce the IO to

believe him. However, he agreed that the IO did not promise him anything in exchange for

implicating the accused. When asked why he involved the accused if it were not true, he

said that he was frightened and in his fear, he implicated him. Dissatisfied the DPP

questioned him further on his reasons for falsely implicating the accused. His answers

were quite incomprehensible and unbelievable:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Witness, my question to you is, why did

  you choose to implicate Thiruselvan [the accused] in your statement instead of, let’s

  say, for example, choosing to implicate Joe or let’s say, choosing one of these two

  persons [referring to Shanmugam and Prakas] you have never seen before? <br/>

  A: I implicated him because he’s my friend.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">HIS HONOUR: So you prefer to implicate

  somebody you like and not somebody you don’t like?<br/>

  WITNESS: Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Witness, in your statement you had

  already implicated Joe. So why was there a need to, let’s say, additionally implicate

  Thiruselvan? Why was there a need to additionally implicate Thiruselvan since you had

  already implicated Joe?<br/>

  A: Because he was arrested and he was taken to MIB with me.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Witness, is that the only reason you

  implicated Thiruselvan?<br/>

  A: Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">146.    I further observed

that Katheraven was already in the early part of his statement P29 (at paragraphs 5, 6 and

7) indirectly implicating Thiruselvan if one were to study the objective telephone records

in conjunction with Katheraven’s statement. Katheraven only became more explicit in

implicating Thiruselvan from paragraph 12 onwards in his statement. It was most

significant that the telephone records were obtained <b>after</b> Katheraven had given his

statement. Neither the recording officer nor Katheraven could have referred to these

telephone records during the statement taking. Yet there were aspects of the telephone

records, which showed that whenever Katheraven stated that he was arranging for the drugs

with Joe on the telephone, one could trace that telephone conversation to the accused but

not to Joe. This was not some uncanny co-incidence. Further some of the calls which

Katheraven said were made to and from his handphone on the day of the incident could be

nicely matched with the telephone records.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">147.    For instance,

Katheraven said in his statement that when he was in Andrew’s car on the way to Ang

Mo Kio to take delivery of the cannabis from Joe Baskaran, he called Joe on his handphone

and he told Joe that a friend needed cannabis. Joe told him to meet at the coffee shop at

Blk 630 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 at 3.30 p.m. and he said that the ‘stuff’ i.e. cannabis

costs $2000. Katheraven called Joe again on his handphone to relay the message that Andrew

did not want to deal directly with him. In this call, Katheraven then arranged with Joe to

collect the cannabis himself and return later with the payment for it. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">148.    For these

arrangements, the purported conversations could not have been with Joe based on the

objective telephone records and on the timing. They must have been with the accused as

during this time, the telephone records showed convincingly that the only calls at that

time (i.e. at 3.05 p.m. and 3.13 p.m.) were those incoming calls from the accused’s

home telephone numbers. If one were to substitute the accused for Joe for those

conversations above, clearly Katheraven was already implicating that the accused was his

drug supplier in the early part of his statement in P29.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">149.    Another instance

was Katheraven’s disclosure in paragraph 7 of his P 29 statement that when he

alighted from the car in front of Blk 647, he met Joe at the coffee shop at Blk 630 as

pre-arranged. Joe borrowed his handphone to page his friend at 96069940. Joe then brought

him to the toilet and gave him one block of cannabis. This was again borne out by the

telephone records that there was indeed a page to the accused (not to Joe) in the course

of the cannabis delivery.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">150.    For these reasons,

I rejected counsel’s contention that it was a change of heart that Katheraven decided

to incriminate his childhood friend. I could find no reason for it unless it was true.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">My conclusions</font><i></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Failure to report to the police</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">151.    The accused claimed

that he was threatened by Joe with the knife and asked to call Katheraven or pay up for

the drugs on behalf of Katheraven. The accused in my opinion could easily have reported to

the police if he was truly not involved at all in the drug transaction. I would have

expected that of a reasonable person who was innocently caught under such circumstances.

There was no question that the accused had all the opportunity to make a police report if

he wanted to, especially after both Joe and Thambi had said they were leaving. Having seen

the accused testify, I did not think he would be so ignorant that he did not know that he

could protect himself by reporting the matter to the police or CNB and have Joe and Thambi

arrested. Counsel submitted that uppermost in the accused’s mind was to confront

Katheraven and clear his name. This paramount reason sounded hollow and unbelievable. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">152.    I would have

thought under the circumstances that uppermost on the accused’s mind would be to try

to seek the protection of the police for his and his family’s safety and that could

only be properly achieved by having Joe and Thambi arrested before they could come round

to threaten him again. He could easily lure Joe and Thambi out and be arrested. For

conviction for trafficking in drugs, they would be safely put away in prison for a very

long time if not hanged. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">153.    Instead of

reporting them to the police or to CNB, he was helping the two drug traffickers to collect

the purchase money for the drugs from Katheraven. By his own account, the accused was

prepared to abet these two drug traffickers in the drug transaction albeit under certain

purported fears and threats, which in law did not fall within section 94 of the Penal Code

which only exonerates a person compelled to commit an offence by threats, which would at

the time of commission, reasonably cause him apprehension of <b>instant death</b>. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Accused’s lies</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">154.The evidential value of lies was dealt

with by the Court of Appeal in <i>Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh</i> <nobr>[1994] 2 SLR 867</nobr>,

where the learned Chief Justice delivering the judgment said at p 876:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The English Court of Appeal in <i>R v

  Lucas (Ruth)</i> [1981] QB 720 has held that the mere fact that an accused tells lies

  should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, but that lies can in certain circumstances

  amount to corroboration because it indicates a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held

  at p 724 that there were four criteria to satisfy before a lie could amount to

  corroboration:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The lie… must first of all be

    deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the motive for the lie

    must be a realization of guilt and a fear of the truth. …. Fourthly, the statement

    must be clearly shown to be a lie by [independent] evidence …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">155.    I would now refer

to the series of deliberate lies of the accused:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) His initial denial that he spoke with

  Anan who was then holding on to Katheraven’s handphone;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) His denial that he was known as

  ‘Thiruchi’;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) His shouts to his wife to the effect

  that he was only known by his first name ‘Thiruselvan’; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Informing ASP Fan on 14 January 2000

  that he did not know Katheraven; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Suggesting in his statement to

  Inspector Xavier Lek that he did not personally arrange to meet the person wearing a black

  shirt and black pants at the bus stop, but that ‘Thambi’ did and thereafter

  instructed him to take the money from this person dressed in black (i.e. Anan);</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) Specific retraction of paragraph 5 of

  the accused’s statement given on 14 January 2000 where the accused said that Thambi

  had paged him at about 3 pm to 4 pm using a Singapore handphone number and Thambi had

  asked him to go to the coffee shop downstairs. In his evidence, the accused said that was

  untrue. He maintained that he did not have any sort of contact whether on the phone or

  pager with Thambi. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">156.    There was no reason

for the accused to lie in this fashion if he was truly innocent. Clearly, he was so afraid

of being found out that he was connected with the drug transaction of Katheraven that he

decided to dissociate himself as much as he could from the phone calls he made to Kathi,

and to deny knowing Kathi altogether. In (f) above, the accused also wanted to make sure

that he made no calls to Thambi between 3 pm to 4 pm as that could imply that after

Katheraven called him to arrange for the supply of 1 kg of cannabis, he in turn arranged

with ‘Thambi’ to deliver the drugs directly to Katheraven. All these denials and

specific retractions reflected his consciousness of his guilt and his attempts to conceal

his involvement. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">157.    In my judgment, the

accused was a clever liar who deftly weaved his evidence as closely as possible around the

objective facts to give it a veneer of believability. I saw through his lies and

contradictions which reflected more of culpability and guilt than innocence. He had no

hesitation to lie when it suited him. He was a witness of poor veracity and credibility.

He was a self-confessed liar as he himself testified that he just rattled off a story for

the IO to record and he did not tell the truth when he gave his statements. I thus

rejected his defence in court completely. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">158.    Counsel submitted

that the accused had lied that he did not know Katheraven and had given a different

explanation for his presence at the bus stop on 13 January 2000 because Katheraven had

told him earlier at Ang Mo Kio Police Station to deny that he knew him and Katheraven

would do likewise. Otherwise, the accused would be in deep trouble. Hence, it was

contended that what the accused did was reasonable. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">159.    I could not see how

counsel’s submissions would advance the case any further for the accused, as it would

demonstrate instead that both the accused and Katheraven were prepared to cooperate to

concoct lies for ASP Fan to record. It was apparent to me that they were doing the same in

their testimony in court.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">160.    Further, it would

suggest that Katheraven, having been caught red-handed, was already thinking of

exonerating the accused very early on soon after their arrest. As Katheraven was already

caught with delivering the drugs to the undercover CNB officer and had confessed to his

own role, I could not imagine him trying to save himself by simply implicating the

accused. It would appear that Katheraven had tried to shield the accused initially (which

necessarily implied that the accused was indeed involved with him), but Katheraven later

had a change of heart and decided to tell the truth in his statements. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">161.    In any event,

Katheraven himself disagreed with defence counsel that he had told the accused to deny

knowing him. One of them must be lying. Counsel submitted that the accused’s version

should be accepted because both the accused and Katheraven had the opportunity during

their urine tests to speak to each other and both had initially denied in their statements

that they knew each other. How this might help the accused’s defence was unclear to

me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Katheraven’s statements

implicating the accused</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">162.    I accepted the

learned DPP’s submissions that P29 and P49 revealed the truth of what happened. P29

was a contemporaneous statement of Katheraven. P49 was a statement given by Katheraven

after he had pleaded guilty and there was no real incentive for him to wrongly accuse an

innocent man if it were not true. The same applied to the SOF admitted without

qualification in the High Court when he pleaded guilty. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Telephone call records</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">163.    The account given

in P29 was surprisingly consistent with the call-tracing records which the CNB obtained <b>some

5 days after</b> P29 was recorded from Katheraven. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">164.    The call tracing

records on 13 January 2000 showed the close contact maintained between the accused and

Katheraven on the day of the cannabis transaction:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Katheraven paging the accused 4 times

  between 3.00 pm and 3.04 pm.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The accused calling Katheraven at 3.05

  pm and spoke for 3 minutes 20 seconds.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) The accused calling Katheraven at 3.13

  pm and spoke for 1 minute and 43 seconds.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Between 2.29 pm and 4.23 pm, there

  were no calls to or from anyone else except the accused on Katheraven’s handphone,

  which proved that while in Andrew’s car, Katheraven did not speak to anyone else

  except the accused.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">165.    In P29, Katheraven

had stated at paragraph 15 that when he was with Andrew in the car, there were 2 calls

about 5 minutes apart which were eventually borne out by the call-tracing records. (The

3.05 call ended at 3.08 p.m. The next call was at 3.13 p.m.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">166.    These calls were in

relation to the drug transactions. Andrew had requested Katheraven to collect the drugs

and deliver it to him. Andrew then sprung another surprise that he was not going to pay

until he saw the drugs. Obviously, Katheraven would have to make the delivery arrangements

and further check with his supplier whether it would be acceptable to take the drugs first

without paying. As such, I found that these last minute arrangements would have to be

carried out by Katheraven over his handphone during the time he was with Andrew. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">167.    The only person

that Katheraven was in contact with at this time was the accused. I therefore drew the

irresistible inference that the accused was Katheraven’s drug supplier. It seemed

highly implausible that the 2 calls made by Katheraven on his handphone to the accused

when he was in Andrew’s car on the way to Ang Mo Kio were in relation to other

matters unrelated to the drug transaction which was afoot. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">168.    The numerous calls

from the accused to Katheraven’s handphone soon after Katheraven’s arrest showed

a very anxious accused trying desperately to contact Katheraven who simply

‘disappeared’ without paying, as he was by then arrested. I did not believe that

it was because of the repayment of $300. I found that the accused had called to chase

Katheraven for payment of some $2200 for the cannabis he had taken. That was exactly why

he had told Anan that ‘If the thing is taken, the money must be paid.’ From its

context, ‘the thing’ could not have referred to the $300 loan but could only

refer to the one kg of cannabis under the circumstances. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Charge proved</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">169.    Taking into account

the cumulative effect of all the evidence, I found that the evidence pointed irresistibly

to the accused as the supplier of the cannabis to Katheraven. He acted as an intermediary

where he had arranged for the direct delivery to Katheraven from his Malaysian source but

payment for the drugs supplied would be directly to the accused. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">170.    Accordingly, I

found that the prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable

doubt. I then sentenced the accused in accordance with law. </font></p>
