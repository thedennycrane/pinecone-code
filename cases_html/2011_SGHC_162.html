<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case (Originating Summons 769 of 2010
                    (“OS 769”)) is one of two cross-appeals on several questions of
                    law which arise out of an arbitral award. The other is Originating Summons 759
                    of 2010 (“OS 759”). Two of the issues raised in the appeals are of
                    considerable importance in the construction industry, and, so far as I am aware,
                    have not yet been expressly decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Topmost Industries Pte Ltd (“the
                    Employer”) engaged AC Consortium Pte Ltd as the architect (“the
                    Architect”) and E S Tang Consultants as the quantity surveyor
                    (“the Quantity Surveyor”) in respect of a proposed project. On
                    15 January 2001, Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd (“LCS”) was
                    invited by the Architect, on the Employer’s behalf, to tender for the main
                    contract for the design and construction of an industrial building known as
                    “LW Technocentre” at 31 Toh Guan Road East, Singapore 608608
                    (“the Project”). During the final tender interview on 5 April
                    2001, LCS was informed that LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd (“LW”) would
                    be interposed as the main contractor and that it would instead be the design and
                    build sub-contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 8 May 2001, the Employer issued a letter of
                    award to LW, appointing it as the main contractor of the Project for a lump sum
                    price of $13,027,052.56. LW accepted the offer on 12 May 2001. In turn, LW
                    issued a letter of award to LCS on 14 May 2001, appointing it as the design
                    and build sub-contractor of the Project at a lump sum price of $9,451,780.80
                    (excluding Mechanical and Electrical Works (“M&amp;E Works”)). On
                    the same day, LW engaged Leun Wah Electric Co (Pte) Ltd (“Leun
                    Wah”) as the sub-contractor for the M&amp;E Works. Leun Wah in turn
                    engaged LCS to carry out those works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In relation to the main sub-contract works, LCS
                    accepted the offer from LW on 18 May 2001 and the formal sub-contract
                    document was subsequently executed on 30 November 2001. LCS was required to
                    complete the sub-contract works within 15 months from the commencement date of
                    the sub-contract. As this was 2 May 2001, LCS was required to complete the
                    works by 2 August 2002. Clause 16.1 provided that the works would be
                    deemed to have been practically completed upon receipt of a Temporary Occupation
                    Permit (“TOP”) from the relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 22 May 2002, both parties agreed that an
                    extension of time of some three months would be given to LCS. The precise
                    duration of the agreed extension was disputed before Mr Johnny Tan Cheng
                    Hye (“the Arbitrator”): <em>ie</em> whether
                    the completion date was extended to 31 October 2002, or to 2 November
                    2002. The Arbitrator held that the completion date was extended to
                    31 October 2002 and that this agreed extension was only for the delay
                    caused by late and short payments by LW before 22 May 2002. He also found
                    that LCS was entitled to four additional days of extension of time pursuant to
                    cl 25 due to exceptionally adverse weather. This finding extended the completion
                    date to 4 November 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Clause 27.1.2 of the sub-contract provides that
                    failure by the sub-contractor “to proceed regularly and diligently with
                    the performance of [the sub-contractor’s] obligations” is a ground
                    for termination of the sub-contract. On 2 January 2003, LW sent a notice to
                    LCS notifying it of its failure to proceed regularly and diligently with its
                    obligations, and in particular its obligation to complete the project by the
                    contractual completion date. LCS had assured LW on numerous occasions that the
                    TOP would be obtained by various target dates: 31 December 2002,
                    7 February 2003, 15 April 2003, and 10 May 2003. Due to the fact
                    that the TOP had not yet been obtained despite these repeated assurances, LW was
                    concerned with LCS’s ability to complete the sub-contract works. The final
                    straw was when LW complained on 6 May 2003 that, despite a payment of
                    $200,000 to LCS, many sections of the works were still incomplete. This
                    complaint was met with silence until 12 May 2003 when a terse reply was
                    sent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am sorry, my telephone and internet was temporarily disconnected due to
                        non-payment and was only connected on 9<sup>th</sup> May
                        2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are unable to continue to apply for TOP and are not capable to take
                        delivery of FSB certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">LW immediately terminated the sub-contract pursuant to cl 27.1.2.
                    After termination, various sub-contractors were engaged by LW to complete the
                    Project. The TOP was eventually granted on 1 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 22 June 2004, LW served a notice of
                    arbitration on LCS. The Arbitrator accepted appointment on 9 November 2007
                    and issued his award on 29 June 2010 (“the Award”). For
                    completeness, it is noted that a supplementary award was issued on 15 July
                    2010 to correct typographical errors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Leave to appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Appeals on questions of law arising out of an
                    arbitral award pursuant to s 49 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10,
                    2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) may only be brought with the leave
                    of the court or with the agreement of all the parties to the proceedings:
                    s 49(3). Initially, the parties applied for leave to appeal and their
                    respective applications came on for hearing before me on 29 October 2010.
                    During the hearing, both parties accepted that Art 5.5 of the sub-contract
                    stipulated that either party may appeal to the High Court on questions of law.
                    Art 5.5 is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties hereby agree and consent pursuant to sections 28 and 29 of the
                        Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Ed), that either party</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">may appeal to the High Court on any question of law arising out of an
                        award made in an arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">may apply to the High Court to determine any question of law arising in
                        the course of the reference</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and the parties agree that the High Court shall have jurisdiction to
                        determine any question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As this satisfied the requirement in s 49(3)(a), I granted leave
                    to both parties to amend their respective originating summons to include the
                    necessary prayers for the appeal proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Two issues arise from Art 5.5. First, in
                        <em>Poseidon Schiffahrt GmbH v Nomadic Navigation Co Ltd
                        (“The Trade Nomad”)</em> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 57, Colman J had to determine the issue of whether parties to an
                    arbitration agreement entered into <em>before</em> the
                    occurrence of a dispute or the making of an award could, by that agreement,
                    dispense with the need to obtain leave to appeal as a condition precedent to
                    mounting an appeal pursuant to s 1(3) of the Arbitration Act 1979. It was
                    argued that the phrase “parties to the reference” in
                    s 1(3)(a), which is similar to the phrase “parties to the
                    proceedings” in our s 49(3)(a), envisages that there already has
                    been a reference to arbitration at the time when consent was given.
                    Colman J rejected this argument because there was no policy reason why the
                    requirement of consent would be satisfied only if it was given after the dispute
                    was referred to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Secondly, on its face Art 5.5 states that the
                    parties agreed and consented “pursuant to sections 28 and 29 of the
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Ed)” that appeals on questions of
                    law arising out of arbitral awards may be brought. The appeal in this matter and
                    that in OS 759 are brought pursuant to s 49 of the present Act. This
                    precise issue was dealt with by Clarke J in <em>Taylor
                        Woodrow Civil Engineering Ltd v Hutchinson IDH Development Ltd</em>
                    (1998) 75 Con LR 1. Clarke J held that the more sensible
                    inference would be that the parties must have intended that either party would
                    have a right to appeal to the court on a question of law arising out of an award
                    regardless of whether the arbitration was governed by the Arbitration Act 1979.
                    Thus, he held that there was a right of appeal where the arbitration was
                    governed by the Arbitration Act 1996. This sensible approach was followed in
                        <em>Fence Gate Limited v NEL Construction Limited</em>
                    (2001) 82 Con LR 41.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Questions of law raised in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     OS 759 was filed a day before OS 769. I am
                    dealing with OS 769 first, however, because the decision in this appeal will
                    affect the resolution of the issues raised in OS 759.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     OS 769 was filed by LCS, the sub-contractor,
                    in an appeal in the following questions of law:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">where there were acts of prevention which caused

                            it was necessary for LCS to have been prevented from completing the
                            works by a prescribed date in order for time to be set at large
                            (“the first question of law”);</div>

                            only do so by reference to a reasonable time for completion of the works
                            (“the second question of law”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">where there were acts of prevention which caused

                            LW was entitled to exercise its contractual right under cl 27.4 of the

                            to carry out the works under the sub-contract (“the third
                            question of law”).</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Arbitrator’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Arbitrator considered several distinct
                    incidents which were relied upon by LCS to support its claim to an extension of
                    time. As LCS has only raised two of these incidents before me to support its
                    appeal, it will be unnecessary to deal with the others. First, it points out
                    that the Arbitrator found that there was late and under-allocation of Man-Year
                    Entitlements (“MYEs”). In order to deal with the dependency of
                    contractors on workers from non-traditional source countries, the Ministry of
                    Manpower (“the Ministry”) created a system of MYEs, in which each
                    MYE would entitle an employer or contractor to bring in one worker from
                    non-traditional source countries on a work permit for one year, while two MYEs
                    could be used to obtain a two-year work permit, and so on. LW received the
                    permit for piling and pile caps on 12 June 2001, and the permit for
                    building works on 5 July 2001. However, it only submitted the application
                    for MYEs to the Ministry on 27 July 2001. On 31 August 2001, the
                    Ministry granted 157 MYEs to LW. Of this amount, only 75 were allocated to LCS;
                    this fell short of the 83 which the Arbitrator held that LCS was entitled to
                    have. Additionally, he found that LW should have applied for the MYEs
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Secondly, LCS points out that the Arbitrator
                    found that there were late payments by LW. Clause 30.3.2 stipulated the
                    procedure for interim payments. In LCS’s applications for interim payment,
                    it was required to enclose a certificate from the Architect which stated the
                    amount due to it from LW. This procedure was not followed and LW treated the
                    applications as being invalid. After several complaints by LCS regarding what
                    they considered to be late payments, cl 30.3.2 was amended on 14 March 2002
                    to state that a certificate from the Architect was not required and that LW
                    would accept certificates from the Quantity Surveyor instead. The Arbitrator
                    held that because the agreed three-month extension of time was granted for late
                    and short payments before 22 May 2002, he would only consider the late
                    payments after that date. Between 10 June 2002 and 28 February 2003,
                    the Quantity Surveyor issued nine interim payment certificates, only two of
                    which were honoured by LW within the 14-day period stipulated in cl 30.3.3. The
                    Arbitrator therefore found that there were late payments by LW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Arbitrator found that there was delay to
                    the progress of the works due to these incidents, <em>ie</em>, late and under-allocation of MYEs, and late interim
                    payments. However, he found that LCS had failed to prove that these incidents
                    had caused a delay in the <em>completion</em> of the
                    sub-contract works for the following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in relation to the late allocation of MYEs, the
                            analysis by LCS’s expert was incomplete, and LCS only utilised the
                            MYEs in November 2001 although it was informed of the allocation in
                            mid-September;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in relation to the under-allocation of MYEs, the
                            analysis by LCS’s expert was incomplete; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in relation to the late payments, LCS’s
                            expert was unable to produce evidence that this had caused delay in
                            completion, and the managing director of LCS had stated that it had no
                            financial or cash-flow difficulties and that the complaints of late
                            payments were only raised to put pressure on LW to pay because he was
                            concerned that the latter was a $2 company.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Earlier in the Award, the Arbitrator had
                    stated that it was well-established that a contractor would only be entitled to
                    an extension of time if an employer’s risk event had caused a delay in
                    completion. As he found that LCS had failed to prove delay in completion due to
                    the incidents it relied upon, apart from exceptionally adverse weather, he held
                    that only a four-day extension would be granted for that incident. The
                    Arbitrator then dealt with the issue of whether time was set at large in the
                    following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">355    I now move to the issue whether time is set at
                            large... Generally, when a contractor is prevented from completing the
                            Works by a prescribed date by the employer’s or his agent’s
                            acts of prevention and the contract does not provide for extension of
                            the contract period or where it does so provide but the extension is
                            improperly withheld, then the contractual date for completion will cease
                            to apply and time is said to be set at large and the contractor is
                            required to complete the works by a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">356    [LCS] submitted that in this case, time is set at
                            large because their progress of works was delayed by the late and/or
                            under allocation of MYE and late... payments. [LCS] submitted that these
                            acts of prevention are not Relevant Events under Clause 25.4 of the
                            Sub-Contract [the extension of time clause]. In any event, they say that
                            no extension of time was granted by [LW]. However, I have found earlier
                            that both of these events although they did cause delay to the progress
                            of the works, there is no evidence adduced by [LCS] that they delayed
                            the ... completion of the Sub-Contract. A delay to progress of works
                            does not automatically result in a delay to completion. That has to be
                            proven, which [LCS] failed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">357    Accordingly, time for the completion of the
                            Sub-Contract works was not set at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     LCS argues that the Arbitrator erred in
                    reaching this conclusion despite finding that there was a delay in the progress
                    of the works which did not permit an extension of time under the sub-contract.
                    According to it, in order for time to be set at large it is not necessary for
                    there to be a delay in the <em>completion</em> of the works
                    which is attributable to the contractor. A mere delay in the <em>progress</em> of the works will be sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The effect of time being set at large</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Yap Boon Keng Sonny v
                        Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd and another</em> [2009]
                    1 SLR(R) 385 (“<em>Sonny
                    Yap</em>”), I described the effect of time being set at large in
                    the following terms (at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] contractor’s obligation to complete the works under
                        a construction contract within a prescribed period of time is premised on
                        the requirement that he is not delayed by reason of any “acts of
                        prevention” committed by either the employer or his agent. As Chow
                        Kok Fong, <em>Law and Practice of Construction
                            Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2004) states at
                        p 401:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An act of prevention operates to prevent, impede or otherwise make it
                            more difficult for a contractor to complete the works by the date
                            stipulated in the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>[T]he legal consequence of [time being set at
                            large] is that the date for completion originally stipulated in the
                            contract ceases to be the operating date for the completion of the
                            works. Additionally, the employer’s right to claim or deduct
                            liquidated damages is lost since there is no longer a valid date for
                            completion from which such damages can be
                        calculated</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     LW points out that LCS accepts that the time
                        <em>for completion</em> is what is set at large.
                    However, this in itself does not assist LW because LCS’s contention is
                    rather narrower: that although the <em>effect</em> is that
                    time for completion is set at large, this effect may be <em>triggered</em> by a mere delay in progress.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The rationale of the principle of time being set at large</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     LCS submits that the rationale for the
                    principle of time being set at large is two-fold. First, the contractual
                    completion date is provided on the basis that the contractor will not do
                    anything to impede the <em>progress</em> of the works by
                    the sub-contractor. It relies on my explanation in <em>Sonny
                        Yap</em> of time being set at large (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>, <em>supra</em>). Secondly, LCS
                    submits that it would be unfair if it was liable to pay liquidated damages even
                    though there were acts of prevention by LW because LW would be taking advantage
                    of its own wrong in having committed such acts. LCS cites Lord Esher MR in
                        <em>Dodd v Churton</em> [1897] 1 QB 562 at
                    566:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The principle is ... that, when one party to a contract
                            is prevented from performing it by the act of the other, he is not
                            liable in law for that default</em> ... [I]f the building owner
                        has ordered extra work beyond that specified by the original contract which
                        has necessarily increased the time requisite for finishing the work, he is
                        thereby disentitled to claim the penalties for non-completion provided for
                        by the contract. <em>The reason for that rule is that
                            otherwise a most unreasonable burden would be imposed on the
                            contractor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     LCS argues that there will be a most
                    unreasonable burden placed on it in the event that liquidated damages are
                    imposed for delays which are not entirely due to its fault. It asserts that
                    there would be no real prejudice to LW if time was set at large because LW would
                    still have a remedy by way of general damages for LCS’s breach of the
                    sub-contract. In essence, LCS argues that the principle of time being set at
                    large is based on the idea that a man should not be allowed to take advantage of
                    his own wrong; thus, this principle should apply equally to a breach by the
                    contractor which delays the <em>progress</em> of the works
                    because there would also be a breach of contract. While LCS accepts that an
                    express contractual provision may provide otherwise, it notes that such a
                    provision is absent in this case. Therefore, it says, LW’s breach should
                    set time at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     However, LCS’s reliance on <em>Dodd v Churton</em> in fact undermines its appeal. It is
                    clear from the paragraph cited by LCS that Lord Esher MR stated that there would
                    be a “most unreasonable burden” where there was undoubtedly a
                    delay in completion. In the sentence immediately preceding the last sentence
                    cited by LCS, Lord Esher MR contemplated a situation where extra work ordered by
                    the owner “has necessarily increased the time requisite for finishing the
                    work”. The two other judges (Lopes and Chitty LJJ) also based their
                    decision on the fact that there was a delay in the completion of the works.
                    Lopes LJ put the point quite clearly (at 567-568):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is a well-ascertained rule of law that, where the <em>failure of a contractor to complete the work by the specified
                            day</em> has been brought about by the act of the other party to
                        the contract, he is exonerated from the performance of the contract by that
                        date, which has been thus rendered impossible. That rule appears to me to be
                        applicable to the present case. It has often been laid down that, where
                        there is a provision that a contractor shall pay penalties <em>for delay</em> as in the present case, no penalty can be
                        recovered <em>where delay has been occasioned by the act of
                            the person</em> endeavouring to enforce the penalties ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Chitty LJ expressed the same opinion (at
                    568):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law on the subject is well settled. ... This principle is applicable
                        not to building contracts only, but to all contracts. If a man agrees to do
                        something by a particular day or in default to pay a sum of money as
                        liquidated damages, the other party to the contract <em>must
                            not do anything to prevent him from doing the thing contracted for
                            within the specified time</em>. Of course a man may make such a
                        contract as was alleged in <em>Jones</em> v. <em>St John’s College</em>... [However,] it would
                        require very clear language to shew that a man had undertaken a
                        responsibility which very few men would undertake with their eyes open
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     All the leading cases have expressly
                    reiterated the requirement that the delay must result in delayed completion of
                    the works. In <em>Holme and another v Guppy and
                        another</em> (1838) 150 ER 1195; 3 M&amp;W 387 at
                    389, Parke B (delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer) stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear, from the terms of the agreement, that the plaintiffs
                        undertake that they will complete the work in a given four months and a
                        half; and the particular time is extremely material, because they probably
                        would not have entered into the contract unless they had had those four
                        months and a half, within which they could work a greater number of hours a
                        day. Then it appears that they were disabled from by the act of the
                        defendants from the performance of that contract; and there are clear
                        authorities, that if the party be prevented, by the refusal of the other
                        contracting party, <em>from completing the contract within
                            the time limited</em>, he is not liable in law for the default (1
                        Roll. Abr. 543; Com. Dig. Condition, L. (6)) ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A fuller quote from Lord Esher MR’s
                    judgment in <em>Dodd v Churton</em> makes this point clear
                    (at 566):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle is laid down in Comyns' Digest, Condition L(6.), that,
                            <em>where one party to a contract is prevented from
                            performing it by the act of the other, he is not liable in law for that
                            default</em>; and, accordingly, a well recognised rule has been
                        established in cases of this kind, beginning with <em>Holme v
                            Guppy</em>, to the effect that, if the building owner has ordered
                        extra work beyond that specified by the original contract which <em>has necessarily increased the time requisite for finishing the
                            work</em>, he is thereby disentitled to claim the penalties for
                        non-completion provided by the contract. The reason for that rule is that
                        otherwise a most unreasonable burden would be imposed upon the Contractor
                        ...</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Peak Construction

                    1 BLR 114 at 121 (“<em>Peak v
                        McKinney</em>”), which is a case cited by LCS in support of its
                    appeal, Salmon LJ states quite clearly that time will be set at large only
                    where there is a delay in completion:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the <em>failure to complete on time</em> is due to
                        the fault of both the employer and the contractor, in my view, the clause
                        does not bite. I cannot see how, in the ordinary course, the employer can
                        insist on compliance with a condition if it is partly his own fault that it
                        cannot be fulfilled: ... <em>Holme v Guppy</em>. I
                        consider that unless the contract expresses a contrary intention, the
                        employer, in the circumstances postulated, is left to his ordinary remedy;
                        that is to say, to recover such damages as he can prove flow from the
                        contractors’ breach. No doubt if the extension of time clause provided
                        for a postponement of the completion date on account of delay caused by some
                        breach or fault on the part of the employer, the position would be
                        different. This would mean that the parties had intended that the employer
                        could recover liquidated damages notwithstanding that he was <em>partly to blame for the failure to achieve the completion
                            date</em>. In such a case the architect would extend the date for
                        completion, and the contractor would then be liable to pay liquidated
                        damages for delay as from the extended completion date. ... If the employer
                        wishes to recover liquidated damages for <em>failure by the
                            contractors to complete on time</em> in spite of the fact that
                        some of the delay is due to the employers' own fault or breach of contract,
                        then the extension of time clause should provide, expressly or by necessary
                        inference, for an extension on account of such fault or breach on the part
                        of the employer.</p>

                    Fraser of Tullybelton (with whom the four other Law Lords agreed) provided a
                    clear exposition of the applicable principles:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The true position is, I think, correctly stated in the following
                        propositions ... :</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>The general rule</em> is
                            that the main contractor is bound to complete the work by the date for
                            completion stated in the contract. If he fails to do so, he will be
                            liable for liquidated damages to the employer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That is subject to the exception that the employer
                            is not entitled to liquidated damages if by his acts or omissions he has
                            prevented the main contractor from <em>completing his
                                work by [the] completion date</em>: see for example <em>Holme</em> v. <em>Guppy</em>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Lord Fraser made it quite clear, therefore,
                    that if no delay in completion is proven, the general rule applies and time is
                    not set at large. The reason for the consistent affirmation of the requirement
                    that there must be a failure to complete by the specified date is evident. While
                    the principle of time being set at large originated in the idea that liquidated
                    damages for delay <em>in completion</em> should not be
                    imposed where the person claiming those damages contributed to that delay, there
                    is no reason to extend that principle to situations where there is a mere delay
                    in the progress of the works which cannot, by definition, give rise to a claim
                    to or deduction of liquidated damages. In claiming or deducting liquidated
                    damages, the employer would not be taking advantage of his own wrong because his
                    conduct was not proven to have caused completion of the works to be
                    delayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As a matter of principle, the unanimous weight
                    of academic commentary leans heavily in favour of the proposition that a delay
                    in completion of the works must be shown. In Stephen Furst QC &amp; Sir Vivian
                    Ramsey, <em>Keating on Construction Contracts</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 2006, 8<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Keating</em>”), the following statement was made (at
                    para 9-018):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the employer prevents <em>the completion</em> of
                        the works in any way ... the general rule is that he <em>loses the right to claim liquidated damages for
                            non-completion</em> to time, for he “cannot insist on
                            <em>a condition</em> if it is his own fault that
                            <em>the condition</em> has not been
                        fulfilled”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar statement was made in Nicholas Dennys QC, Mark Raeside QC
                    &amp; Robert Clay, <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010,

                        time mechanism. This can happen where... the Employer has in one way or
                        another prevented <em>completion</em> within the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The requirement that there must be a delay to
                    completion of the works was also reiterated in Keith Pickavance<em>, Delay and Disruption in Construction Contracts</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 2010, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed) (“<em>Pickavance</em>”) at para 6-120:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, therefore, where there is a contractually binding date for
                        completion but, for reasons within [the contractor’s] control [the
                        sub-contractor] is <em>prevented from completing</em>
                        by the contract completion date, [the contractor] can no longer insist upon
                        completion by the due date and must then complete within a reasonable period
                        as a result of the effect of what is known as the “prevention
                        principle”. Although there appears to be no US case law on the point,
                        this equitable remedy is familiar to most common law countries, and it is a
                        remedy that is encapsulated in art.7.1.2 of the <em>Unidroit
                            Principles of International Commercial Contracts</em> (2004) and
                        in some civil law codes.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     
          <em>Sonny Yap</em> was a
                    case in which the conduct of the employer was the main cause of the inability of
                    the contractor to <em>complete</em> the works by the
                    stipulated date. Also, Chow Kok Fong, <em>Law and Practice of
                        Construction Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2004) (“<em>Chow
                        Kok Fong</em>”) at p 401 provides no support for LCS’s
                    contention because it is clear that, read in context, it states that only a
                    delay in completion of the works will suffice to set time at large:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he contractor’s <em>obligation to complete the
                            works</em> under a construction contract within a prescribed
                        period of time <em>is premised on the requirement that he is
                            not delayed</em> by reason of any “act of
                        prevention” committed by either the employer or his agents. An act of
                        prevention operates to prevent, impede or otherwise make it more difficult
                        for a contractor <em>to complete</em> the works by the
                        date stipulated in the contract ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Furthermore, the distinction between, on the
                    one hand, a delay in progress which does not constitute an act of prevention and
                    therefore does not set time at large, and, on the other hand, a delay in
                    completion which does constitute an act of prevention, is well-established.
                        <em>Pickavance</em> puts the point in the following way
                    (at paras 6-001 to 6-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A delay, or a likelihood of delay to progress is not the same as a
                        delay, or a likelihood of delay to completion. It is unfortunate that the
                        words are easily connected and, in using them in the same clauses of
                        contracts, the draftsmen have caused much confusion. A delay to progress is
                        an adverse shift in the intended timing of the start and/or finish of a
                        discrete activity; it can occur at any time. ... On the other hand, a delay
                        to the completion date occurs only when the completion date has passed and
                        can only be caused by a delay to the progress of an activity which is on the
                        critical path to completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... For example: if an event that causes 50 days’ delay to progress
                        in an activity impacts upon an activity that has 15 days’ total float,
                        it will demonstrate that the event will absorb the 15 days of float and,
                        after the float has been taken up, the event will be likely to cause only 35
                        days’ delay to the completion date (not withstanding that it caused 50
                        days’ delay to progress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A similar explanation was provided in
                        <em>Hudson</em> (at para 6-068):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [E]vents which may give rise to ... interference with progress... fall
                        into two broad categories: those which amount to a breach of contract by the
                        Employer and those events which are authorised by the contract, but
                        nonetheless affect progress. ... The consequence of the event may be delay
                        to a single activity or to a number of the activities which are dependent
                        for their progress on the activity which has been delayed. Whether the
                        activity will cause delay to the completion date for the whole of the work
                        contracted for will depend on the relationship between the activity delayed
                        and subsequent activities which cannot be carried out or completed until the
                        activity has been completed... [S]uch a delay involves the activity being
                        critical, i.e. on the critical path for the project. This expression itself
                        may be ambiguous because there are activities which are physically linked in
                        the sense that one must complete before the other can start (sometimes
                        referred to as construction links), and activities which are linked in the
                        Contractor’s programme because that represents the sequence which
                        reflects the way in which the Contractor intends to use their resources
                        (resource links). The former (construction) links cannot be
                        “broken” as they are part of the inherent logic of any
                        programme. The latter (resource) links can be changed, but may involve some
                        additional expense for the Contractor. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Apart from <em>Sonny
                        Yap</em>, LCS cites several other cases in support of its appeal.
                        <em>Peak v McKinney</em> has already been considered.
                    Although the New Zealand case of <em>Fernbrook Trading Co Ltd v
                        Taggart</em> [1979] 1 NZLR 556 does not expressly state
                    whether the delay was one which affected completion, it is likely that the delay
                    was in fact one which affected completion, because it concerned a delay of 23
                    weeks in making progress payments and a failure to issue progress payment
                    certificates in five separate months. Furthermore, all the cases cited in the
                    judgment concerned a delayed completion date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     LCS also cites two local cases: <em>Kwang In Tong Chinese Temple v Fong Choon Hung Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 907 at [18] (“<em>Kwang In
                    Tong</em>”) and <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v
                        Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 518 at
                        [18]. In the first case, the judge
                    appeared to accept that there was a delay in the completion of the works. The
                    second case is unclear as to whether there was delay in the completion of the
                    works. The passage cited from the judgment merely reiterates that time will be
                    set at large where there is “any prevention by the employer of the
                    contractor’s performance of the contract”. In light of the
                    overwhelming weight of authority and academic opinion, the judge must have meant
                    a prevention of completion on time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In essence, an employer’s conduct will
                    set time at large only if a threshold is met: it must cause a delay in the
                    completion of the works. Because the Arbitrator found that LW’s breaches
                    of contract had not been proved to meet this threshold, LCS’s remedy lies
                    in damages for disruption of its progress (in which case it will have to prove
                    its loss to obtain more than nominal damages). Given the availability of a
                    remedy in damages, LCS’s contention that LW would be taking advantage of
                    its own wrong appears to be misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     LCS’s final argument is that if there is
                    a question as to which party should bear the risk of time being set at large as
                    a consequence of acts of prevention, the obvious answer should be LW. First, it
                    was LW which committed the acts of prevention. Secondly, LW could have, from the
                    outset, prevented time from being set at large by expressly providing for an
                    extension of time in the event that such acts of prevention caused delay. LCS
                    relies on the following passage in <em>Peak v McKinney</em>
                    (at 121):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If the employer wishes to recover liquidated damages for failure by
                        the contractors to complete on time in spite of the fact that some of the
                        delay is due to the employers’ own fault or breach of contract, then
                        the extension of time clauses should provide, expressly or by necessary
                        inference, for an extension on account of such a fault or breach on the part
                        of the employer ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It also relies on <em>dicta</em> in <em>Kwang In Tong</em> (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Such a result (time set at large) can be prevented by providing in the
                        contract for extensions of time in the event of the employer’s acts or
                        omissions affecting the progress of the works, and by the actual grant of
                        extensions of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I reject this argument because it presupposes
                    that time will in fact be set at large even if there is only a delay in
                    progress. I have held that this is not the case. A contractor should not be held
                    legally responsible for failure to protect itself from an eventuality which may
                    never occur. In any event, the question of the allocation of risk is almost
                    invariably a question of contractual interpretation and is not one which is left
                    to the court’s discretion. The courts have adopted a common-sense approach
                    and have <em>presumed</em> that the parties have intended
                    that liquidated damages should not be available if the person claiming it has
                    contributed to the delay in completion of the works. For this reason, it is
                    well-settled that if a contract clearly provides that the date of completion
                    will not be set at large even if the completion date of the works is delayed,
                    this bargain will be upheld by the courts: <em>Jones and another
                        v The President and Scholars of St John’s College, Oxford</em>
                    (1870-71) LR 6 QB 115; <em>Dodd v
                        Churton</em> at 568. This may occur, for instance, where the contract
                    clearly obliges the contractor to complete the works within the stipulated time
                    even if extras are ordered and no extension of time is granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">LW’s alternative arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     LW also advances three other arguments to
                    resist LCS’s appeal on the first question of law. As I have concluded that
                    LCS’s appeal on the first question of law should fail, it is strictly
                    unnecessary to deal with these arguments. One of the arguments raised involves
                    an important point of principle, however, and may therefore merit further
                    discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     LW argues that LCS is precluded from bringing
                    the appeal on the first question of law because the latter had pleaded in the
                    Arbitration that there was delay in completion but had failed to prove this.
                    Furthermore, during the Arbitration LCS had agreed with LW that “Issue
                    10” – whether time for completion was set at large – would
                    only need to be decided by the Arbitrator if “Issue 9” –
                    whether there was delay in <em>completion</em> – was
                    answered in the affirmative. During the hearing on 8 February 2011, this
                    argument was refined by LW’s counsel. He argued that because the issue was
                    pleaded and put to the Arbitrator in that particular way, the Arbitrator had not
                    made an error of law which was amenable to an appeal on a question of law
                    arising out of an arbitral award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     LCS argues that there was no such agreement
                    between the parties as to the issues to be submitted to the Arbitrator. This
                    contention is unsustainable in light of the evidence: first, a letter on
                    3 July 2009 from the Arbitrator to the parties set out a list of issues,
                    including Issues 9 and 10, “to be determined” in the arbitration,
                    and second, this list was drawn up “by agreement of solicitors for the
                    parties”. A subsequent exchange of emails between the parties did not
                    show that there was any objection to the list of issues or to the assertion that
                    it was agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is true that the Arbitrator was only asked
                    to decide (a) whether there was delay in the completion of the works (Issue 9),
                    and (b) if so, whether time was set at large (Issue 10). However, it is clear
                    that, in arriving at the conclusion on Issue 10 that time was not set at large,
                    the Arbitrator held that the proof of delay to progress of the works was in
                    itself insufficient to set time at large without further proof of a knock-on
                    delay in completion. In essence, LW’s contention is that a question of law
                    which is open to appeal under s 49 of the Act is limited to the precise issues
                    which are pleaded before the arbitrator and nothing more, even if the question
                    of law arises out of a finding which was a necessary step along the path to the
                    arbitrator’s ultimate conclusion on the pleaded issues. LW provided no
                    authority for this contention. The leading case of <em>Northern
                        Elevator Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Northern Elevator</em>”), in which the Court of Appeal dealt
                    with the scope of the equivalent provision under the now-repealed Arbitration
                    Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed), does not contemplate such a limited scope for the
                    operation of what is now s 49:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Section 28 of the
                            Act confers upon the High Court a power to grant leave to appeal against
                            an arbitration award if there is a “question of law”,
                            arising from the award, to be determined. As a preliminary point, it is
                            essential to delineate between a “question of law” and an
                            “error of law”, for the former confers jurisdiction on a
                            court to grant leave to appeal against an arbitration award while the
                            latter, in itself, does not.</p>

                            at [7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…
                            <em>A question of law means a point of law in controversy
                                which has to be resolved after opposing views and arguments have
                                been considered. It is a matter of substance the determination of
                                which will decide the rights between the parties</em>.
                            … If the point of law is settled and not something novel and it
                            is contended that the arbitrator made an error in the application of the
                            law there lies no appeal against that error for there is no question of
                            law which calls for an opinion of the court. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    To our mind, a “question of law” must
                            necessarily be a finding of law which the parties dispute, that requires
                            the guidance of the court to resolve. When an arbitrator does not apply
                            a principle of law correctly, that failure is a mere “error of
                            law” (but more explicitly, an erroneous application of law) which
                            does not entitle an aggrieved party to appeal.</p>

          <em>Northern
                        Elevator</em> distinguishes between, on the one hand, an erroneous
                    identification of the correct legal principles (or, in other words, an
                    identification of the wrong legal principles), and, on the other hand, the
                    erroneous application of the correct legal principles: only the former will
                    qualify as a proper “question of law” within s 49(1). There
                    is nothing in <em>Northern Elevator</em> which obliges the
                    court further to limit the meaning of “question of law” to the
                    precise issues which were pleaded before the arbitrator. In reaching a
                    conclusion on a pleaded issue, an arbitrator may make several findings along the
                    way, whether of fact or of law (as properly understood). If he makes a finding
                    of law which is necessary to enable him to reach the ultimate conclusion on the
                    precise issue which was pleaded, there seems to be no reason why that finding
                    should not fall within the meaning of a “question of law” in s
                    49(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I reject LCS’s argument that time may be
                    set at large if there is no delay in the completion date but merely a delay in
                    progress. Thus, the answer to the first question of law is
                    “Yes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     According to s 49(1) of the Act, a party to
                    arbitration proceedings may appeal “on a question of law arising out of
                    an award made in the proceedings.” In light of the fact that both parties
                    had contractually agreed in Art 5.5 of the sub-contract that appeals to the
                    court on questions of law may be brought, the second and third questions of law
                    raise the interesting issue of whether the mere fact that the parties have
                    agreed that appeals on questions of law may be brought has the effect of
                    precluding the need to characterise the questions to ensure that they are
                    questions of law arising out of the award. In this particular case, Art 5.5 does
                    not contemplate this result because it simply refers to appeals “on any
                    question of law arising out of an award”, without more. As a matter of
                    common-sense, this clause does not purport to preclude the necessity of
                    characterisation; indeed, such characterisation would be even more essential
                    because Art 5.5 confines the scope of the parties’ agreement to appeals on
                    “any question of law arising out of an award”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In any event, there is nothing in the wording
                    of s 49(1) which indicates that the parties may alter by agreement the
                    nature of questions which may be referred to the court on appeal. This approach
                    is reinforced by the wording of s 49(2) which is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding subsection (1), the parties may <em>agree
                            to exclude</em> the jurisdiction of the Court under this section
                        and an agreement to dispense with reasons for the arbitral tribunal’s
                        award shall be treated as an agreement to exclude the jurisdiction of the
                        Court under this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In light of that, I am of the opinion that, if there was any purported
                    agreement between the parties to increase the scope of the court’s
                    jurisdiction on appeals pursuant to s 49, it is still necessary to characterise
                    the questions referred to the court to ensure that they truly constitute
                    questions of law arising out of the arbitral award. I note that this approach
                    was also taken by Blair J in <em>Guangzhou Dockyards Co Ltd
                        v ENE Aegiali I</em> [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 30 where the
                    arbitration clause stated that either party may appeal “on <em>any issue</em> arising out of any award” and one party
                    attempted to appeal on what it admitted to be questions of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Thus, it is necessary to characterise the
                    second question of law. It is as follows: given that time has been set at large,
                    whether LW could exercise its contractual right to terminate under cl 27.1 and,
                    if so, whether it could only do so by reference to a reasonable time for
                    completion of the works. LW submits that because the appeal on this question of
                    law is premised on time having been set at large, it should be dismissed if
                    LCS’s appeal on the first question of law fails. I agree. As I have
                    dismissed LCS’s appeal on the first question of law, I also dismiss its
                    appeal on this question of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Even if I was wrong to have dismissed
                    LCS’s appeal on the first question of law, I hold that the appeal on the
                    second question of law should be dismissed because s 49(1) requires that the
                    question of law must be one “arising out of an award made in the
                    proceedings”. The Arbitrator held that time was <em>not</em> set at large; therefore, this question of law could not have
                    arisen out of the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     
          <em>Northern
                        Elevator</em> draws a distinction between, on the one hand, an
                    erroneous identification of legal principles (<em>eg</em>,
                    the interpretation of cl 27.1 or the identification of the common law principles
                    of termination) which is open to appeal under s 49(1), and, on the other hand,
                    an erroneous application of the correct legal principles to the facts which is
                    not amenable to appeal. A question of contractual interpretation is in principle
                    a question of law which the court has jurisdiction to determine: see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Pioneer Shipping Ltd and others v
                        BTP Tioxide Ltd</em> [1982] AC 724 at 736A-G (“<em>The Nema</em>”), <em>Permasteelisa
                        Pacific Holdings Ltd v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co
                        Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 270 at [10], <em>Holland Leedon Pte Ltd (in liquidation)
                        v Metalform Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 517 at [11]. This approach is consistent with the
                    legislative intent which underpins s 49 of the Act. In 1997, the
                    Attorney-General set up a committee to review the arbitration legislation in
                    Singapore. In 2000, it published its final report, <em>Review of
                        Arbitration Laws</em>, <em>LRRD No 3/2001</em>
                    (“the Report”) as well as the draft Arbitration Bill 2001. Section
                    2.38.1 of the Report states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Retaining a limited degree of review by the court is consistent with the
                        parties’ desire <em>to have the matter decided in
                            accordance with the law as properly understood and as applied in
                            Singapore</em>. The right of appeal against awards on questions of
                        law is thus retained in this Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It would be odd if questions of contractual
                    interpretation, <em>ie</em>, of the meaning of particular
                    contractual terms, are not questions of law which are amenable to appeal
                    pursuant to s 49. Given that the obligations of contracting parties are
                    generally governed by the terms of the contract, whether express or implied,
                    party autonomy would be unduly infringed if the mere fact that an arbitrator had
                    identified the correct principles of contractual interpretation (at a more
                    general level) would prevent an appeal pursuant to s 49 if he had nonetheless
                    failed to <em>apply</em> them correctly to ascertain the
                        <em>more specific</em> obligations arising out of the
                    contract. These more specific obligations, <em>eg</em>,
                    whether a particular event qualifies for extension of time under an extension of
                    time clause, will invariably be viewed as being far more practically important
                    by contracting parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the present appeal, the Arbitrator did not
                    have the opportunity of deciding the effect of time being set at large on
                    LW’s right to terminate the sub-contract, whether pursuant to cl 27.1 or
                    relying on its common law remedies, for the simple reason that he found that
                    time was <em>not</em> set at large. I would not be in a
                    position to decide this appeal without having the benefit of the
                    Arbitrator’s findings to determine whether the hypothetical error raises a
                    question which is amenable to appeal under s 49(1), <em>ie</em>, whether or not the second question, <em>if</em> answered by the Arbitrator, would have raised an issue of
                    contractual interpretation or merely one of the application of the law (as
                    correctly determined) to the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third question of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This question of law is as follows: given that
                    time has been set at large, whether LW was entitled under cl 27.4 to claim the
                    costs incurred in engaging other sub-contractors to carry out the sub-contract
                    works. I hold that this appeal should be dismissed for the same reasons as the
                    appeal on the second question of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For the reasons given above, this appeal fails
                    and must be dismissed with costs.</p>
