<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the prosecution against
                    the sentences imposed by the District Judge (“the DJ”) on the
                    respondent for three offences for which he was convicted on 19 May
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first charge, DAC 40614/2008, was for
                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a three-year-old boy (“the
                    child”) on 14 January 2008, punishable under s 325 of the Penal
                    Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), by causing the child to sustain head
                    injury of intracranial haemorrhage which endangered his life. In fact, the child
                    died from this injury. Prior to the 2007 amendments to the Penal Code which came
                    into effect on 1 February 2008 (<em>ie</em>, after the
                    date of the offence), the prescribed punishment for this offence was
                    imprisonment for a term which might extend to seven years and a fine or
                    caning. The respondent was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and
                    12 strokes of the cane on this charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The second charge, DAC 40615/2008, was for
                    ill-treating the child by punching the child in the head with great force on
                    12 January 2008, an offence under s 5(1) of the Children and Young
                    Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the CYPA”) and punishable
                    under s 5(5)(<em>b</em>) of the same. The prescribed
                    punishment for this offence was a fine of up to $4,000 or imprisonment for a
                    term not exceeding four years or to both. The respondent was sentenced to
                    one year’s imprisonment on this charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The third charge, DAC 40616/2008, was also under
                    s 5(1) of the CYPA and punishable under s 5(5)(<em>b</em>) of the same, and was for ill-treating the child by grabbing,
                    shaking and biting the child’s penis and scrotum on 14 January 2008.
                    The respondent was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for this
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The DJ ordered the sentences for the first and
                    third charges to run concurrently but the sentence for the second charge to run
                    consecutively. Thus, in total, the respondent was sentenced to seven
                    years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The prosecution was
                    dissatisfied with the sentences imposed and appealed on the ground that they
                    were manifestly inadequate. I allowed the appeal in part on 6 October 2009
                    and now give my reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The respondent was a 27-year-old Singapore
                    citizen with no prior criminal record. The child was born on 14 January
                    2005. His biological father abandoned the family sometime in May 2007. At the
                    time of the offences, the child was living with his mother and the respondent,
                    with whom his mother had a relationship. His mother was undergoing divorce
                    proceedings with the child’s biological father, and the respondent had
                    agreed to be the child’s stepfather pending the divorce. Whenever the
                    child’s mother was not around, it was the respondent who was in charge of
                    taking care of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the child’s mother, the
                    respondent’s relationship with the child was initially warm, but this
                    changed after the respondent grew increasingly jealous of the mother’s
                    attention towards the child. She testified that she noticed a scar on the
                    child’s forehead in December 2007, which the respondent claimed the child
                    sustained from a fall whilst running about. She also testified that the
                    respondent bit the child on his right shoulder in December 2007, but claimed
                    that it was only a “biting game” they had been playing when she
                    confronted him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The circumstances of the offences were gleaned
                    from the respondent’s statements to the police. After an initial challenge
                    to the statements through a trial within a trial, the DJ admitted the statements
                    and recorded the following facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 12 January 2008, the respondent was
                    asked by the child’s mother to clean the child’s diapers after he
                    had soiled himself. After the washing, the respondent asked the child to walk
                    out of the bathroom so that the respondent could dry him off with a towel. The
                    child started to cry but stopped after being told to keep quiet by the
                    respondent. However, the child resumed crying again in the midst of being dried
                    off. This time, the respondent’s efforts at pacifying the child failed,
                    and he punched the child on the back of his head in a fit of anger. These
                    actions formed the basis of the second charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 14 January 2008 at about 7.30am, the
                    child’s mother left home to attend to her divorce proceedings at the
                    Syariah Court. The child started crying when he saw his mother preparing to
                    leave the house. His mother tried to pacify him by asking him to give her a
                    kiss and hug. He kissed and hugged her once before she left (she testified
                    that there were no injuries on the child at the time). The child continued
                    crying for another five minutes after she had left the flat before eventually
                    stopping. The respondent went back to sleep. Shortly after, the child tapped the
                    respondent on the shoulder and asked to play with his toys. The respondent
                    nodded in reply and the child went to the bedroom with his toys while the
                    respondent went back to sleep in the living room. About 15 minutes later,
                    the child came out from the bedroom, resumed crying incessantly and called out
                    for “Mummy”. The respondent tried to comfort the child by giving
                    him a hug but was rebuffed. The child stamped his feet and continued calling for
                    “Mummy”. The respondent asked the child if he wanted milk or
                    water, but the child did not respond and continued stamping his feet. The
                    respondent went to the kitchen and handed a bottle of water to the child who
                    pushed it away. Following this, the respondent also tried switching on the
                    television and playing music from the child’s “Barney CD” in
                    an effort to placate him, but to no avail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The respondent finally gave up and began
                    preparing his breakfast of fried rice. Midway through his preparations, the
                    respondent shouted at the child and told him to go play with his toys. The child
                    went inside the bedroom and played with his toys while continuing to cry. At
                    this time, the respondent had a stomach ache and he stopped cooking. After he
                    came out of the toilet, the respondent sat in front of the television in an
                    effort to “cool [himself] down”. Within a few minutes, however,
                    the respondent went inside the bedroom, grabbed the child, and shouted at him in
                    Malay, asking him why he was so naughty. He then pointed the child towards a
                    wall, which he previously ordered the child to stand in front of as a form of
                    punishment for misbehaviour. The child cried even louder, and the respondent hit
                    the child on his hand using his finger, at the same time shouting
                    “Diam” at him. The respondent then started slapping the child
                    using his right hand, all the while shouting “Diam”. When the
                    child did not stop crying, the respondent threw four or five punches at the
                    child’s face and forehead and jabbed upwards at the child’s chin,
                    before grabbing the child by the mouth with his right hand and holding onto the
                    child’s shoulder with his left hand, lifting him off the ground and
                    slamming him into the wall next to the bedroom doorframe. He did not stop after
                    slamming the child, but carried on slapping the child on his back, at which
                    point the child stopped crying. These actions formed the basis of the first
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After this series of events, the respondent
                    pulled down the child’s shorts inside the bedroom and opened the top of
                    the child’s diapers. He then grabbed the child’s penis and shook it
                    violently before squeezing it. He continued to pinch and pull the child’s
                    penis before lifting the child and biting him on his right thigh. He proceeded
                    to bite the child’s penis, scrotum, stomach and nose. The respondent
                    admitted to biting the child’s penis several times. The shaking, grabbing
                    and biting of the child’s genitalia formed the basis of the third
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After these assaults on the child, the
                    respondent found the child pale and unresponsive. He looked for help and carried
                    the child out to a neighbour’s flat. The respondent said the child had
                    stopped breathing at this time. An ambulance was called and the victim was sent
                    to the Kandang Kerbau Women’s and Children’s Hospital. One of the
                    paramedics who answered the call testified that the respondent had his right
                    palm over the child’s chest and was blowing air into the child’s
                    mouth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At about 11.36am on the same day,
                    Dr Janil Puthucheary attended to the child and found multiple injuries of
                    various ages – on the face, head, trunk, limbs, abdomen, genitalia and the
                    back. The child underwent emergency surgery. On 18 January 2008, the child
                    died. The autopsy conducted on 19 January 2008 showed a total of 31
                    injuries, including injuries on the child’s head, upper limbs, anterior
                    trunk, back, pubic region and genitalia, and lower limbs. The primary cause of
                    death was established to be from the head injuries suffered by the child,
                    leading to bleeding over the surface of the brain, <em>ie</em>, intracranial haemorrhage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After a trial lasting eight days, the DJ
                    convicted the respondent of all three charges. The DJ agreed with the
                    prosecution’s submission that the overriding sentencing imperative in this
                    case was of deterrence, both specifically to prevent the respondent from
                    re-offending and in general to send a strong and clear message to the public
                    against the mistreatment of young children. After considering the sentencing
                    precedents cited by the prosecution for offences punishable under ss 325
                    and 326 of the Penal Code (see below at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>), the DJ held that the present case of causing grievous hurt
                    was of a more serious nature and sentenced the respondent to
                    six years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the first
                    charge. However, no sentencing precedent was cited by the prosecution for the
                    CYPA offences, and the DJ took into account precedents from <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis,
                    2nd Ed, 2003) at pp 122–124. He then sentenced the respondent to
                    one year’s imprisonment for each of the second and third charges. Finally,
                    the DJ ordered that the sentences for the first and third charges were to run
                    concurrently because he regarded the offences to be committed at the same time
                    and therefore fell within the ‘one transaction’ rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The prosecution appealed on the ground that
                    the aggregate sentence for the three offences was manifestly inadequate. The
                    prosecution submitted that the maximum penalty should have been imposed for each
                    of the charges, and that the sentences should run consecutively instead of
                    concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriateness of imposing the maximum penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The principle for imposing the maximum
                    prescribed punishment for any offence is clear. It is only warranted when the
                    particular crime belongs to the most serious category of cases under that
                    offence, although it need not be restricted to the ‘worst case
                    imaginable’: see <em>Sim Gek Yong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at 542, [13] and
                        <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 where the court stated at [84]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By imposing a sentence close to or fixed at the statutory maximum, a court
                        calibrates the offender’s conduct as among the worst conceivable for
                        that offence. In other words, when Parliament sets a statutory maximum, it
                        signals the gravity with which the public, through Parliament, views that
                        particular offence: <em>Cheong Siat Fong v PP</em>
                        [2005] SGHC 176 at [23]; <em>R v H</em> (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65.
                        Therefore, it stands to reason that sentencing judges must take note of the
                        maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the
                        offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by
                        Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, even if the conduct in a particular case could have been
                    exacerbated in some way, the maximum penalty is still appropriate where the
                    conduct could be objectively characterized as belonging to the worst end of the
                    scale when comparing instances of that offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Death, it goes without saying, is generally
                    the most serious consequence of any offence and may warrant the imposition of a
                    maximum sentence: see, for instance, <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Fazely bin Rahmat and another</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 184,
                    where the (then) maximum sentence under s 325 of the Penal Code of
                    seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was imposed
                    for each of the two offenders convicted of causing grievous hurt to a victim for
                    an assault (together with other gang members) on the victim which lead to his
                    death. But the consequence of death alone would not attract the maximum sentence
                    without more. Factors such as the manner in which the death was caused, the
                    relationship between the offender and the victim, the offender’s state of
                    mind or the offender’s motives would also go towards the weighing of
                    whether this particular instance fell within the worst category of cases for the
                    offence in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Separately, the gravity of the offence would
                    be increased in cases involving vulnerable victims. Children and young persons
                    are particularly vulnerable because they are unable to fend for themselves and
                    require their parents or guardians to take care of them. Any person entrusted
                    with the care of young children would be harshly dealt with if that trust is
                    betrayed: see <em>Purwanti Parji v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2005] 2 SLR(R) 220 at [30] and <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Teo Chee Seng</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 250 at [9].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first charge – voluntarily causing grievous hurt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In relation to the first charge for
                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the DJ considered several cases under
                    s 325 of the Penal Code involving similar facts. First, the case of
                        <em>Yap Seow Cheng v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2002] SGDC 261 (“<em>Yap Seow
                    Cheng</em>”), where the father of a three-month-old boy pleaded
                    guilty to assaulting his son in a fit of anger when he could not stop crying.
                    The offender slapped the victim repeatedly on both cheeks and also grabbed the
                    victim’s arms, resulting in the victim suffering from moderate to severe
                    neuro-development delay. The offender was sentenced to three years’
                    imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Second, the case of <em>Cindy Chandra v Public Prosecutor</em> (MA 293/1996)
                    (referred to in <em>Yap Seow Cheng</em>), where the mother
                    of a four-year-old girl had pleaded guilty to throwing her daughter onto the
                    concrete floor twice when she found that her daughter had been slow in eating
                    her meal. As a result, the victim became mentally retarded and visually
                    impaired. The offender was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. Third,
                    the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Rosnani bte Ismail</em>
                    (DAC 19936/2000) (“<em>Rosnani</em>”) (also
                    cited by the court in <em>Yap Seow Cheng</em>), in which a
                    mentally retarded mother hit her child with a metal rice pot causing the
                    child’s death. The offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five
                    years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The victim here was a three-year-old child.
                    The respondent had agreed to be the child’s stepfather, <em>ie</em>, he had agreed to be the child’s care-giver and
                    guardian in the absence of the child’s biological father. Indeed, at the
                    time of the offence, the respondent was charged with taking care of the child in
                    the mother’s absence. But, instead of looking after the child, he lost his
                    temper and <em>repeatedly</em> slapped and punched the
                    child in the face before slamming the child’s head into the wall. It was
                    this head injury which led to the intracranial haemorrhage causing the
                    child’s death. Unlike the first two cases discussed above where the young
                    victims survived the assaults, the respondent in this case had caused the death
                    of the child when he should have been caring for his welfare. He had not
                    intended to cause death, but he had intended to cause physical harm to the
                    child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Derek Kang Yu Hsien, counsel for the
                    respondent, argued that the present facts were not so different from the case of
                        <em>Rosnani</em> where the victim had also died and
                    therefore did not warrant the imposition of the maximum sentence. I could not
                    agree. Although the victim in <em>Rosnani</em> was of a
                    similar age and had also died as a result of the assault, the offender in
                        <em>Rosnani</em> was mentally retarded, and,
                    furthermore, she had pleaded guilty upon being charged with the offence. In
                    stark contrast, there were no such mitigating factors present here. There was no
                    evidence that the respondent was in any way mentally retarded. He had claimed
                    trial to the three charges for which he could not possibly have any defence
                    without proving diminished responsibility or insanity. His conduct was some
                    evidence of a lack of remorse for what he had done. The nature of the injuries
                    caused to the child and the circumstances in which they were inflicted put this
                    case, in my opinion, in the worst category of cases of causing grievous
                    hurt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second and third charges – the CYPA offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Turning to the offences under the CYPA, the DJ
                    considered the following precedents. First, in <em>Subagio
                        Soeharto v Public Prosecutor</em> (MA 505/1993), five charges
                    were preferred against the offender, who was the father of both victims. The
                    first victim was less than two years old and was assaulted by the offender
                    on four separate occasions over a period of five months. The second victim was
                    two and a half years old and was assaulted once. Both victims suffered bruises
                    on their thighs, trunks and cheeks. The offender claimed trial and was convicted
                    on all charges. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for each
                    of the charges, which were ordered to run consecutively for a total of 30
                    months’ imprisonment. Second, in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Tan Meow Eng</em> (DAC 25526/1997) (“<em>Tan
                        Meow Eng</em>”), the offender was the mother of the one year
                    and nine months old victim. When the family went on a six-day holiday, the
                    offender continually beat the victim on his legs whenever he cried, refused to
                    sleep, or was naughty. She also allowed her boyfriend to administer sleeping
                    pills to the victim and failed to provide him with enough food. The offender
                    pleaded guilty to one charge of ill-treatment under the CYPA and was sentenced
                    to 15 months’ imprisonment. Third, in <em>Mohd
                        Iskandar bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> (MA 187/1998)
                        (“<em>Mohd Iskandar bin Abdullah</em>”),
                    the offender was the father of both victims. He punched the first victim on his
                    cheeks, and beat the second victim with his belt buckle until the belt buckle
                    broke off. He also kicked the second victim in the head causing him to lose
                    consciousness temporarily. The offender pleaded guilty to two charges, and
                    three other charges were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to
                    18 months’ imprisonment for each charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, I agreed with
                    Mr Kang that the sentence imposed for the second charge, namely, the
                    respondent’s punching of the child on 12 January 2008, was not
                    manifestly inadequate. The offence constituted a one-off instance of abuse as
                    compared to the series of acts comprising the ill-treatment seen in <em>Tan Meow Eng</em> and <em>Mohd Iskandar bin
                        Abdullah</em> above. Additionally, the injury suffered was not so
                    serious that it could be characterized as belonging to the worst category of
                    offences under s 5(1) of the CYPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, the same could not be said of the
                    third charge, <em>ie</em>, the respondent’s shaking,
                    grabbing and biting of the child’s private parts. While the offence was
                    not carried out over a prolonged period of time and might have been the result
                    of the respondent’s lack of self-control, the fact remained that the
                    respondent engaged in an especially perverse form of child abuse when he did
                    what he did. This particular offence exhibited an extreme degree of perverted
                    violence. A child’s genital area is vastly more vulnerable than say, his
                    arms or his buttocks, and the pain inflicted by his depraved biting of the
                    child’s genitalia would likely be more severe than if another part of the
                    child’s body was bitten. This continued assault on the child’s
                    private parts could not readily be compared to more common forms of violence
                    against children such as caning or beating on the arms, legs, or body. It
                    revealed a senseless brutality which must be punished by a corresponding
                    severity. Thus, it was my view that the third charge should properly be
                    characterized as one of the worst cases of its kind. I therefore increased the
                    sentence imposed for this charge from one year’s imprisonment to four
                    years’ imprisonment instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The ‘one transaction’ rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On appeal, the prosecution did not challenge
                    that the ‘one transaction’ rule was applicable. Instead, the
                    prosecution argued that the rule was not a rigid one and should be ignored in
                    this case due to the gravity of the offences. On the other hand, Mr Kang
                    argued that the offence committed with respect to the third charge was not
                    sufficiently serious to justify a departure from the general principles
                    governing offences in the same transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The ‘one transaction’ rule,
                    together with the totality principle, provides a useful guide for the court to
                    assess whether concurrent or consecutive sentences should be imposed when
                    an offender has done a criminal act or acts which have resulted in a plurality
                    of offences. A related principle that should be borne in mind is where an
                    offender is convicted of various offences arising from what is essentially one
                    incident, his overall sentence should reflect his role and culpability in the
                    incident as a whole<em>. The rationale underpinning these
                        principles is that of proportionality in punishment</em>: see
                        <em>Jeffery bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 414 at [16] and <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Law Aik Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Law Aik Meng</em>”) at [60].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Put simply, the essence of the ‘one
                    transaction’ rule is that where two or more offences are committed in the
                    course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of these offences
                    should be concurrent rather than consecutive (the rule is, however, subject to
                    the qualification in s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) in Singapore). The English Court of Appeal observed in <em>Peter John Kastercum v R</em> (1972) 56 Cr App R 298 at
                    299–300 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here several offences are tried together and arise out of the same
                        transaction, it is a good working rule that the sentences imposed for those
                        offences should be made concurrent. <em>The reason for that
                            is because if a man is charged with several serious offences arising out
                            of the same situation and consecutive sentences are imposed, the total
                            very often proves to be much too great for the incident in question.
                            That is only an ordinary working rule</em>; it is perfectly open
                        to a trial judge in a case such as the present to approach this in one of
                        two ways. If he thinks that the assault on the police officer is really part
                        and parcel of the original offence and is to be treated as an aggravation of
                        the original offence, he can reflect it in the sentence for the original
                        offence. If he does that, it is logical and right that any separate sentence
                        for the assault should be made concurrent. On the other hand, and, as this
                        Court thinks, a better course, in cases where an offender assaults the
                        police in an effort to escape, the sentence for the principal offence can be
                        fixed independently of the assault on the constable, and the assault on the
                        constable can be dealt with by a separate and consecutive sentence.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This approach was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>V Murugesan v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 388 (“<em>Murugesan</em>”)
                    at [34]. In <em>Law Aik Meng</em>, the court also endorsed
                    Prof Andrew Ashworth’s remarks in <em>Sentencing and
                        Criminal Justice</em> (Cambridge University Press,
                        4th<sup> </sup>Ed, 2005) at p 244 that the
                    ‘one transaction’ rule “seems to be little more than a
                    pragmatic device for limiting overall sentences rather than a reflection of a
                    sharp category distinction”, which consequently hindered the definition
                    of what constituted a single transaction (at [56]). In that sense, the rule is
                    really just another way of formulating the totality principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A competing concern is that offenders, in the
                    knowledge that they would not face consecutive sentences, would have no reason
                    to stop and avoid committing a further similar offence that could be classified
                    as part of the same transaction. However, because the rule is not a rigid one,
                    the court may in appropriate circumstances impose consecutive sentences despite
                    the offences forming one transaction: see <em>Murugesan</em> at [33]–[35] and <em>Kanagasuntharam v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 874, in which the Court of Appeal stated that (at
                    [6]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general rule, however, is not an absolute rule. The English courts
                        have recognized that there are situations where consecutive sentences are
                        necessary to discourage the type of criminal conduct being punished: see
                            <em>R v Faulkner … , R v
                            Wheatley…</em> and <em>R v
                            Skinner…</em> . The applicability of the exception is said
                        to depend on the facts of the case and the circumstances of the offence. It
                        is stated in broad and general terms and although it may be criticized as
                        vague, it is necessarily in such terms in order that the sentencer may
                        impose an appropriate sentence in each particular case upon each particular
                        offender at the particular time the case is heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As was acknowledged in <em>Law
                        Aik Meng</em>, the difficulty arises in defining what exactly
                    constitutes a single transaction. The court there took the general approach of
                    considering proximity in time and proximity in type of offence to determine if
                    the offences formed a single transaction (citing with approval Prof Ashworth in
                        <em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em> at p 245
                    and also Dr D A Thomas in <em>Principles of
                        Sentencing</em> (Heinemann, 2nd<sup> </sup>Ed,
                    1979) at p 54). Earlier, the Court of Appeal in <em>Tse Po
                        Chung Nathan and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993]
                    1 SLR(R) 308 at [31] had also accepted that factors such as proximity
                    of time, unity of place, unity of purpose or design and continuity of action
                    would determine if offences formed part of the same transaction. The court cited
                    with approval <em>B B Mitra on the Code of Criminal Procedure,
                        1973</em> (Kama Law House, 16th<sup> </sup>Ed,
                    1987) at p 1385 that “[i]t is not the distance nor the proximity of
                    time which is so essential in order to consider what is “the same
                    transaction” as the continuity of action and
                purpose”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Recent case law illustrates the uncertain
                    boundaries of the ‘one transaction’ principle. In <em>Murugesan</em>, the offender had, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, abducted and raped the victim. The Court of Appeal held
                    that “[t]he abduction was for the purposes of having illicit intercourse
                    with the victim and it was really part and parcel of the rape” (at [35]).
                    The court also cited the English Court of Criminal Appeal case of <em>R v Torr</em> [1966] 1 All ER 178 at 180:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s both charges arise out of precisely the same facts and involve, so to
                        speak, exactly the same criminality on the part of the appellant, there was
                        no possible reason for passing consecutive sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the sentences for the rape charge and the abduction
                    charge were ordered to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Similarly, in <em>Mohamad
                        Iskandar bin Basri v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 440 (“<em>Mohamad Iskandar bin
                        Basri</em>”), a fire fighter driving a fire fighting vehicle to
                    the site of a fire failed to stop at a cross junction while the traffic
                    lights were red against him and collided with a taxi, resulting in the death of
                    one of the three passengers in the taxi. He pleaded guilty to three charges:
                    (a) doing a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide by failing to
                    conform to the traffic signal; (b) causing grievous hurt by acting so
                    rashly as to endanger human life; and (c) causing hurt by acting so rashly as to
                    endanger the personal safety of others. The court found that the ‘one
                    transaction’ rule applied because the injuries caused “all stemmed
                    from one act of rashness and not a series of such acts” (at
                    [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On the other hand, in <em>Law
                        Aik Meng</em>, the court found that the ‘one transaction’
                    rule did not apply. In that case, the offender, with his accomplices, had
                    committed theft of cash against a single victim, the Development Bank of
                    Singapore Limited, by stealing from three different automated teller machines
                    across Singapore over a period of five weeks. However, because there was no
                    proximity of time between the various instances of theft, the court ruled that
                    the offences did not form part of the same transaction, although in any case the
                    gravity of the offences involved justified a departure from the rule (at
                    [56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Likewise, in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Lee Cheow Loong Charles</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 961, I held that the mere fact that an accused committed
                    several distinct offences in a short span of time did not mean the ‘one
                    transaction’ rule applied. In that case, the accused had been disqualified
                    from driving. However, in blatant disregard of the ban, the accused drove, in
                    excess of the speed limit, and hit an elderly pedestrian at a signalised
                    crossing. He then drove off without rendering any assistance to her. The accused
                    pleaded guilty to essentially three groups of offences, namely, causing death by
                    a rash act, driving while disqualified, and failing to render assistance after a
                    fatal accident. There, I found that the district judge at trial had implicitly
                    considered the offences to arise from the same transaction, which contributed to
                    the inadequacy of the sentences imposed. On appeal, I held that each of those
                    groups of offences were distinct and separate, both factually and conceptually,
                    from the other groups of offences, because each group was in itself serious, and
                    more importantly did not necessarily or inevitably flow from the other groups of
                    offences (at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>). There was present an
                    element of control with respect to some of the offences which were committed
                    serially and were committed separately from the others. Thus, there was no basis
                    for the application of the ‘one transaction’ rule in such a
                    situation (although the rule would, separately, be applicable to the charge of
                    failing to render assistance and another charge of failing to stop a vehicle
                    after a road traffic accident, which charge was taken into
                    consideration).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The facts of the present appeal do not lend
                    themselves to easy classification. Unlike the situation in <em>Law Aik Meng</em>, there was clearly proximity of time between the
                    conduct forming the first and third charges against the same victim. Indeed,
                    that was the basis of the DJ’s decision to apply the ‘one
                    transaction’ rule. Nonetheless, proximity of time alone would not tie two
                    otherwise distinct offences into one transaction, although I noted that the
                    offences were, in a sense, similar in nature. They were not, however, exactly
                    the same type of behaviour in nature. The series of blows forming the first
                    charge led to the head injuries which endangered the child’s life,
                    eventually leading to his death by intracranial haemorrhage. On the other hand,
                    the second set of blows to the child’s genitalia were separated in time
                    (albeit briefly) as they were perpetrated <em>after</em>
                    the first set of blows, and did not endanger the child’s life although it
                    caused the child extreme pain and trauma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Since the injuries to the child’s
                    genitalia did not cause the child’s death, the respondent’s shaking,
                    grabbing and biting of the child’s genitalia could be said to be distinct
                    and severable from the first charge. But this offence need not have been
                    committed at all if he did not want to commit it This was not a situation where
                    the <em>same set of blows</em> formed the facts behind a
                    charge of causing grievous hurt and a charge of ill-treatment of a child; as
                    contrasted with the situation in <em>Mohamad Iskandar bin
                        Basri</em> where a single rash act formed the basis for three separate
                    offences. Despite the similarity between the first and third charges, they arose
                    from different facts. A further distinction may be drawn with the situation
                    where an offender abducts a victim and then rapes her, such as in <em>Murugesan</em>. There, the abduction was for the purpose of
                    illicit intercourse, and was appropriately characterized by the court as part
                    and parcel of the second offence. Here, the first charge would not seem to be
                    part and parcel of the third charge. The child had stopped crying after being
                    slammed against the wall. The original impetus prompting the respondent’s
                    outrageous outburst was removed, and there was no fresh grievance which could
                    have sparked off the respondent’s rage after the child had stopped crying.
                    At this point, the respondent failed to stop his attack but instead made the
                    decision to remove the child’s shorts and abuse his genitalia. He need not
                    have committed the third offence if he did not want to commit it. The two
                    criminal acts were separate and distinct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Hence, at the moment the respondent failed to
                    stop, his subsequent actions should not be viewed as part of the same set of
                    facts. Characterizing the respondent’s actions as one transaction would
                    also mean a similar offender in the same position would have no incentive to
                    stop an attack on the child, even after endangering the child’s life,
                    because such further attack would not attract a further imprisonment
                    term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For these reasons, I was not convinced that
                    the respondent’s actions in the first and third charges were part of the
                    same transaction. The boundaries of what constitutes one transaction are
                    admittedly difficult to pin down and, as is commonly observed, much would depend
                    on the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences. Ultimately, any
                    analysis must take a commonsensical view as to what forms part of a single
                    transaction. In any case, however, the rule is not absolute. Here, the injuries
                    inflicted by the respondent were numerous, grave and perverse (as the autopsy
                    report shows, 31 injuries were found throughout the child’s body). The
                    respondent’s punch inflicted on 12 January 2008 was not even the
                    first time the respondent had raised his hand against the child, but part of a
                    pattern of abuse. The respondent, who was the victim’s <em>de facto</em> guardian, had used excessive force over a period of
                    time and in a vicious manner on a vulnerable victim who was unable to retaliate
                    or defend himself. His repugnant conduct tragically resulted in the death of an
                    innocent child. This was without doubt one of the worst cases of child abuse in
                    Singapore. Thus, even if the offences may have appeared to be part of the same
                    transaction, I was of the view that the facts of this case called for the
                    imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the circumstances, I allowed the appeal in
                    part and substituted the sentences imposed by the DJ as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     DAC 40614/2008 –
                        seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the
                    cane;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     DAC
                        40615/2008 – one year’s imprisonment;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     DAC 40616/2008
                        – four years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I ordered
                    all three sentences to run consecutively, with the aggregate sentence of
                    12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane to run from
                    the date of remand on 16 January 2008.</p>
