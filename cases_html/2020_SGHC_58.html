</div> When the Defence filed its written closing submissions, it no longer pursued the argument that manual compression of neck was not an injury.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I had two remarks to make in this regard. First, as the submission made in the Defence’s written closing submissions concerned only the fourth element outlined at [35] above, the submission would be dealt with in discussion below on the fourth element. Secondly, as the Defence was no longer arguing that “manual compression of neck” was not an injury, there was strictly no need for me to address the point. Nevertheless, for completeness, I would make the following brief observations. On one level, the phrase “manual compression of neck” could be read as the description of an action – <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the act of compressing someone’s neck with one’s hands. But the term “compression” can also describe a condition of the body, <span class="font-italic">eg,</span> as in “spinal cord compression” or “nerve compression injury”. Thus understood, the phrase “manual compression of neck” would describe the condition of the neck having been compressed by hand. Section 44 of the PC defines “injury” to mean “any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property”. Since the condition of the neck being compressed by hand constitutes harm to the body, manual compression of neck would be an injury for the purpose of the PC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third element: Intention to inflict the bodily injury caused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the question of the accused’s intention, I noted as a preliminary point that the Prosecution submitted that the accused not only intended to cause bodily injury to the deceased by strangling her neck, he also possessed the intention to kill her.

</div> The intention to kill is an element of the offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PC (which is subject to the mandatory death penalty) and not an element of the offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PC (which is punishable by either death or imprisonment for life). Instead, the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for the offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PC is the intention to inflict the bodily injury in question. This meant that evidence of intention to kill would not be directly relevant for determining guilt for the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) offence – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where evidence of the intention to inflict the bodily injury in question is lacking, it would not be open to the court to convict under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) even if there was intention to kill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Having said that, there may be situations where evidence of intention to kill may be of indirect relevance to a charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, as part of the factual background against which the weight and credibility of the evidence of intention to inflict the bodily injury in question could be assessed. In the present case, given the view I had taken of the evidence of intention to inflict the bodily injury in question at [47]–[50] below, it was not necessary for me to have regard to the evidence concerning intention to kill.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Nature of the inquiry for the third element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The nature of the inquiry in respect of the third element was explained in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in these terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9) … when it comes to the question of intention, that is subjective to the offender and it must be proved that he had an intention to cause the bodily injury that is found to be present.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) … if the circumstances justify an inference that a man’s intention was only to inflict a blow on the lower part of the leg, or some lesser blow, and it can be shown that the blow landed in the region of the heart by accident, then, though an injury to the heart is shown to be present, the intention to inflict an injury in that region, or of that nature, is not proved. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(11) In considering whether the intention was to inflict the injury found to have been inflicted, the enquiry necessarily proceeds on broad lines as, for example, whether there was an intention to strike at a vital or a dangerous spot, and whether with sufficient force to cause the kind of injury found to have been inflicted. It is, of course, not necessary to enquire into every last detail as, for instance, whether the prisoner intended to have the bowels fall out, or whether he intended to penetrate the liver or the kidneys or the heart. Otherwise, a man who has no knowledge of anatomy could never be convicted, for, if he does not know that there is a heart or a kidney or bowels, he cannot be said to have intended to injure them. Of course, that is not the kind of enquiry. It is broad-based and simple and based on commonsense: the kind of enquiry that “twelve good men and true” could readily appreciate and understand. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(13) … It does not matter that there was no intention to cause death. It does not matter that there was no intention even to cause an injury of a kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature (not that there is any real distinction between the two). It does not even matter that there is no knowledge that an act of that kind will be likely to cause death. Once the intention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and the only question is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. No one has a licence to run around inflicting injuries that are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and claim that they are not guilty of murder. If they inflict injuries of that kind, they must face the consequences; and they can only escape if it can be shown, or reasonably deduced, that the injury was accidental or otherwise unintentional. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(16) … The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness, or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there. The question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(17) It is true that in a given case the enquiry may be linked up with the seriousness of the injury. For example, if it can be proved, or if the totality of the circumstances justify an inference, that the prisoner only intended a superficial scratch and that by accident his victim stumbled and fell on the sword or spear that was used, then of course the offence is not murder. But that is not because the prisoner did not intend the injury that he intended to inflict to be as serious as it turned out to be but because he did not intend to inflict the injury in question at all.

</div> The accused merely needed to turn around to face the deceased in order to strangle her. However, I did not think this inaccuracy in the 5 April 2016 statement affected the analysis at [47] above. Even if the accused merely needed to turn around to face the deceased (as opposed to walking towards the deceased), the action of turning around could not, in the circumstances, be described as accidental or unintentional. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As for the level of force that the accused intended to apply when tightening the towel around the deceased’s neck, there was no evidence that the accused intended to use less force than he actually did.

</div> In keeping with what was discussed at [45(c)] above, I considered whether this meant that the accused had intended to apply less force than he in fact applied, with the implication that it was only by accident that he ended up applying sufficient force to cause the death of the deceased. I concluded that there was not enough evidence to support such a finding. First, there was simply no explanation from the accused, either in his statements to the police or in his testimony in court that he had intended to use less force than he actually did. Secondly, I was not persuaded by the accused’s assertion that he merely wanted to scare the deceased. Having observed him repeat in court no less than 15 times the constant refrain that he merely wanted to scare the deceased, the assertion sounded rehearsed to me. He had not said once in his police statements or in his interview with the psychiatrist who examined him that he merely wanted to scare the deceased. When given an opportunity to explain in court why he wanted to scare her, the accused was not able to provide an explanation.

As noted at [35] above, the fourth element concerns whether the bodily injury in question is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The bodily injury <span class="font-italic">in question</span> in this context referred to the injury identified from the inquiries undertaken for the first three elements – <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the injury which in fact caused the deceased’s death and which the accused had intended to inflict. Therefore, in order for a question concerning whether an injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death to be relevant to the inquiry for the fourth element, the question must be directed at the injury which in fact caused death and not at any other injury. In the present case, the autopsy report identified manual compression of neck as the injury that caused death. The autopsy report did not state that the internal and external neck injuries listed in para 2.a. or 2.b. were the injuries that caused death. Instead, the autopsy report was clear that those injuries were listed merely as evidence of manual compression of neck. Consequently, the third question in the foregoing exchange had no bearing on the determination of the fourth element. It therefore followed that Dr Chan’s answer to that question similarly had no bearing on the issue. Instead, the correct question to be posed was whether manual compression of neck is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, a question which was posed by the Prosecution to Dr Chan and which Dr Chan answered in the affirmative (see [53(b)] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For the reasons given above, I found the fourth element established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the elements of the s 300(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) offence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Given my finding that each of the four elements of the offence had been established, I concluded that the Prosecution had proven the elements of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether partial defence of grave and sudden provocation made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Exception 1 to s 300 of the PC provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There are two distinct requirements for the defence of provocation to apply (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin </span><span class="font-italic">Johari v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 at [101], citing <span class="font-italic">Seah Kok Meng v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused must have been deprived of self-control by the provocation (“the subjective test”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The provocation must be grave and sudden, and it has to be determined whether an ordinary person of the same sex and age as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked to lose self-control (“the objective test”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The deprivation of self-control at the time of the offence is the crux of the subjective test for making out a defence under Exception 1. This means that there must be no premeditation, calculation or deliberation prior to the killing. The element of loss of self-control does not require that the accused must not have been able to appreciate what he or she was doing. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span><span class="font-italic"> Selvan s/o Sugumaran v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 4 SLR 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39], the loss of self-control varies in intensity and the human mind has several levels and streams of consciousness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As for the objective test, there is no single abstract standard of reasonableness – the conduct of the accused must be assessed by reference to the reasonable person with a broadly similar background: <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>at [51]. The purpose of the objective test is to ensure a “uniform standard of self-control” so that the defence is not available to persons “who overreact because they are ‘exceptionally pugnacious and bad-tempered and over-sensitive’”: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kwan Cin Cheng </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Kwan Cin </span><span class="font-italic">Cheng</span>”) at [65]. There are two types of characteristics the court can take into account in assessing if the provocation in question is grave: (a) characteristics affecting a similarly placed reasonable man’s level of self-control (such as age and sex) and (b) characteristics affecting the gravity of the provocation. This means that the mental background of an accused person may be taken into account in assessing the gravity of the alleged provocation: <span class="font-italic">Kwan Cin Cheng </span>at [50], <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>at [61]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The criterion “sudden” is more amenable to <span class="font-italic">a priori </span>definition and the following non-exhaustive principles can be gleaned as such (<span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>at [45]–[46]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The provocation should be unexpected. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is no room for premeditation and calculation.

He was then kept overnight in a lock-up with about ten other persons. Some of them were talking and the person beside him was snoring, as a result of which he could not sleep the whole night. He was brought to a court in Malacca the next morning, where he waited very long before beginning what he described as a long and arduous journey back to Singapore. The taking of the 5 April 2016 statement in Singapore commenced at 7.25pm and ended at 8.25pm.

It was not necessary for me to decide whether the inaccuracy arose because the accused misspoke and gave inaccurate information to the recording officer due to his fatigued state or because the recording officer misheard the accused and therefore mis-recorded the accused’s narrative. It sufficed for me to note that the disputed portion of the 5 April 2016 statement appeared to be an outlier which was inconsistent with all other statements given by the accused to the police, as well as inconsistent with his narration of events to the psychiatrist who examined him and to his landlord. Significantly, the accused’s telephone conversation with his landlord took place two days after the offence and more than ten days before the 5 April 2016 statement. The accused had voluntarily called the landlord and confessed to killing the deceased. There was also no evidence that the accused knew the phone call was being recorded. Further, as noted at [48] above, it appeared that there were other inaccuracies in the 5 April 2016 statement. It was therefore unsafe to place so much weight on the 5 April 2016 statement and give no weight to the other statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71  The Prosecution also submitted that the accused possessed the ability to control his actions since he was “thinking about that casino guy and Tian Meng” while he was strangling the deceased and was aware that the deceased was struggling.

</div>  As noted in <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>at [42], whether post-killing conduct is relevant in assessing the subjective test depends on the facts of each case, as the conduct of different individuals after they recover their composure (partially or completely) after momentarily losing it can vary infinitely and is contingent on the existence of incalculable imponderables. In the present case, the evidence was that immediately after the deceased’s death, the accused was in a state of shock, and it was only after the accused had 10 to 15 minutes to regain his composure that the thought came to him to undress the deceased and attempt to penetrate her. In my view, this interval of 10 to 15 minutes was sufficiently long to dminish the relevance of the accused’s post-killing conduct as an indicator of whether he had lost his self-control prior to the killing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Therefore, I found that the subjective test for the loss of self-control was satisfied in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The objective test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As a starting point, I accepted that the provocation was sudden. The accused first asked the deceased about the man from the casino, whom he had seen her with. The deceased replied saying that they had gone out on four to five occasions. The accused then asked who Tian Meng was, as he suspected Tian Meng of being the deceased’s ex-boyfriend, based on some messages he had seen on the deceased’s phone some years ago.

After the deceased ended their relationship, the accused arranged a meeting with her to beg her to resume their relationship. At the meeting, when the accused shared about his suicidal thoughts, the deceased replied in a callous tone that he was “useless” and doubted if he dared to kill himself. She also related that she was very happy with her new boyfriend, and that his death would have nothing to do with her. On hearing these words, the accused took the knife that he had planned to kill himself with had she rejected him, and stabbed her to death. The accused gave evidence that he interpreted the deceased’s remark that she was very happy with her new boyfriend as meaning that she was very happy when she was in bed with her new boyfriend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Court of Appeal noted that (at [70]–[71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… On the evidence, it was clear that the respondent and deceased had been lovers. The Prosecution did not challenge the appellant’s evidence that <span class="font-italic">he and the deceased had treated each other as husband and wife from 1992 to 1996</span>, and that she had introduced him to her colleagues as her husband at a company outing in April 1996; nor did it cast doubt on his evidence that he had continued to have sexual relations with her as late as 9 September 1996. Prosecution witnesses such as Kee, the deceased’s room-mate and friend, and Phang Ai Hwa, her sister, agreed that their relationship was “good” and they were a “loving couple” until July 1996 …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Prosecution contended that the respondent could not have reasonably felt provoked when the deceased disclosed that she had a new boyfriend, because their relationship had ended on 9 September 1996. But the trial judge accepted his evidence that thereafter <span class="font-italic">he still harboured hopes of persuading her to return to him, and this was his purpose behind arranging their </span><span class="font-italic">meeting on 4 October 1996</span>. As the learned judge noted, nobody – including Kee and the deceased – told the respondent for a fact that the deceased had a new boyfriend. The respondent had not confronted the deceased about his suspicions because he was afraid of losing her. <span class="font-italic">Up to 9 September 1996, the deceased still met with the respondent and had sex with him</span>. When she ended their relationship on that day, she did not tell him she had a new boyfriend; instead, she explained that her father had objected to their relationship.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In light of the above circumstances, the court found (at [72]) that the accused must have been in “an emotional, vulnerable state of mind” when he was begging the deceased to return to him. The deceased’s callousness to him, along with her disclosure that she had a new boyfriend, would also have added to his distress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([60] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the accused decided to pay a visit to his girlfriend one morning after being told that she was sick at home. Instead of knocking on the front door immediately upon arriving at the deceased’s apartment, he decided to peep through her bedroom window from the common corridor to check if she was asleep. To his horror, he discovered the deceased lying on her bed and kissing a man wearing a red tee shirt. The accused arranged to meet the deceased the same evening, where he confronted her about the man. He stabbed her to death after she told him that the man was a better lover than he. In its analysis of whether the alleged provocation was considered grave, the Court of Appeal noted the following facts which bear quoting (at [59]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It follows that the deceased’s taunt that the man in the red tee shirt was a better lover than the accused ought not to be viewed in isolation, and its effects on the accused must be considered against the background of their strained relationship and the events that transpired earlier that day. <span class="font-italic">It</span><span class="font-italic"> was clear that the accused loved the deceased passionately although their relationship was nothing short of tumultuous. He has both a possessive and obsessive personality and is prone to emotional outbursts. </span>The accused had brought her to meet his parents, met her frequently <span class="font-weight-bold">and often had sex with her.</span> He had also met both her parents, professed his love for the deceased and promised to marry her. Further, he had also manifested his commitment to her repeatedly despite the ever present turbulence in their relationship … He had bought the deceased a “Thali”, a Hindu nuptial chain, to symbolise that she was his wife. <span class="font-weight-bold">Even after the deceased made the police report against him for raping her, they reconciled and continued to see each other and again revived their intimate relationship</span>. In fact, on 5 July 2008, just two days before the killing, the accused and the deceased went to Sentosa and spent the night together in a tent where they had sex. In addition, <span class="font-italic">only minutes before</span><span class="font-italic"> killing her</span>, the accused <span class="font-weight-bold">told the deceased’s mother that he wanted to marry the deceased and “see [her] face everyday”</span>. He also said that he used to join gangs in the past but had changed after meeting the deceased and also started going to church every Saturday under her influence. It was clear that, tragically, their lives had become intensely and inextricably intertwined. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The court noted that the accused had confronted the deceased expecting that she would seek forgiveness for her infidelity with the other man. Instead, she angrily ridiculed him by asserting that the accused’s sexual prowess was inferior to that of the man and had sought to justify her infidelity. As a result, considering “the accused’s intensely passionate feelings for the deceased and the fact that he expected to reconcile with her and marry her, it was more probable than not that the deceased’s taunt that the man in the red tee shirt was a ‘better lover’ than he transported his passions to such an extent that he entirely lost his self control momentarily” (at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Coming back to the factors listed at [76] above, with regard to the first factor, it was my view that the nature of the accused’s and deceased’s relationship militated against a conclusion that the revelation by the deceased that she was intimate with Tian Meng constituted a provocation that was objectively grave. Although it was not disputed that the accused regarded the deceased as his girlfriend,

</div> the accused admitted that he never had sex with the deceased or kissed the deceased during their four-year relationship. They had only ever held hands once. The accused had never asked the deceased to be his girlfriend. In fact, when he had asked her to marry him, his own evidence was that he had said, “Xiang, <span class="font-italic">if</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[you] don’t have a boyfriend, please marry me.” [emphasis added]. When the deceased remained silent, the accused’s evidence was essentially that he did not feel much and their relationship carried on without any noticeable change. On the totality of the evidence and the circumstances, I found that the accused must have understood that the two of them were in a non-exclusive relationship. The somewhat unfortunate reality seemed to be that while the accused was infatuated with the deceased, any romantic interest was unrequited and their relationship was confined to them regularly going out, shorn of any form of physical intimacy as would typically be common between couples. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As for the second factor, while it was clear from <span class="font-italic">Kwan Cin Cheng </span>([61] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>that the mental background of the accused is relevant (see [61] above), the factual scenario here was quite different.

</div> Nor was there evidence that the deceased calling the accused “useless foodie” during the lunch on 21 March 2016 somehow added to his mental fragility. The accused’s evidence was that, even though he felt very angry, he decided not to quarrel with her as they would not be able to enjoy their lunch if they started quarrelling.

</div> Finally, the accused’s own testimony failed to bear out the Defence’s submission that the deceased’s rejection of his sexual advances added to his mental fragility. While the accused testified that he was angry when the deceased replied “crazy, get lost” on his first sexual advance, his evidence was that shortly after, he felt “very bad for hurting her feelings” and felt very awkward about forcing himself on her and had thus asked her to go home. His evidence was that he was not angry with her for rejecting his advances but rather he thought he had done her wrong.

It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind’s activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise the will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whether there is an abnormality of mind is predicated on what the reasonable man would term as abnormal in all the circumstances. This is typically analysed in terms of three aspects of the mind’s activities: the capacity to understand events, judge the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions, and exercise self-control, as they will inevitably be quite accurate proxies of the extent of an offender’s ability to exercise his will power to control his physical acts. However, these three indicia are not exhaustive. In principle, an offender may succeed in establishing that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind even if he is unable to pigeonhole the abnormality he relies on into one of the three aspects of the mind just mentioned, provided he can show that his mental responsibility for his acts was substantially impaired as a result of this: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [24]–[26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In respect of the second limb, it is clear from <span class="font-italic">Iskandar </span>that it is meant to be read restrictively, and the onus is on the accused to identify which of the prescribed causes is applicable in his case (at [89]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The third limb is concerned with the connection between the offender’s abnormality of mind and his mental responsibility for his acts or omissions in relation to the offence. The requirement of <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>impairment means that there must be a real and material (as opposed to trivial or minimal) impairment of the accused’s mental state although it need not rise to the level of amounting to an unsoundness of mind contemplated under s 84 of the PC. While medical evidence would be important in determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether an offender’s mental responsibility was <span class="font-italic">substantially </span>impaired is ultimately a question of fact to be decided by the court based on all the evidence before it. The requirement of substantial impairment does not entail that the offender’s abnormality of mind must be the <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of his offending, but merely that it had an <span class="font-italic">influence</span> on the offender’s actions: <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [33].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defence’s submission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 According to the Defence, the abnormality of mind suffered by the accused was two-pronged.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In cross-examination, defence counsel did not challenge either doctor’s opinion that the accused was not suffering from intellectual disability. Nor did defence counsel challenge Dr Phang’s opinion that the accused had no abnormality of mind or any form of mental disorder. Similarly, Dr Phang’s opinion that the accused’s anger was not due to any mental illness, mental disorder or impulse control disorder also went unchallenged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First limb: Presence of abnormality of the mind</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Given the state of the medical evidence, it was not surprising that the Defence chose not to submit that the accused was suffering from intellectual disability or any form of recognised mental disorder. Instead, the Defence chose to submit that the accused’s abnormality of mind lay in his tendency to place more emotional investment in a loving relationship with a woman and his inability to control himself in relation to severe provocations or disappointments arising out of such loving relationships. The difficulty with this submission was that it was not supported by any evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Concerning the accused’s alleged tendency to place more emotional investment in a loving relationship with a woman, the Defence only led evidence concerning the accused’s relationship with the deceased, and failed to lead evidence about the accused’s level of emotional investment in his relationships with his four earlier girlfriends. Consequently, there was no evidence to support the view that the accused had a “tendency” to place more emotional investment in a loving relationship with a woman than the average person.  Therefore, quite apart from the conceptual question of whether such a tendency could amount to an abnormality of mind, there was simply no evidence from which the court could surmise that the accused’s state of mind in relation to this matter was so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Concerning the accused’s alleged inability to control himself in relation to severe provocations or disappointments arising out of a loving relationship with a woman, I failed to see how the loss of self-control in the face of severe provocations or severe disappointments would amount to an abnormality of mind. It would appear to be entirely within the range of normal human behaviour for someone to lose self-control in the face of severe provocations or severe disappointments. In any event, the evidence did not support a finding that the accused was suffering from an inability to control himself in relation to severe provocations or disappointments arising out of a loving relationship with a woman. No evidence was led about how the accused handled the failure of his four earlier relationships or how he felt about any disappointments he may have encountered in those relationships. In respect of the accused’s relationship with the deceased, there was also a lack of evidence of his inability to control himself in the face of any previous provocations or disappointments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I therefore found that the Defence failed to establish on the balance of probabilities that the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second limb: Root cause of abnormality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Given my findings on the first limb, it was strictly not necessary for me to deal with the second limb. Nevertheless, it may be useful to point out that even if the first limb had been made out, the defence would still fail on the second limb. As noted above, the second limb is largely to be determined based on expert evidence. Given that the two experts did not identify any mental disorder or abnormality of mind which the accused was suffering from and, in particular, given that the two experts did not address their opinions to the two matters relied on by the Defence as the accused’s alleged abnormality of mind, it followed that there was a complete lack of expert evidence concerning the root cause of the two matters relied on by the Defence. Given this lack of evidence, the court would not be in a position to draw any conclusions concerning the root cause of the two matters.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third limb: Impairment of mental responsibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Given my conclusions on the first and second limbs, the third limb simply did not arise for consideration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on diminished responsibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the reasons given above, I concluded that the defence of diminished responsibility had not been made out on the balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the light of my findings at [57], [86] and [107] above, I convicted the accused of the charge of murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Applying the principles laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Kho Jabing </span>[2015] 2 SLR 112, the Prosecution submitted that the present case was <span class="font-italic">not </span>one that so “outrage[d] the feelings of the community” as to call for the death sentence. The Prosecution noted that the accused acted without premeditation and the manner in which he killed the deceased could not be said to have crossed the threshold of acting with “viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life”. The Defence associated itself with the Prosecution’s submission and added that the accused was a first time offender and deeply remorseful. I accepted these submissions and sentenced the accused to imprisonment for life. As the accused was above 50 years of age, no sentence of caning was imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Pang Khang Chau  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Kok Weng and Jason Chua for the Prosecution;<br/>Eugene Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen and Hamza Malik <br/>(Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
