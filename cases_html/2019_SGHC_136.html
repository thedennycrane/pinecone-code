</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Loke also relied on a video recording of the movements of Soh on three days, these being 25, 26 and 29 October 2017. This was done by a private investigator who also included photographs from Soh’s Facebook account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In Soh’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he said that he experiences weaknesses in his knee, sore muscles, tingling nerve sensation, pain, and aches in his right leg when he stands or walks. He can no longer squat or kneel at all. He cannot bend his right knee in full or fold his right leg or sit cross-legged. He has problems using public toilets that do not have seats. He also said that there is observable difference in the size of his thighs and he has various scars on his right leg and one scar on his left thigh due to skin taken out to graft onto his right thigh. The scars are prominent when he wears shorts that do not go past his knee. Therefore, he is hesitant to go swimming or to the beach or even sports gatherings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Soh has a job as a technician with an oil tank company. He said that his job is physically demanding. He has to be able to walk briskly, ride a bicycle around the tank farm areas or the jetty berths, climb ladders and stairs, walk on pipelines, navigate through tight and narrow areas, as well as climb over walls that are knee high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 He alleged that his superior, Chan Kong Fatt (“Mr Chan”), who has been promoted to senior operations manager, had informed Soh that if Soh were not an existing employee, Mr Chan would not consider employing Soh because of the physical demands of the job. Soh stated that he understood that it was by grace that he could still keep his job. If there were a downturn in the oil market and retrenchment, Soh believed that he would probably be one of the first to be retrenched given his disabilities. If he were to lose his job, it would not be possible for him to find another job in the same field. With a GCE ‘O’ level certificate and a diploma in culinary skills from the Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre, he was not certain about finding another job easily in a different industry because even a cook has to stand and move around all the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I noted that Soh did not call Mr Chan or anyone else from his employer to give evidence for him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Although Prof Tay had mentioned that Soh had a 2cm shortening of his right leg and had a painful limp, Dr Lee said that he did not notice any painful limp when he examined Soh. Dr Lee noted that Prof Doshi’s report (dated 26 October 2016) mentioned that Soh was able to walk independently without aids. That said, Dr Lee observed, from the video recording of Soh, that there was a mild limp, Soh was not using any shoe raise and he was able to walk briskly with large strides.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Photos taken by Dr Lee of Soh, when Dr Lee examined Soh, showed that Soh can kneel with his body in an upright position. He can sit cross-legged but his legs cannot be pushed flat onto the ground. Dr Lee accepted that Soh cannot squat completely and has occasional pain in his right knee but noted that there was no mention (in other reports) of Soh having to consume analgesia to cope with the pain. Dr Lee was of the view that there was mild limitation in the range of motion of the right knee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On Soh’s job prospects, Loke submitted that notwithstanding the many number of days of medical leave that Soh had been on, Soh had been promoted twice. Soh’s accident was in November 2010. However, he was promoted to Technician Grade B from 1 January 2012. He was subsequently promoted to Senior Technician I from 1 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Loke referred to various job appraisals which commended Soh. A Year End Appraisal 2012 stated, “[a]fter his long medical due to motorcycle accident, [Soh] came back to work doing panel-man duties. This year he has start [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] doing field work, he is able to cope and do the tank-farm and jetty duties quite well”.

The item numbers refer to the serial numbers in the Annex.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 2 – Right upper leg injury</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Soh claimed $60,000 to $75,000 for this injury. Loke suggested $30,000 which he then increased to $32,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It seemed to me that the case which was closest to this injury was the case of <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chee Siong v </span><span class="font-italic">Salpac (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHC 304 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo</span>”). There, the High Court awarded $40,000. I reproduce [25] and [26] of the grounds of decision there:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 The Plaintiff asked for $40,000, submitting that the fractures were serious, resulted in serious disabilities and a complicated recovery process. The Defendant submitted that $30,000 would be appropriate, submitting that while “the Plaintiff did suffer from 1 cm shortening of the left leg, he does not require further treatment as the fracture has healed well”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 It is clear to me that the Plaintiff suffered severe leg injuries in the Accident. The shortening of the Plaintiff’s left leg resulted in a limping gait, an inability to squat and a pre-disposition to post-traumatic arthritis or osteoporosis. The leg injuries continued to cause him pains in his thigh even at the time of trial, where he sustained fractures of his left tibia and fibula. I also note that there was a femoral fracture that involve its distal articular surface which forms part of the knee joint. Taken together, these injuries have caused a painful and complicated recovery. Some of the consequences are permanent such as the inability to squat and a limping gait and some will continue to cause the Plaintiff pain on a daily basis. I am also satisfied that these injuries would affect his chances of finding employment, given that the scope of jobs that the Plaintiff pursued is physical in nature. As such, I took the view that a quantum on the higher end would be appropriate and awarded the Plaintiff $40,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the present case, Soh still had a 2cm shortening of his right leg while the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Yeo</span> had a 1cm shortening. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">Yeo,</span> there was mention of a complicated recovery process but no elaboration. Here, Soh had been in and out of hospital at various times and undergone various surgical procedures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 For example, on 16 December 2013, he underwent a corrective closing wedge osteotomy of the right distal femur.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On 1 December 2014, he underwent:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a right femur proximal corticotomy; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) application of distracting external fixation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These procedures were to increase the length of his right leg.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The initial period of medical leave for Soh was 147 days. This increased to 566 days as of August 2015, after each of the various procedures were done.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Unlike in <span class="font-italic">Yeo</span>, Soh underwent osteotomy and distraction corticotomy. That said, Soh was still able to continue with his employment and, according to Loke’s case, Soh was even promoted twice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the circumstances, I decided to award $50,000 which was higher than the $40,000 awarded in <span class="font-italic">Yeo.</span> I took into account the number of procedures Soh had to undergo and the lengthy medical leave he had to take, as well as some overlapping between items 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the Annex. Because of overlapping, I did not allow any sum for items 6 and 9 and allowed a sum at the lower end for items 3 and 5 and an agreed sum for item 4. On this group of items, Soh’s appeal pertains to items 3, 6 and 9. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 3 – Disabling knee injuries: torn medial meniscus, torn lateral meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament (“ACL”) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I awarded Soh $12,000 for item 3. Soh alleged that he had suffered the above injuries while Loke suggested that the ACL was not torn. However, the latter suggestion was because Loke’s expert witness, Dr Lee, said that there was a 25% to 35% tear only and since it was not a complete tear, the correct terminology was to call it “a sprain”. Whatever the correct terminology was, there was a 25% to 35% tear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok </span><span class="font-italic">Hian v Tian Seow Liang </span>(DC Suit No 971/1998), an award of $15,000 was given for 50% tear of the ACL and tear to the lateral meniscus.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, even based on his submissions, the question was whether his residual disabilities were so severe as to greatly impact his overall enjoyment of life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Soh cited three cases in his submissions.  The first was <span class="font-italic">Lai Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd</span> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 525 (CA) and [1983–1984] SLR(R) 388 (PC). There, the plaintiff suffered from a great reduction of mental powers, change of personality, neurogenic bladder, inability to have sexual intercourse, and the loss of the prospect of a happy marriage. The plaintiff was awarded $40,000 for loss of amenities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The second case was <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Repin v Lim Yu Kee</span> [1968–1970] SLR(R) 200 where the plaintiff was awarded $60,000 for loss of amenities as he was rendered completely blind by the accident, having been already blind in one eye from childhood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The third case was <span class="font-italic">Ang Siam Hua v Teo Cheng Hoe</span> [2004] SGHC 147. There, an assistant registrar awarded $10,000 for loss of amenities to compensate the plaintiff for the combined effect of individual disabilities on the overall function of the body even though she had taken into account the loss of amenities associated with each particular injury when making an award for each individual injury.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, Soh’s injuries were not so severe as to greatly impact his overall enjoyment of life even though he could not engage very actively in sports. His injuries were clearly less severe than in the first two cases cited. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As for the third case, I did not agree that there should be an additional award for loss of amenities over and above the individual awards when loss of amenities had already been taken into account in the individual award. There was also no suggestion there that the overall impact of the injuries was so severe as to greatly affect Soh’s overall enjoyment of life. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Item 11 – Loss of earning capacity (post-trial)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As can be seen from the Annex, Soh had claimed pre-trial and post-trial loss of earning capacity (“LEC”). I made a nil award for both items. He is not appealing for pre-trial LEC and is appealing only for post-trial LEC. The claim for this item was for the highest sum of the various sums he was claiming.  As his appeal is confined only to post-trial LEC, I will use the short form “LEC” to refer to this head of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Loke submitted that a claim for LEC must be pleaded in view of O 18 rr 12(1A) and 12(1C) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). As this was not done by Soh, Loke submitted that Soh was precluded from claiming for LEC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Order 18 r 12(1A) provides that a plaintiff in an action for personal injuries shall serve with his statement of claim:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a medical report; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a statement of the special damages claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Order 18 r 12(1C) defines “a statement of the special damages claimed” to mean “a statement giving full particulars of the special damages claimed for expenses and losses already incurred and an estimate of any future expenses and losses (including loss of earnings, loss of Central Provident Fund contributions and loss of pension rights)”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As can be seen, Loke had misinterpreted the relevant provision. The phrase “loss of earnings” refers to loss of income and not LEC. Loke had conflated the two different heads of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Even Loke’s reliance on the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Tong and another</span> <span class="font-italic">v Li Ping Sum</span> [1985] 2 WLR 396 did not take his argument much further. There, the court said, at p 404, “[i]t may be that it is not essential to plead this head of damages, but their Lordships consider that as a matter of good practice it ought, as a general rule, to be pleaded in order to give fair notice to the defendant”. Hence, that case is not authority for the proposition that a claim for LEC must be pleaded failing which a plaintiff is precluded from claiming this. Furthermore, Loke did not suggest that he was caught by surprise by this claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Nevertheless, that case is useful for the guidance it gives about the evidence that is required. At pp 404–405, the court said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that she was entitled to at least a conventional award under this head, without any evidence being required. But that submission rests on a misconception. A claim for loss of future earning capacity usually arises where the claimant is in employment at the time when the claim falls to be evaluated. The claim is to cover the risk that, at some future date during the claimant’s working life, he will lose his employment and will then suffer financial loss because of his disadvantage in the labour market. The court has to evaluate the present value of that future risk: see <span class="font-italic">Moeliker</span><span class="font-italic"> v. A Reyrolle &amp; Co. Ltd</span> [1977] 1 W.L.R. 132, 140 where Browne L.J. dealt fully with this matter. Evidence is therefore required in order to prove the extent, if any, of the risk that the claimant will at some future time during his working life lose his employment. If he is, and has been for many years, in secure employment with a public authority the risk may be negligible. In other cases, the degree of risk may vary almost infinitely, depending on inter alia the claimant’s age and the nature of his employment. Evidence will also be generally required in order to show how far the claimant’s earning capacity would be adversely affected by his disability. This will depend largely on the nature of his employment. Loss of an arm or a leg will have a much more serious effect upon the earning capacity of a labourer than on that of an accountant. In the present case there is no evidence at all on these matters. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Soh submitted that he must satisfy two limbs for his claim for LEC:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there must be a risk that he will lose the job he holds at the time of trial; and    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) as a result of his injury, he will be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well-paying job.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the first limb, Soh submitted that his residual disabilities put him at a high risk of losing his present job as a technician with an oil tank company. I have set out above his allegation as to what the job entails. Soh said that he would eventually develop severe osteoarthritis of his right knee which would require a total knee replacement (“TKR”). He would also have to undergo multiple other surgical procedures such as a surgery to remove an internal fixator, arthroscopy for the meniscus tears and ACL reconstruction. He would have to take extensive medical leave and also take time off for consultation and physiotherapy. Therefore, there was a significant risk that his employer would eventually tire of having to accommodate him and let him go when the opportunity arises.

</div>
</div>
</div> Indeed, as mentioned above at [9], Soh also alleged that it was by grace that he could keep his job. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50  However, Soh had already taken extensive medical leave in the past after the accident. As mentioned above, he had to take 566 days of medical leave over various years. Yet, he kept his job. Apparently he was even promoted twice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Soh also submitted that there was a significant risk that he would be retrenched in the event of an economic downturn or corporate restructuring especially since his employer is in the volatile oil and gas industry. If there was any retrenchment he would be the first to be retrenched in view of his residual disabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I reiterate that Soh elected not to call any evidence from his employer about his job prospects with that employer even though he referred to what his superior Mr Chan had allegedly told him. There was also no medical evidence about any disadvantage or the extent of the disadvantage in securing a job should he in fact lose his job. Accordingly, there was no other evidence to support his allegations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the contrary, the appraisals or reviews of Soh, which Loke relied on, suggested that Soh’s employer thought well of Soh’s performance. This was to Soh’s credit. However, he could not establish that it was by his employer’s grace that he could keep his job or that if there was any downturn, he would be the first of the employees to be retrenched. Furthermore, it was difficult to say that he would be disadvantaged, because of his disabilities, in getting another job if he were in fact retrenched. It was also difficult to assess the extent of the disability in getting another job. In my view, Soh had made a sweeping statement “[g]iven the nature of his residual disabilities, he is unlikely to be able to find another blue-collar job”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for osteoarthritis eventually setting in, this could be resolved with a TKR (for which a separate award was made).

</div> On that basis, Soh claimed $8,591. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Dr Lee was of the view that it was optional to remove the fixation plating and screws since the fracture had consolidated. He estimated the cost of removal to be about $3,410 (for a class B1 ward) if it was performed in a government restructured hospital. He was not challenged on the quantum. Loke submitted that if the court was minded to allow this item, it should be for $3,410.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Since Loke did not appear to challenge this item in principle too vigorously, I was inclined to allow the claim in principle. On the question of cost, the information from MOH covered a wide range of costs depending on the hospital and the class of ward. It could be as low as $576 for a low size bill to as high as about $17,000 for a high size bill. There was no elaboration from Soh as to how he had derived the figure of $8,591. In the circumstances, I was of the view that Dr Lee’s estimate of $3,410 was preferable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I next address Soh’s claim for arthroscopy ($20,082) and ACL reconstruction ($31,863).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In Prof Naidu’s report dated 23 April 2015, he mentioned these two procedures but estimated the cost to be $10,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Prof Tay’s report dated 5 January 2017 mentioned the need to remove an implant (as discussed above). There was no mention of the need for arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction. However, in re-examination, he said that there was instability in the relevant knee even though it was a partial tear. He said that he would recommend an ACL reconstruction if Soh found the instability unacceptable and it affected his lifestyle. Therefore, the arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction were elective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On the other hand, Dr Lee was of the view that these procedures were not necessary as a radiologist (who had done an MRI of Soh’s right knee in 2016) had reported the ACL as “grossly intact”. However, this did not mean that the ACL was completely intact because Dr Lee had also said that there was a partial tear of 25% to 35%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 There was some confusion in the evidence about the need for these two procedures. Loke did not dispute the report of Prof Naidu dated 23 April 2015 which was part of the Agreed Bundle. Loke also did not require Prof Naidu to be cross-examined. This therefore suggested that Loke was precluded from disputing the need for these procedures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 However, Soh had also appointed Prof Tay as his independent expert. Prof Tay’s report dated 5 January 2017 made no mention of the need for these procedures. Furthermore, in re-examination, Prof Tay said they were electives.

In his Supplementary AEIC of 23 September 2015, Soh said that due to his long medical leave and that he had exhausted all his medical leave for the year, he would put off these procedures for as long as possible.

</div> Therefore, Soh should be entitled to make his claim based on private rates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I would not have agreed to more than $10,000 because Soh had been going to TTSH from April 2015 when he consulted Prof Naidu. In 2016, he consulted Prof Doshi at TTSH as well. There was no suggestion that the procedures were so complicated as to require Prof Naidu’s attention. Furthermore, Soh was apparently again relying on MOH figures which had a wide range and were not helpful without elaboration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I come now to the cost of TKR.

The total of the various claims which I was allowing under item 12 would therefore be $25,730 less $10,000 making a total of $15,730 (which should have been $15,370 if no error was made).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There was also some evidence from Prof Tay that a second TKR would eventually also be required

</div> although Loke disputed the need for a second TKR. I was prepared to allow for a second TKR which was likely since a TKR would be effective for about 20 years and Soh was still young. However, this second TKR would be, say, 40 years later. Hence, adopting a similar approach as for the first TKR but taking into account that the second TKR would be much later, I allowed $5,000 only.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The costs order for Soh to pay Loke $20,000, excluding disbursements, was based on an offer to settle (“OTS”) from Loke to Soh.

I fixed the quantum of costs after taking into account standard costs for Soh before 15 May 2018, as that was the date the OTS was served on Soh’s lawyers, and indemnity costs for Loke thereafter.

Secondly, pre-trial loss of earning capacity is not recognised in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Yvonne Yap</span> at [31] and [42]–[43]).
