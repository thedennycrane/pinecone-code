The Co-Gen Facility was developed by a company called Profound Heritage Sdn Bhd (“PHSB”) between 1997 and 1999, at a cost of RM155m with financing from Malayan Banking Bhd (“Maybank”) and Bank Islam (L) Ltd (“Bank Islam”) (however, see [149] below discussing the actual use of the loan from Bank Islam). The loan from Maybank was for RM118,250,000 (“the RM118.25m loan”) while the loan from Bank Islam was for US$24m (“the US$24m loan”). PHSB was owned and controlled by the Defendant until it was wound up by an order of court in Malaysia on 11 January 2012 for failing to pay its debts. The court-appointed liquidators were Mr Ooi Woon Chee (“Ooi”) and Mr Ong Hock An (“Ong”) (jointly “the Liquidators”) who were from KPMG Corporate Services Sdn Bhd (“KPMG”). PHSB came out of liquidation on 19 June 2015.

</div> The Co-Gen Facility was operated by PHSB and supplied electricity to the SH Resort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I should add that PHSB was itself owned by Vibrant Square Sdn Bhd (“Vibrant”) who had as its shareholder another BVI company called Osterly Holdings Limited (“Osterly”), which held 30% of the shares in Vibrant, while the remaining 70% were owned by one Datuk Zarazilah (“Zarazilah”). Osterly’s shares are owned by the Defendant. Further, the evidence adduced in court from the Defendant was that Zarazilah held the 70% shares in Vibrant in trust for him. As the Defendant owned all the shares in Osterly (which held 30% of the shares in Vibrant) and Zarazilah held the remaining 70% in trust for him, that meant that the Defendant was the ultimate owner of and wholly controlled PHSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Since at least 2002 (see [164] below), tenancy agreements had been entered into between SHGCC and PHSB on an annual basis for the rental of the Subject Land.

Under the settlement terms, PHSB would make payment of RM33.6m to Bank Islam to discharge the charge which Bank Islam held over PHSB’s plant and machinery and all other securities. The settlement sum of RM33.6m, together with various fees payable under the settlement agreement for a total of RM34.438m, was paid to Bank Islam on or about 28 March 2013 by OBSB and/or the Defendant on behalf of PHSB. As noted below at [157], however, the Defendant admitted that the money came from another of his companies, Investasia Sdn Bhd (“Investasia”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 12 July 2013, OBSB (represented by the Defendant) and the Liquidators of PHSB executed an asset sale agreement (“the ASA”) for the sale of PHSB’s plant and machinery to OBSB in consideration for the RM33.6m paid to Bank Islam on PHSB’s behalf in March 2013, as recounted by Recital D of the ASA. Under cl 2.2.4 of the ASA, the Subject Land was expressly excluded from the sale but the Co-Gen Facility was included.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Prior to completion of the SA on 26 March 2014 (see [4] above), the Defendant had issued to the Plaintiff a disclosure letter dated 18 March 2014 (“the Disclosure Letter”) (which was wrongly dated 18 March 2013) where no mention was made of the S&amp;P or the Transaction.

</div> To avoid paying the high costs involved in the arbitration proceedings, the Defendant proposed to the Plaintiff that the dispute be brought to court instead. The Plaintiff agreed, and the arbitration proceedings were terminated by consent on 30 November 2016. On the same day, the Plaintiff filed this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Notwithstanding the fact that it was the Defendant who requested the Plaintiff to opt for curial instead of arbitral proceedings, the Defendant applied to court to stay this Suit on 27 December 2016 (“the Stay Application”). The Stay Application was granted by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) on 7 April 2017. The AR ordered a limited stay of all proceedings in this Suit against the Defendant until 31 July 2017 and awarded costs to the Defendant. The date 31 July 2017 was chosen by the AR as the trial of the Malaysian Suit had been fixed to take place between 19 and 22 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Plaintiff appealed against the decision of the AR by way of a Registrar’s Appeal which this court heard and allowed.

</div> in the Malaysian Suit, SHGCC alleged that the Defendant was the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> as well as the directing mind and will of OBSB. The SHGCC SOC pleaded that PHSB was granted a licence (before its liquidation on 11 January 2012) under the relevant Electricity Act 1990 to generate electricity for sale and distribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The SHGCC SOC then referred to the tenancy agreement between SHGCC and PHSB over the Subject Land for which PHSB paid monthly rent to SHGCC. The tenancy agreement was terminated on 30 November 2013 and was not extended or renewed. Pursuant to the ASA, PHSB sold the plant and machinery located on the Subject Land to OBSB. However, the Subject Land itself was expressly excluded from the sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 By the S&amp;P (which SHGCC contended was actually signed on 24 March 2014 but backdated to 1 March 2014), the Subject Land was purportedly sold by SHGCC to OBSB for a consideration of RM1,000 even though its market value exceeded RM250,000. The S&amp;P was signed by two directors of SHGCC namely, Foo Kia Inn (“Foo”) and Zarazilah on the instructions and direction of the Defendant. The Defendant himself signed the S&amp;P on behalf of OBSB as its director together with Ms Wong Lee Ken (“WLK”), another director of OBSB who was concurrently the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of SHGCC at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 SHGCC alleged it only discovered the S&amp;P and the Transaction in August/September 2015 during a tax review exercise carried out by SHGCC’s tax consultants. On or about 25 September 2015, SHGCC returned to OBSB the sum of RM1,000 paid for the Transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the SA was only completed on 26 March 2014, SHGCC alleged that the Defendant took expedited steps to cause the sale and disposal of the Subject Land by way of the S&amp;P and the Transaction, given that the S&amp;P was signed on 24 March 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Consequently, SHGCC alleged that the Defendant had breached the fiduciary duties he owed to SHGCC as well as his duties as trustee of the assets of SHGCC. It was alleged that the Defendant owed obligations as a trustee in respect of SHGCC’s assets, in particular the Subject Land. SHGCC further alleged that in causing SHGCC to enter into the S&amp;P and in permitting OBSB to remain in possession of the Subject Land, the Defendant had acted <span class="font-italic">mala </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span> and against the interests of SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The SHGCC SOC claimed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, against the Defendant and OBSB:

</div> the Defendant, averred, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there was a common expectation or assurance shared between SHGCC and PHSB (and with OBSB after July 2013) ever since the development of the Co-Gen Facility on the Subject Land that the Subject Land was to be a separate parcel of land from the Sembulan Land, and that it would be owned and occupied by the developer of the Co-Gen Facility (“the Common Expectation”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Defendant alleged that in reasonable reliance on the Common Expectation, PHSB (and since 2013, OBSB) had planned and carried out various actions which included developing the Subject Land to house, and constructing, the Co-Gen Facility at a cost of approximately RM155m (“the construction cost”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Defendant averred that in order to borrow monies to cover the construction cost from Bank Islam, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the US$24m loan, he was required to and did give an undertaking to Bank Islam that he would execute a charge over the Subject Land upon subdivision of the Sembulan Land. From 1999 onwards, the Defendant averred that PHSB was able to generate sufficient electricity to supply the SH Resort. After PHSB was wound up on 11 January 2012, the Defendant negotiated with Bank Islam to come to a settlement regarding the US$24m loan and to buy over the assets of PHSB including the Co-Gen Facility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Defendant claimed that prior to the execution of the SA, he had informed Goi (who represented the incoming investors including the Plaintiff) on multiple occasions, that the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land upon which it was sited was not part of the deal.  The Defendant also alleged that representatives from GSH had also conducted a due diligence exercise between October and December 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Defendant contended that OBSB and PHSB would suffer a detriment should SHGCC renege upon or dishonour the Common Expectation as PHSB would have relied on it to develop the Subject Land thereby incurring the requisite expenditure, expertise, and time over the years without the benefit of a registered leasehold ownership over the Subject Land. The Defendant averred that it was unconscionable for SHGCC to resile from or dishonour the Common Expectation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thus, in the Malaysian Suit, the Defendant counterclaimed against SHGCC

In the circumstances, SHGCC is estopped from denying OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land which SHGCC has been ordered to transfer to OBSB.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Stated that the Malaysian court had accepted and upheld the defence by the Defendant and OBSB of the Common Expectation that was shared by SHGCC and PHSB, the developer and prior owner of the Co-Gen Facility on the Subject Land, and, commencing from July 2013, between SHGCC and OBSB, that the Subject Land would be a separate parcel of land to be occupied and owned by OBSB.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Averred that the Common Expectation was supported <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> by the following facts/evidence which was not negated by other agreements referred to by SHGCC in the Malaysian Suit:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pursuant to the development plan (under drawing no. SHR/BLT/2805) dated December 1997 for the development of the Co-Gen Facility on the Subject Land prepared by SHGCC’s and PHSB’s common architect and jointly signed and consented to by SHGCC and PHSB (“the Development Plan”), PHSB had expended the sum of RM155m to develop the Subject Land into the Co-Gen Facility because of the power needs of the SH Resort. This was on the basis of the Common Expectation that the developer would have rights of occupation and ownership as no person would have undertaken the development if it had no rights or occupation or ownership of the Co-Gen Facility.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) From the time of development of the Co-Gen Facility until completion in 1999 and from 1999 until 1 December 2002 when a tenancy agreement was entered into between SHGCC and PHSB (“the 2002 Tenancy”), PHSB had occupied and operated the Subject Land without any written agreement.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The Common Expectation is not negated by the S&amp;P and/or the 2002 Tenancy which SHGCC alleged were admissions by OBSB and the Defendant that SHGCC is the registered and beneficial owner of the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv)  The redemption of PHSB’s debt by OBSB and/or the Defendant in the sum of RM33.6m owed to Bank Islam was only for the assets on the Subject Land and not for the Subject Land itself. This did not negate the Common Expectation as no one would pay the redemption sum of RM33.6m unless the redeemer believed that there was an expectation or assurance that the land on which the assets were constructed would be his.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) The SA neither affirms nor nullifies the Common Expectation.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) OBSB and the Defendant succeeded on a balance of probabilities in establishing the Common Expectation and the elements necessary to invoke the equitable principle of proprietary estoppel against SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Averred he would rely on the Malaysian Judgment at the trial of this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Asserted that PHSB and OBSB had relied on the Common Expectation and would suffer a detriment should the Common Expectation be dishonoured, denied or reneged upon, as they would have developed the Subject Land, incurring the costs of the requisite expenditure, expertise and time over the years, without the benefit of a leasehold ownership over the Subject Land, for which the subdivision of the Subject Land was intended.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Averred that the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land were not part of the acquisition by the Plaintiff under the SA as:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In the course of discussions with Goi when they met to discuss the investment in the SH Resort, the Defendant was asked on about two occasions if the Co-Gen Facility would form part of the SA deal, and the Defendant had informed Goi that the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land were not part of the deal for the new investors which included the Plaintiff, and Goi understood this to be the position.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) At a meeting in Singapore (sometime from October 2013 but before the signing of the SA on 30 December 2013) with the new investors represented <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> by Gilbert Ee Guan Hui (“Gilbert”), Francis Lee Choon Hui (“Francis”) and Kenneth Goi Kok Ming, the Defendant had handed over to the attendees a copy of the report and valuation of SHGCC dated 24 April 2013 (“the Valuation Report”), which valued the net land area on which SHGCC was developed as an area of 94.90 hectares (234.5 acres) and which excluded the Subject Land where the Go-Gen Facility was situated.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Therefore, the Plaintiff had full knowledge or ought to have knowledge of the Co-Gen Facility and its working relationship with the SH Resort companies since it was the power generated by PHSB (and later OBSB) that supplied electricity to the entire resort. OBSB which occupies and operates the Co-Gen Facility is not part of the SH Group and did not comprise part of the acquisition under the SA.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Pursuant to a loan facility made available to PHSB by Bank Islam in 1999 of US$24m, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the US$24m loan, Bank Islam stipulated as a condition that it should have an exclusive charge over the Subject Land. As a result of Bank Islam’s right of security over the Subject Land, other financial institutions that had provided financing to the development of SH Resort in 1999 disclaimed and excluded the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land from the ambit of security over the Sembulan Land.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Pursuant to settlement negotiations reached in March 2013 with Bank Islam, PHSB’s outstanding debts to Bank Islam were discharged through the payment of RM33.6m by the Defendant through OBSB on or about 29 March 2013. The settlement also redeemed Bank Islam’s security over the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Averred that the Plaintiff was at all times aware of the subdivision exercise – since the late 1990s, SHGCC had applied to the Lands and Survey Department Sabah (“LSDS”) to subdivide the Sembulan Land so as to facilitate the transfer of the subdivided parcels of land on which the substations and the Co-Gen Facility were sited to Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (“SESB”) and to the developer/owner of the Co-Gen Facility respectively. SHGCC was aware that the portion of the Sembulan Land, namely the Subject Land, which was the subject of subdivision was not intended to and did not belong to SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Defendant added that on or about 1 October 2014, SHGCC had accepted the amended offer contained in a letter from the Director of LSDS to revise/reduce the annual rent stated in its previous letter of offer dated 27 July 2007 and to delete the prohibition of transfer to anyone save for SESB and the Sabah state government. The representatives who signed the amended offer on behalf of SHGCC were from the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendant further averred that pursuant to the due diligence exercise carried out by the Plaintiff’s legal and financial teams in Singapore and Malaysia prior to the execution of the SA, the Plaintiff had knowledge or reasonably ought to have had knowledge of: (i) the extent of SHGCC’s interest in the Sembulan Land, which would include any restrictions or limitations on, the use of the various parcels within that land; (ii) SHGCC’s application for subdivision of the Sembulan Land; (iii) PHSB’s and OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land; (iv) the discharge of PHSB’s outstanding debt with Bank Islam by the Defendant through OBSB and (v) the extent of any security encumbrance over the Sembulan Land (which excluded the Subject Land) that was being discharged as a result of the new investors (which included the Plaintiff) having discharged the debts of SH Resort with the payment of RM700m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Defendant denied he had breached any warranties in the SA or in Schedules 2 and 4 thereof as alleged by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that Schedule 4 of the SA should be rectified to read as follows (proposed rectification emphasised in italics):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sutera Harbour Golf and Country Club Sdn Bhd is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the parcel of land under 99 years lease of state land situated at Sembulan, District of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, held under Title No. 017544875 (expiring on 31 December 2091) with a total area measuring approximately 95.58 hectares (238.63 acres) <span class="font-italic">save for the parcels of </span><span class="font-italic">land measuring approximately 1.68 acres on which the Co-Gen Facility and sub-stations are situated</span>.

</div> was his assertion that the Plaintiff knew from the Valuation Report of SH Resort, which he had extended to Gilbert and others at a meeting held in Singapore, that the Subject Land on which the Co-Gen Facility was situated was excluded from the sale to the Plaintiff. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), Gilbert deposed that the Valuation Report (which numbered almost a hundred pages) was simply handed to him and the other representatives of GSH at a meeting around October 2013 in Singapore without explanation or presentation of its contents. It was meant only as a reference point for discussions with the Defendant in their negotiations concerning the pricing for the acquisition of a majority stake in SHGCC by GSH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Once a broad agreement had been reached with the Defendant, Gilbert deposed that he left the details and documentation to Alex to handle together with the Defendant’s team’s which included WLK.  Periodically, Alex would update Gilbert on the progress of the acquisition and would also discuss various decisions to be taken with Gilbert.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Gilbert denied the Defendant’s allegation that GSH had reached an understanding with the Defendant that the Subject Land would be excluded from the acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Gilbert explained why GSH invested in SHGCC. He disclosed that before the second half of 2013, the Defendant and the Sutera Target Group were facing financial difficulties and significant pressure from various financial institutions. GSH came to know about the situation and decided it would invest in the Sutera Target Group to help the Defendant, although initially Goi was only interested in two parcels of land that the Defendant owned (namely Plots A and B which are dealt with below at [145]–[146]). Gilbert said the negotiations had been conducted on the basis that GSH would acquire the companies in the Sutera Target Group, rather than just the specific assets.  GSH would take over the companies on an “as is where is” basis and that would include the assets held in the names of each of the companies to be taken over without any exclusions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Gilbert confirmed that throughout the discussions with the Defendant, it was understood that the power plant business was not part of the acquisition. However, there were no specific discussions with the Defendant on the <span class="font-italic">ownership</span> of the Subject Land on which the power plant was situated or whether such land was part of the acquisition. In fact, the Defendant did not discuss the ownership of the Subject Land at all. The Defendant certainly did not disclose to anyone from GSH present at the October 2013 meeting referred to at [56] above that PHSB or OBSB or anyone else owned or had an interest in the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On 30 December 2013 when Gilbert signed the SA on behalf of the Plaintiff, neither he nor Alex nor GSH were aware that PHSB or OBSB or any other entity had or was claiming any interest in the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Prior to completion of the SA on 26 March 2014, the Defendant had provided GSH with the Disclosure Letter dated 18 March 2014 (see [16] above). In the Disclosure Letter, however, the Defendant did not state: (i) that SHGCC did not own the Subject Land, (ii) that PHSB or OBSB or any other entity owned or had any interest in the Subject Land, and (iii) that he intended to sign the S&amp;P for the sale of the Subject Land by PHSB to OBSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 While the Defendant failed to make disclosure of such an important matter as his intended sale of the Subject Land by PHSB to OBSB, he chose to give specific disclosure of such seemingly insignificant matters as a pending case before the Sabah Labour Office by a chef seeking compensation and/or reinstatement after being dismissed from SHGCC. Three days after the Disclosure Letter, the Defendant executed the S&amp;P of the Subject Land to OBSB by PHSB at a consideration of RM1,000 which he then backdated to 1 March 2014. The existence of the S&amp;P was never communicated to GSH prior to or following completion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In cross-examination, counsel for the Defendant, Mr Andy Lem (“Mr Lem”), placed great emphasis on the Valuation Report that the Defendant had handed over to GSH. Mr Lem pointed out to Gilbert that the Valuation Report clearly stated that the net area of the Sembulan Land was 94.9 hectares after deducting the area of the substations. That meant that the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land were excluded. Gilbert disagreed, pointing out that GSH did not rely on the Valuation Report to determine the exact assets of SHGCC or what GSH was buying. GSH would carry out its own due diligence exercise. Gilbert was only interested in the indicative value of SHGCC’s land being RM324m. Moreover, the Valuation Report did not list all the assets owned by SHGCC – these included a large vessel called <span class="font-italic">Columbus</span> that was worth a substantial sum of money. In re-examination, Gilbert added that there were two other vessels belonging to SHGCC which had not been listed as its assets in the valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Gilbert’s attention was drawn to the letters concerning subdivision. The first letter was dated 27 July 2007

</div> authorising the surrender of the land title for the subdivision and conversion exercise did not go further to explain the purpose of the subdivision and conversion. She added that she and M&amp;A did not find any other resolutions passed by SHGCC that authorised the disposal or transfer of ownership of any part of the Sembulan Land or the Subject Land. She noted from the title deed that the approved purpose of the Sembulan Land was for erecting a “tourist complex” – the construction of the Co-Gen Facility was not part of the approved purpose. Consequently, she deposed that it was reasonably concluded that SHGCC’s application for subdivision and conversion was to regularise the Sembulan Land to accommodate the Co-Gen Facility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Madeline deposed that she had also looked into the various charges that were found in the records that she checked. Amongst them was a charge from SHGCC in favour of Maybank for a loan of RM118,250,000 extended to PHSB on 15 June 1999, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the RM118.25m loan. SHGCC had given this charge as a third party charge on behalf of PHSB, as reflected in a directors’ resolution of SHGCC dated 18 November 1998; this was not uncommon practice and did not indicate that PHSB had any proprietary interest in the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Madeline deposed that she was not given and did not have sight of the letter dated 16 June 1999 from Maybank addressed to Bank Islam stating that the former, as the lender to SHGCC and PHSB, recognised the latter’s rights under a lease agreement dated 16 June 1999 between the latter and PHSB in relation to the ownership of the Co-Gen Facility. Maybank stated that it specifically excluded the Co-Gen Facility and the Subject Land from the ambit of Maybank’s charge dated 7 October 1998. Madeline and M&amp;A also did not have sight of a letter dated 16 January 2013 from Bank Islam to SHGCC

</div> requesting a copy of LSDS’s Amended Offer to SHGCC pursuant to SHGCC’s application for subdivision and conversion. The request was premised on Bank Islam having an interest in the Subject Land due to a letter of undertaking from SHGCC to execute a charge over the Subject Land in favour of Bank Islam. Having reviewed the letter, however, Madeline deposed that nothing was said about PHSB having any proprietary interest in the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Madeline and M&amp;A were aware at the time the due diligence exercise was being conducted that PHSB was already in liquidation. When they requested from WLK statements of accounts relating to the Maybank and Bank Islam loans, WLK said the documents were with the Liquidators of PHSB. Madeline testified she and M&amp;A never received those statements of accounts. Madeline pointed out that if indeed PHSB had a proprietary interest in the Subject Land as the Defendant asserted, the Liquidators would have known and asserted such an interest on behalf of PHSB as part of their duty to collect and realise all the assets of PHSB.  She surmised that since the Liquidators did not at any time assert that PHSB had a proprietary interest in the Sembulan Land or the Subject Land, it must mean that PHSB did not have any such interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 During cross-examination, Ms Sharmini Selvaratnam (“Ms Selva”) drew Madeline’s attention to the Valuation Report, where it clearly stated that the Sembulan Land is 95.58 hectares after deducting the area of the substations on the Subject Land, indicating that the Subject Land was therefore excluded from the valuation. Madeline’s response was that she did not know the basis of the valuation – she was not looking at the valuation as her focus was on legal due diligence. She had only looked at the Valuation Report to check what encumbrances were on the Sembulan Land, not for the valuation itself. In any case, the Valuation Report was prepared in 2013, well before GSH entered the scene. Neither did the Valuation Report tell her that SHGCC did not own the land on which the substations were built or that the substations did not belong to SHGCC. Further, the Valuation Report valued some, not all, of the assets of SHGCC. Ultimately, Madeline said she relied on land search results rather than the Valuation Report as conclusive evidence of the ownership of the Sembulan Land. Hence, the Valuation Report “doesn’t mean anything”

</div> the Plaintiff’s last witness and the CFO of GSH, was in overall charge of the due diligence exercise (working together with the financial and legal due diligence teams) as well as the finalization of the terms of the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In his AEIC, Alex pointed out that the Valuation Report (upon which the Defendant placed so much reliance) was not a document that GSH requested and was not a document prepared for the acquisition. He had only glanced at it to get a general idea of the value of SHGCC at the October 2013 meeting when the Defendant’s team handed it over.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Alex deposed that in the days leading up to the signing of the SA, there were heavy negotiations between the Defendant and GSH/the Plaintiff relating to its terms. There were lengthy meetings held at SH Resort attended by the Defendant, WLK, Francis and himself.  At these meetings, neither the Defendant nor WLK raised any issues regarding Schedule 4 of the SA (see [41] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 At the time when the SA was signed, no one in GSH/the Plaintiff was aware that PHSB, OBSB or any other person had or was claiming any interest in the Subject Land. Neither did the Defendant disclose in writing to GSH/the Plaintiff that any person had any beneficial interest in any part of the Sembulan Land apart from SHGCC. On the contrary, the Defendant had specifically warranted that the whole of the Sembulan Land was legally and beneficially owned by SHGCC under para 18.2 of Schedule 2 of the SA (see [40] above) read with Schedule 4. Further, under cl 6.1 of the SA, the representations and warranties in the SA were to hold true and be accurate as at the date of the SA (30 December 2013) and as at completion (26 March 2014). In addition, the Defendant had provided the Plaintiff with the Disclosure Letter, which did not refer to the S&amp;P, the Transaction, or the fact that any party claimed an interest in the Subject Land (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Alex deposed that that the due diligence exercise did not reveal any documents or information that showed the Defendant’s intention to transfer the Subject Land to PHSB or OBSB or any other person following the subdivision of the Sembulan Land. He added that the Plaintiff was unaware of the S&amp;P (see [10] above) which Alex alleged was prepared and executed surreptitiously without the knowledge and consent of GSH or the Plaintiff. Because of the thousands of transactions which took place for the business of SH Resort, Alex deposed that he did not know or notice that SHGCC had not been receiving rent from the Co-Gen Facility for the occupation of the Subject Land since October 2013. This was also because the amount of rent was insignificant in comparison to the revenue received from SH Resort’s business. Further, no one had highlighted to him that rent for the Subject Land had not been received by SHGCC since October 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Alex referred to the valuation report that was prepared after completion of the SA by Azmi &amp; Co dated 2 September 2014 (“the 2014 Valuation Report”).

</div> This was prepared at the request of the auditors for the purpose of assessing whether there were any impairments of the book value of SHGCC’s assets. At the request of Azmi &amp; Co, a copy of the Valuation Report was extended to them. Azmi &amp; Co relied on the Valuation Report to prepare the 2014 Valuation Report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Alex deposed that he discovered the existence of the S&amp;P in mid-2015 during the review by Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) of SHGCC’s accounts. E&amp;Y chanced upon an entry in the said accounts which recorded a gain of RM1,000. E&amp;Y queried Dickson Chong (“Dickson”), the person in charge of the accounts for the SH Group, who said he was unaware of the particular entry. Dickson investigated and traced the entry to the S&amp;P, which copy he found in the files in the office. He then brought the S&amp;P to the attention of E&amp;Y and Alex.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Upon further inquiry, Alex ascertained that WLK had handled the S&amp;P and the Transaction.  The S&amp;P was executed on behalf of SHGCC by its former directors while the Defendant and WLK executed it on behalf of OBSB.  After execution, WLK bypassed Dickson and handed the S&amp;P directly to one Joanne, the finance manager of SHGCC, to book the entry into the accounts of SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 E&amp;Y highlighted to Alex that the S&amp;P attracted real property gains tax and advised that a real property gains tax return should have been filed within 60 days of the S&amp;P but it was not. That meant that SHGCC could be liable to a penalty of three times the determined amount of real property gain tax, which could be a significant amount if the market value of the Subject Land was used for computation in the event that it was found not to be a transaction at arm’s length. The directors of SHGCC could also be charged and fined or jailed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Alex deposed that his immediate focus was to avoid prosecution of the directors of SHGCC and the imposition of tax penalties. Consequently, SHGCC took steps to immediately file the real property gains tax return with the authorities and then seek an indemnity from the Defendant for any tax liability arising thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 After informing Gilbert, Alex then prepared a letter for the Plaintiff (which Gilbert signed) to the Defendant dated 4 September 2015

The Plaintiff went on to give notice under cl 8A.2 of the SA and alleged that the Defendant had breached cl 7.2(b) and as well as paras 4.1(c), 6.2(a), 6.3(a)(i), 6.4(b), 6.6(b), 11.1 and 11.2 of Schedule 2 therein, which were to hold true up to completion by virtue of cl 6.1 of the SA.

</div> E&amp;Y were instructed not to proceed to file the real property gains tax return as the Plaintiff took the stand that the S&amp;P was not an arm’s length transaction and was void. The Plaintiff’s solicitors also gave notice that it would not sell or transfer the Subject Land to OBSB. The Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote a separate letter to the Defendant on the same day which contents were similar to the letter to OBSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Alex subsequently discovered from the Malaysian Suit that the S&amp;P had been executed on 21 March 2014 but was backdated to 1 March 2014 on the instructions of WLK to the solicitor, Timothy Soo from the law firm of Jayasuriya Kah &amp; Co (“JK&amp;C”) who had drafted the document. He further ascertained that tenancy agreements had been signed between SHGCC and PHSB since 2001 for occupation by PHSB of the Subject Land where the Co-Gen Facility was located. Under the last tenancy agreement dated 1 December 2012, the monthly rent was RM5,558. SHGCC had charged rent until January 2014 by way of debit notes. However, the debit note for January 2014 was subsequently cancelled and a credit note was raised on or about 24 January 2014 to reverse the effect of the debit notes rendered by SHGCC from October to December 2013. This was done after the SA was signed but before completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Alex had also become aware that SHGCC had issued a prospectus dated 27 December 2012 (“the Prospectus”) to the public for the issuance of preference shares in the company. In the Prospectus, SHGCC was clearly stated to be the owner of the Sembulan Land, including the Subject Land.  In the subsequent prospectuses issued by SHGCC and dated 29 January and 30 June 2014 respectively, the same statement appeared.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As Alex was questioned on the Valuation Report and 2014 Valuation Report by Mr Lem on the same basis as Gilbert and Madeline, the court deems it unnecessary to review that aspect of his evidence in detail. The nub of Mr Lem’s questions centred on the area of the Sembulan Land stated in the two reports.  In the Valuation Report, the net land area was stated to be 94.90 hectares or 234.50 acres after deducting areas for substations. In the 2014 Valuation Report however, the area of the Sembulan Land was stated to be 95.58 hectares or 236.18 acres; the difference was 1.68 hectares.  On 8 January 2016,

</div> Azmi &amp; Co issued an amended certificate of valuation correcting the area of the Sembulan Land from 95.58 to 94.90 hectares consistent with that stated in the Valuation Report. Mr Lem stated (with which Alex disagreed) that the Plaintiff never took issue with the land area of 94.90 hectares because it knew the Subject Land was never part of SHGCC’s assets.  The court notes here that it was in evidence that for both valuation reports, it was the Defendant or the Defendant’s office who informed both CH Williams and Azmi &amp; Co that the area of land for valuation was or should be 94.90 hectares.  No independent survey of the Sembulan Land was conducted by either valuer. Given that the stated area was entirely based on the Defendant’s own reporting, the probative value of these reports was minimal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Lem went further to question Alex on the inclusion of the Valuation Report in the financial statements of SHGCC for 2014 and subsequent years. Alex pointed out that preparation of the financial statements of SHGCC for 2014, which reflected the revaluation exercise in 2013, would have been under the charge of WLK from the previous management. In fact, it is of little or no consequence to the court whether the yearly accounts of SHGCC referred to the Valuation Report or to the 2014 Valuation Report as there were shortcomings in both valuations and this issue was not directly relevant to the dispute at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The court turns to other aspects of Alex’s cross-examination which have a direct bearing on the issues to be decided in this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Alex’s attention was drawn to Bank Islam’s letter dated 21 March 2013

</div> addressed to the Liquidators. The Defendant informed the Liquidators that he had reached a settlement with Bank Islam, that the settlement sum of RM33.6m would be paid by OBSB and that this sum represented the purchase price of the power plant and machinery of PHSB (collectively “the Assets”) located at the Co-Generation Facility. The Defendant stated he nominated OBSB as the buyer to enter into the sale and purchase agreement with PHSB. This agreement became the ASA executed on 12 July 2013 (see [15] above). The Defendant added that the sale and purchase would <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> the Subject Land for which OBSB would enter into a separate agreement with the landowner, SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Mr Lem reminded Alex of the judgment in the Malaysian Suit that upheld the Common Expectation that PHSB (and its successor OBSB) would be entitled to possession and ownership of the Subject Land and the Co-Gen Facility because of money PHSB had expended on the development of the Co-Gen Facility. Mr Lem said the S&amp;P was regarded as a mere formality by the Defendant, as pleaded in the Defence which adopted the language of the judgment in the Malaysian Suit, and, contrary to Alex’s allegation, the Defendant did not deliberately hide the S&amp;P from the Plaintiff; Alex unsurprisingly disagreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the various prospectuses that SHGCC issued (see [102] above) which were reviewed by M&amp;A, Mr Lem sought to convince Alex (who disagreed) that the purpose of those documents was to determine the reciprocal and affiliation agreements that were entered into by SHGCC for its members to use facilities of 36 other clubs and to make available such agreements for inspection by its members.  No evidence in this regard was presented by the Defendant and the court accordingly disregards the Defendant’s explanation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Defendant was the first witness for his defence. His AEIC was lengthy resulting in his cross-examination taking three days. Most of the facts set out in his AEIC have been canvassed with the Plaintiff’s witnesses and it is not necessary to repeat them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In his AEIC, the Defendant set out the genesis of the SH Resort which he had started constructing in the early 1990s, with the Co-Gen Facility being built between 1997 and 1999. The Defendant deposed at length as to all the financial institutions and financial instruments that he and/or his companies, including the SH Group, dealt with from the time of or before construction of the SH Resort commenced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Throughout his AEIC, the Defendant repeatedly referred to the Common Expectation that PHSB had that it would own the Subject Land because it had expended RM155m to develop the Co-Gen Facility situated thereon. This issue will be dealt with in greater detail below (see [135]–[138]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Defendant referred to numerous banking and other documentation which were generated before GSH and the Plaintiff came into the picture.  Amongst such documents was a letter from Bank Islam to KPMG dated 12 March 2012 (after PHSB had gone into liquidation on 11 January 2012) giving notice that under Bank Islam’s Debenture (see [84] above), Bank Islam as a secured lender had an interest over the assets of PHSB including the Subject Land. Bank Islam had given a similar notice on the same day to MTB. Both these letters were copied to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, Maybank and SHGCC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The US$24m loan (referred to in [84] above) to PHSB had been secured by the Defendant’s personal guarantee as well as the pledge of his 51% shares in SH Holdings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 During cross-examination, the Defendant admitted that by 2012, the SH Group was in serious financial difficulties and was owing loan stockholders almost RM2 billion. In some cases, the loans extended to his companies, including PHSB, were secured by the Defendant’s personal guarantees and/or the pledge of his shares in various companies including SH Holdings. In fact, a winding up petition was ultimately filed against SH Holdings. More will be said of the winding up proceedings below (at [134]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Consequently from early 2013, the Defendant desperately looked for investors to save SH Group as well as himself from financial ruin. He found his white knight in GSH, which then worked through the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff’s investment of RM700m into the Sutera Target Group was used to settle all of the outstanding indebtedness due to the SH Group’s bondholders as well as the loans of Maybank and Bank Islam. As a result of the Plaintiff’s investment, the Defendant not only paid off all the loans owed by him and or his various companies but he also walked away with a windfall of RM127m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 During cross-examination, the Defendant agreed that he did not state in his AEIC that he had told Goi that the <span class="font-italic">land</span> on which the Co-Gen Facility was located, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the Subject Land, was not for sale.

He agreed that on 28 December 2013, the day when the SA was signed at SH Resort after last minute amendments were made to the document, neither he nor WLK informed the GSH representatives that PHSB or OBSB owned the proprietary interest in the Subject Land. Further, no amendment was made to the statement that SHGCC was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the whole of the Sembulan Land, stated to be “95.58 hectares”, which included the Subject Land.

Even at that stage, the Defendant did not state he wanted the Subject Land to be excluded from the sale. He agreed that on hindsight he should have done so. He repeated his defence that PHSB was the then owner of the Subject Land and the S&amp;P was only a formality. He maintained he made a mistake and it was his oversight in not informing his solicitors of the need to amend Schedule 4 (see [41] above) to exclude the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It is noteworthy that in cross-examination, the Defendant agreed that not only did he not inform the Plaintiff’s representatives or Goi or M&amp;A/Madeline that the Subject Land was not part of the sale or that the Subject Land would be transferred to OBSB, he did not at any time instruct WLK to inform the Plaintiff either.

The Defendant claimed it was on KPMG’s advice at the time that he had settled the US$24m loan from Bank Islam, and that KPMG had told him that PHSB did not have legal title to the Subject Land at the time the ASA was executed (see [15] above). As the Liquidators therefore could not transfer the Subject Land to OBSB, KPMG recommended to him that a separate sale and purchase agreement should be prepared.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Defendant agreed that Zarazilah and Foo who signed the S&amp;P as directors on behalf of SHGCC were also appointed by him as directors of OBSB. Ms Teh had described these two directors of SHGCC as the Defendant’s “cronies” who had known him for a long time and who would sign whatever the Defendant wanted. The Defendant disagreed. He denied that the execution of the S&amp;P was done surreptitiously and, even if it were, then WLK and JK&amp;C were responsible.  He again described the S&amp;P as a “housekeeping” issue, according to his understanding from WLK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Ms Teh put to the Defendant that the execution of the S&amp;P and its concealment from the Plaintiff was not his only dishonest action. As part of the acquisition of SH Group, it had been agreed that the non-trade debts owed to the Defendant’s companies amounting to around RM8.78m were to be waived. However, it was discovered that the Defendant had transferred monies from SH Resort to his own companies as repayment of some of those debts. On 13 February 2014, Alex and Gilbert had attended a meeting with the Defendant and WLK where WLK confirmed that such payments had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The Defendant was questioned on the repayment of intercompany debts owed to the Defendant’s companies, <span class="font-italic">viz</span> Sutera Sanctuary Lodges (“SSL”) and Kinabalu Nature Resorts Sdn Bhd. The RM5.8m paid to SSL included non-trade debt of RM2.8m. The Defendant therefore had to refund SH Resort RM2,832,000. The Defendant’s conduct prompted the Plaintiff/GSH to have PriceWaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) station staff at SH Resort to monitor payments being disbursed from the office. In cross-examination, the Defendant insisted he did not have to repay the RM2,832,000. When the court queried why then did he do it, the Defendant gave a convoluted explanation

This was reflected in the winding up petitions that were filed against SH Holdings and PHSB. While PHSB was eventually wound up, the Defendant managed to stave off the winding up petition filed by MTB against SH Holdings on 29 January 2013. The sums for which the winding up petition was filed against SH Holdings exceeded RM1.5 billion (as stated in the board resolution of SH Resort dated 26 February 2014

The Defendant’s reply was that OBSB bought over from Bank Islam all the rights of PHSB including the Subject Land by way of the ASA and therefore inherited PHSB’s rights. The Defendant repeatedly said that OBSB “stepped into the shoes of PHSB”, which the court told him was a misconception on his part.

The Co-Gen Facility was apparently built out of necessity. The Defendant disclosed that when he was developing SH Resort in its early days, he was told by SESB that there was not enough power to be supplied to the resort. There were outages and frequent blackouts. The Defendant told SESB that a five-star resort could not operate with such frequent blackouts. Hence, he proposed building a power plant with SESB’s consent and the government’s permission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Due to its financial difficulties, PHSB stopped generating electricity in 2002 and SESB took over. Subsequently when PHSB resumed operations, it no longer supplied electricity directly to the SH Resort but to SESB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The evidence adduced also showed that the Malaysian court was not apprised of the banking facilities and/or financial arrangements of PHSB which would have had a bearing on its determination of the existence of the Common Expectation. In particular, the fact that Sutera Target Group companies, and not PHSB, had paid for the Co-Gen Facility was not disclosed to the Malaysian court.

</div> She said it was PHSB that was beholden to SHGCC and not <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. The Defendant’s explanation for his actions was that in 1999 he was fighting for his survival due to the Asian financial crisis. He lost RM450m overnight as he had borrowed US$330m with the exchange rate at RM1.254 to US$1.00 which rate rose to RM4–4.20 to US$1.00 causing his debt to balloon to more than RM1 billion. That was probably why the Defendant’s and his companies’ total indebtedness to their lenders was in the region of RM2 billion; the total debt included the RM118.25m loan which had ballooned to RM233m by March 2009.  With respect, however, the court does not see the relevance of the 1998–1999 Asian financial crisis to the Defendant’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The evidence produced by the Plaintiff also showed that PHSB could not have been incorporated for the purpose of developing the Co-Gen Facility as the Defendant claimed. The Defendant had bought it as a shelf company. PHSB was incorporated on 16 October 1993 and it was not known at the time that the Co-Gen Facility would be needed.

The Defendant acknowledged that these properties would have been affected by the inadequacy of the electricity supply in the 1990s. Ms Teh then pointed out that it therefore did not make sense for SHGCC to give PHSB the piece of land for developing the Co-Gen Facility when the electricity was enjoyed by the other properties as well. The Defendant did not provide a clear response, except to suggest that the land was SESB’s all along.

However, the 2007 Valuation Report clearly stated that the valuation was carried out on behalf of Deutsche Bank for the purpose of his securing banking facilities.

WLK’s AEIC was comparable to the Defendant’s in length and her cross-examination was also fairly lengthy. She filed a supplementary AEIC (“SAEIC”) on the first day of the trial which the Plaintiff’s solicitors did not object to, subject to the issue of costs which will be decided by this court in its determination of this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 WLK, a trained accountant was the CFO of SH Holdings, SHGCC and SH Resort for almost 7 years until 31 March 2013 as well as the company secretary of SHGCC until 24 April 2014. She was also the CFO of PHSB from September 2007 until 30 September 2013 and a director and company secretary of OBSB until August 2014 and January 2015 respectively. At the material time, WLK’s work was to oversee the financial operations of the SH Group as well as other companies related to the Defendant including OBSB and PHSB.

The first was at Traders Hotel and the second meeting was at GSH’s office in Changi. She expanded on the two meetings in her AEIC as amended by her SAEIC, focussing on the Valuation Report that she said she handed to GSH’s representatives at the second meeting, which she asserted would have informed the Plaintiff that the Subject Land was expressly excluded from the sale. However, in cross-examination, she confirmed Gilbert’s testimony (see [56] above) that at the second meeting, she merely handed over the Valuation Report and there was no discussion whatsoever on its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 WLK’s AEIC also dealt with the banking facilities granted by Bank Islam to PHSB as well as the meetings and negotiations with the Plaintiff/GSH that led to the execution of the SA as well as the events that took place after the completion of the SA.

She would go through the drafts to check the accuracy of figures or details such as names of companies and addresses but did not concern herself with the actual terms drafted as that was dealt with by the Defendant himself with his solicitor, WA.

The Plaintiff’s representatives from PWC carried out financial due diligence at the office of SH Group for which she would produce management and audited accounts, as and when those documents were required. Sometimes, WLK forwarded to PWC soft copies of documents. She deposed that she also provided documentation relating to the existing liabilities of the Sutera Target Group and its related companies.

She added that when arrangements were being made for PHSB to redeem the Co-Gen Facility from Bank Islam and for OBSB to acquire the same, the Liquidators had informed her that PHSB was unable to sell the Subject Land to OBSB as it did not have title to the Subject Land. The Liquidators suggested that separate arrangements had to be made for the transfer of the Subject Land to OBSB. That was why subsequently, in April 2013, she requested JK&amp;C’s Daniel Tan to draft the S&amp;P for execution by OBSB and SHGCC to formalise the transfer of the Subject Land to OBSB. In this regard, she drafted the letter dated 26 March 2013

She received a draft on 26 February 2014 but only managed to finalise the S&amp;P on 20 March 2014.

Hence, in order to avoid any issues that may arise with the tax department, she had the tenancy agreements prepared for the years from 2007 to 2012. PHSB’s rental expenses would also be tax-deductible.  SHGCC issued debit notes to PBSB for the rent payable. According to her, after OBSB bought the Subject Land from PHSB, no rent was paid to SHGCC. In fact, it was WLK who arranged for SHGCC’s debit notes to be cancelled or for credit notes to be issued, for the months October 2013 to January 2014 as, by October 2013, OBSB had taken possession of the Co-Gen Facility. The court will address this further below at [196].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 In cross-examination by Mr Mark Yeo (“Mr Yeo”), WLK did not agree that the subdivision exercise for the Sembulan Land to excise the Subject Land was only to facilitate charging the Subject Land to Bank Islam.

She added that since she was not asked, she did not provide a copy of the S&amp;P to Madeline. Her answer was absurd – as Mr Yeo pointed out, the due diligence team would not ask for a document they did not know existed. WLK then changed her testimony to say she did not provide the S&amp;P as it was not yet signed at the time the due diligence was being conducted.

</div> Yet, she gave instructions for the reversal in January 2014 even though the S&amp;P had not been signed then. Further, the fact was that the Subject Land had been excluded from the ASA. She claimed that it never occurred to her that her actions were unfair to the Plaintiff as an investor who would be putting RM700m into the SH group. WLK drew a distinction between OBSB and PHSB, which previously paid rent, on the basis that PHSB had charged the Subject Land to Bank Islam and it had not redeemed the charge. This was, however, an irrelevant distinction in terms of the payment of rent – PHSB continued to pay rent when the charge had not been redeemed, and it was not clear to the court how the redemption of the charge would mean that OBSB did not need to pay rent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chong Choon Kim’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Nothing turns on the testimony of the valuer, Chong, in relation to the Valuation Report

</div> LSDS removed the two restrictions in its previous two letters of offer namely, that the subdivision was only for the purpose of erecting an electricity substation by SESB and that transfer and/or sublease was prohibited except to SESB. The only condition that remained was that the subdivision of title was prohibited except with written permission from the Director of Lands and Surveys. LSDS also converted the use of the Subject Land to “Industrial (Co-Gen Plant)”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 The endorsement of receipt by LSDS showed that SHGCC’s letter was only hand-delivered to LSDS on 12 February 2014, which was one day <span class="font-italic">after </span>GSH deposited RM70m with MTB as a precondition for the adjournment of the winding up hearing against SH Holdings, which had been fixed for 12 February 2014.

According to the Defendant, the different treatment of SHGCC’s third charge would have told the Plaintiff that the third charge involved PHSB and that although SHGCC owns the Sembulan Land, it could not give a third party charge of the Subject Land as security insofar as the other transactions did not involve PHSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The Defendant then addressed Madeline’s testimony (see [82] above) that PHSB was only an “occupier” of the Subject Land at the material time. He submitted that if PHSB only had the status of a “tenant”, there would have been no need for MTB to give an undertaking to disclaim all of its “rights, interest and benefits” over the Subject Land and MTB would not have required PHSB’s agreement to present and register the SHGCC charges on behalf of SH Resort and SH Holdings. It would also not have been necessary for MTB to issue the Letter of Disclaimer to PHSB if SHGCC owned the Subject Land. Further, the Plaintiff and M&amp;A/Madeline knew that PHSB’s interest in the Co-Gen Facility was not that of a tenant or occupier only – it was its owner and operator.

The court does not accept this argument for the reasons set out at [258]–[265] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 The issues that arise for determination in this case are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the Defendant withhold the existence of the S&amp;P from the Plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was there a Common Expectation between SHGCC and PHSB as the Defendant alleged in his Defence, so as to entitle the Defendant to the declaration prayed for in his Counterclaim?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Did PHSB have proprietary interest in the Subject Land which it then conveyed to OBSB?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Was the Malaysian court misled by the Defendant in the Malaysian Suit? As a corollary, does the judgment in the Malaysian Suit give rise to issue estoppel against the Plaintiff and is this Suit is an abuse of process as the Defendant contends?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Did the Defendant breach any or all of the warranties pleaded in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim and set out at [37] to [41] above?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 Before turning to the specific findings in this case, the court considers the credibility of the witnesses. Unlike the Plaintiff’s four witnesses who testified in a forthright manner without hesitation, the Defendant’s stock answers during cross-examination when he found himself in difficulties – “I can’t remember”, “I don’t know”, “It was my mistake” and “I overlooked” – did not persuade the court he was a truthful witness. On her part, WLK would seek to excuse herself whenever she declined to answer counsel’s questions, when those answers would have incriminated her, by stating “I can’t remember”. The court was not impressed with her veracity either. Chong, the valuer, was the Defendant’s only truthful witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 It can be seen from Annexure A that the Defendant had a penchant for using BVI companies to hide his shareholdings in his stable of Malaysian companies. One example would be Investasia. That company is wholly owned by Asia Impel (now known as Xing Asia Impel Sdn Bhd) which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mainfield Holdings Ltd, a BVI company. As for OBSB, OBSB’s shareholder is yet another BVI company, MDS International Limited.  When cross-examined by Ms Teh as to why he used so many BVI companies for his businesses, the Defendant gave the incredible answer, “I don’t know really”,

Under the Sutera Letter of Undertaking, SHGCC agreed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to execute a charge in favour of Bank Islam over the Subject Land after subdivision (see [150] above).  It therefore does not lie in the Defendant’s mouth to contend that the Plaintiff had no part in repaying PHSB’s debts when he made full use of a company in the Sutera Target Group, namely SHGCC, to either provide collateral or to make payment to Maybank (and Bank Islam) to discharge PHSB’s liabilities.

It further showed the great lengths that Defendant and/or WLK went to in order to hide the execution and the existence of the S&amp;P from the Plaintiff, who discovered the document by chance in the records of SH Resort when E&amp;Y reviewed the accounts of SHGCC (see [94] above). It was therefore clear that the Defendant had hidden the existence of the S&amp;P from the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Despite his denials, the court has no doubt that the Defendant’s instructions to JK&amp;C in April 2013 to prepare a sale and purchase agreement were prompted by the fact that he was meeting prospective investors. If those investors had invested in SHGCC, he wanted to carve out the Subject Land and transfer it out to either PHSB or OBSB. As nothing resulted from the discussions with those prospective investors, the Defendant put the intended transfer on hold and did not chase JK&amp;C since there was no urgency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 The urgency resurfaced when the Plaintiff/GSH executed the Term Sheet on 18 October 2013 followed by the SA on 30 December 2013. The Defendant was then galvanised into action to get the S&amp;P signed and the Subject Land transferred out of SHGCC’s ownership before completion of the SA on 26 March 2014, and which he did surreptitiously on 24 March 2014.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The proprietary interest of PHSB in the Subject Land</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 The court finds that PHSB did not have a proprietary interest in the Subject Land. The Defendant had alleged that the Liquidators knew of PHSB’s alleged proprietary interest in the Subject Land at the time the ASA was executed and had advised him to have a separate sale and purchase agreement to formalise that interest (see [107] above). In the first place, this did not make sense – if the Liquidators knew that PHSB had a propriety interest in the Subject Land, a sale and purchase agreement involving only SHGCC and OBSB would not have been the appropriate means of vesting that interest in OBSB. In any case, the Defendant’s evidence is undermined by his own letter dated 26 March 2013 addressed to the Liquidators.

As the Defendant conceded in cross-examination, the so-called “Common Expectation” was in fact simply a plan that he had hatched and then sought to implement through his various companies (see [135] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 It follows from the above finding that the Defendant’s defence (see [47(f)] above) that OBSB would suffer a detriment if the Common Expectation is dishonoured or denied or reneged upon is unsustainable and unfounded. Indeed, it is absurd as the Defendant would be making the representation on behalf of himself as SGHCC and to himself again on behalf of PHSB/OBSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 In any case, there could not have been the Common Expectation alleged as PHSB never paid the construction loan used to build the Co-Gen Facility, which was an essential element of PHSB’s alleged reliance on that Common Expectation. Neither did OBSB pay the consideration of RM33.6m to the Liquidators of PHSB under the ASA as the sum was paid by Asia Impel from a loan advanced by the SD Bank who was misled as to the purpose of the loan (see [159] above). Hence, OBSB as well had not relied on the Common Expectation to its detriment at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 The Defendant had pleaded in his (amended) Defence and Counterclaim (at paras 9(3) and 10) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was then understood between SHGCC and PHSB that the latter would develop and operate the Co-Generation Facility on the Subject Land to supply all the power that the [SH Resort] required…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In reasonable reliance on the Common Expectation, OBSB – with the knowledge, acquiescence and/or encouragement of SHGCC – planned, decided and then carried out various actions that are required …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, PHSB could not have placed reliance on the “knowledge, acquiescence and/or encouragement of SHGCC” in any case because in his own AEIC at para 26, the Defendant deposed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The development of the Co-Generation Facility on the Subject Land proceeded with the common expectation and assurance between SHGCC and PHSB, that the entity that developed the Subject Land with the Co-Generation Facility would occupy and own it. <span class="font-italic">At the material time, both SHGCC and PHSB were under my directorship and general management</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Again the Defendant was wearing two hats at one and the same time and the understanding was with himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 In his Defence, the Defendant also dwelt at great length

</div> on the alleged reliance by OBSB on what it was led to believe by SHGCC, highlighting how the Co-Gen Facility came to be constructed by PHSB, explaining the attendant approval(s) and/or requisite licence(s) from the relevant government authorities, the financing from banks and SHGCC’s involvement in the financing arrangements (by providing SGHCC’s Letter of Undertaking and giving a third-party charge). However, none of those facts actually involved OBSB. Indeed, they could not have involved OBSB because the company only came into existence on 7 February 2013, when it was incorporated (see [10] above).  As noted above at [137], the Defendant repeatedly claimed that OBSB had stepped into PHSB’s shoes, but this argument was lacking in specificity and without substance. The Defendant’s broad references to OBSB purchasing PHSB’s rights also did not make sense given the scope of the ASA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 The Defendant relied on Madeline’s evidence set out at [81]–[82] and [216] above for his submission that she acknowledged PHSB’s ownership of the Subject Land. That is a misreading of her testimony. Madeline consistently maintained that whatever documents she saw described PHSB was an “occupier” not “owner” of the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In the court’s judgment, the Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff of the alleged Common Expectation between PHSB and SHGCC because it never existed. It was his contrived defence in the Malaysian Suit.  It was undoubtedly concocted well after the Defendant’s letter dated 6 October 2015

Goi’s testimony (which the Defendant appeared to accept and rely upon) was that he understood and accepted that the <span class="font-italic">business</span> of the Co-Gen Facility was not included in the sale, but nothing was said about the <span class="font-italic">land </span>upon which the Co-Gen Facility was located.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 The court finds it strange that the banking institutions from whom the Defendant borrowed enormous sums were so trusting that they accepted his word that PHSB owned the Subject Land without requiring any proof. That comment applies equally to Chong and the valuer(s) from Azmi &amp; Co who were prepared to accept at face value the Defendant’s statement that SHGCC’s Sembulan Land had an area of 94.90 and not 95.58 hectares without verifying the information themselves. Regardless, these aspects of the evidence did not suggest that the Defendant’s allegations had any merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 Therefore, the court finds that there was no Common Expectation as alleged by the Defendant.

It is the court’s view that the Malaysian court was indeed misled by the Defendant due to the Defendant’s withholding of the facts stated at [256] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does the judgment in the Malaysian Suit give rise to issue estoppel against the Plaintiff and is this Suit an abuse of process?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 As stated earlier, the gravamen of the Defendant’s defence was his contention that the Malaysian Judgment was good against the world on the basis of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and that the international comity of nations requires this court to give it due recognition. To determine this issue, the court turn to consider some of the authorities cited by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 In the first place, as the Defendant is pleading <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>arising out of a foreign judgment, the court first considers whether the foreign judgment ought to be recognised. In <span class="font-italic">Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1322 (“<span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>”), the court held at [65]–[67] that recognition of a foreign judgment is a necessary prerequisite for it to give rise to <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> before our courts either through cause of action or issue estoppel or the so-called “extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span>” by virtue of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 According to <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67], under the common law, a foreign judgment will be recognised if: (i) it is a final and conclusive judgment of a court which, (ii) according to the private international law of Singapore, had jurisdiction to grant the judgment and (iii) if there is no defence to its recognition. Granted requirements (i) and (ii) are satisfied here, but it is the court’s view that requirement (iii) is not. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> at [73], quoting from <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 75.209, one ground for not giving effect to a foreign judgment under requirement (iii) is “if the foreign judgment had been obtained by fraud or in breach of principles of natural justice”. In this case, the Malaysian court was deceived because of the fraudulent conduct of the Defendant encapsulated in his transferring the Subject Land (worth at least RM250,000 at market value according to the Plaintiff) to OBSB for a nominal RM1,000, and in then withholding key facts from the Malaysian court (see [256]-–[257] above) which would have been detrimental to his defence in the Malaysian Suit. This is sufficient to dispose of the Defendant’s arguments on estoppel and <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 Even if the Malaysian Judgment should be recognised, no issue estoppel would arise. It should first be noted that the issues litigated before the Malaysian court and in this court are different. As set out above at [28], SHGCC had disputed OBSB’s ownership of the Subject Land in the Malaysian Suit and the reliefs that it claimed included a declaration that the S&amp;P was null and void and SHGCC remained the owner of the Subject Land. In this Suit, the Plaintiff’s (not SHGCC’s) claim against the Defendant is for breach of various warranties that he provided in the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 For issue estoppel to apply on the basis that litigants should not be twice vexed in the same matter, the law requires the following four conditions to be satisfied (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 at [14]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there is a final and conclusive judgment on the merits;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the judgment was given by a court of competent jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there is an identity of parties; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) there is identity of subject matter in the two proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In this case criteria (c) and (d) are missing as the plaintiffs and the disputes in the two sets of proceedings are different, notwithstanding that the Defendant is the common defendant in both suits.

</div> In the Malaysian Suit, SHGCC’s cause of action against the Defendant was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for breach of the fiduciary duties he owed to SHGCC as its director while OBSB was joined as his co-defendant on the basis it was privy to such breach. The dispute related to the Defendant’s conduct in effecting a transfer of the Subject Land to OBSB by SHGCC. In addition, the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">lex situs</span> in conflict of laws states that the law governing the transfer of title to immoveable property is dependent upon the location of the property. In the present case, even where it touches upon the Subject Land, the Plaintiff’s rights against the Defendant are personal to it, since they are contractual rights that govern the Defendant’s conduct <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Plaintiff. Therefore, the Defendant has not in fact been sued twice over on the same issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the Defendant breach all or any of the warranties pleaded in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Without a doubt, in the light of the court’s many findings set out earlier, the Defendant did indeed breach the warranties pleaded by the Plaintiff and set out at [37] to [42] above. To reiterate, under cl 6.1 of the SA, the Defendant had provided the warranties under Schedule 2, and these warranties were to be true and accurate at the date of the SA and at the date of completion of the SA, as if they were given afresh on such later date. In this case, the S&amp;P for the transfer of the Subject Land to OBSB was signed on 21 March 2014 and backdated to 1 March 2014, while completion of the SA was on 26 March 2014. The court has already found that PHSB did not have a proprietary interest in the subject land, and therefore, the Subject Land was part of the acquisition under the SA and the S&amp;P was a disposition of SHGCC’s land. On the basis of the findings of fact above, the court finds that the Defendant has breached cl 6.1 of the SA by reason of the following breaches of warranties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Defendant had breached paras 4.1(c) and 4.1(g) of Schedule 2 by disposing of the Subject Land under the S&amp;P to OBSB. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendant had breached paras 6.6(b), 11.1, and 11.2(a) of Schedule 2 by disposing of the Subject Land at a price lower than its market value, and certainly not on an arm’s length basis as the Defendant was also a director of OBSB. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendant had breached para 18.2 of Schedule 2 (read with Schedule 4) as OBSB had obtained an interest in the Subject Land under the S&amp;P, and therefore, the statement in Schedule 2 that SHGCC was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Sembulan Land (which includes the Subject Land) was false at the time of completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is worth noting that of these warranties, only para 11.1 of Schedule 2 makes express reference to disclosure. The crux of the case concerning disclosure has to do with the limitation of liability clause in the SA. For the reasons that will be discussed in relation to that clause, the court finds that the Defendant cannot rely on that proviso in relation to para 11.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 The Defendant claimed that he was entitled to rely on the limitation of liability clause under cl 8A.1(c)(i) of the SA, such that he would not be liable for any claim by the Plaintiff. In order to establish this, he had to show that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the fact, matter, event or circumstance giving rise to such Claim … had been disclosed to the Investors in the Disclosure Letter as a potential liability of or loss to any of the companies in the Sutera Target Group …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 The Disclosure Letter did not make express reference to the S&amp;P or Transaction. Further, the court has found the Plaintiff would not have known about the S&amp;P or Transaction. Given the finding that PHSB never had a proprietary interest in the Subject Land, it also followed that this could not have been disclosed. Therefore, in order to rely on the limitation of liability clause, the Defendant had to show that the Disclosure Letter was somehow sufficient to disclose the existence of the S&amp;P.  Earlier at [219] above, I had alluded to the Defendant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([219] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) for his submission that general disclosure by the Defendant sufficed. Not surprisingly, the Plaintiff in its reply submissions

The Plaintiff pointed out that in that case, the English Court of Appeal (which dismissed the buyer’s appeal) distinguished the earlier case of <span class="font-italic">New Hearts Ltd v Cosmopolitan Investments Ltd</span> [1997] 2 BCLC 249 (“<span class="font-italic">New Hearts</span>”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 The facts in <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mea Corporation Limited (“Mea”) as purchaser and Artisan Contracting Ltd (“Artisan”) as vendor entered into the share sale agreement on 24 May 2001. Mea’s rights and obligations under the share sale agreement were assigned to Infiniteland, who became the purchaser. The target companies were three companies, the most relevant being Bickerton Construction Ltd (“Bickerton”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 7.1.8 of the share sale agreement stated:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Warrantors warrant to the Purchaser that … save as set out in the Disclosure Letter, the Warranties in Schedule 3 are true and accurate in all respects; … </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Paragraph 1.1.2 in Schedule 3 stated a warranty that:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principal accounts (a) give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities of each Group Company at the Last Accounts Date and its profits for the financial period ended on that date; …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Paragraph 3.1.1 in Schedule 3 provided a warranty that all payments which should have been made in respect of taxation had been made.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Clause 7.1.9 of the share sale agreement warranted that the contents of the disclosure letter and of all accompanying documents were true and accurate in all respects and fully, clearly and accurately disclosed every matter to which they related: <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [7].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The disclosure letter was dated the same day as the share sale agreement and was addressed to Mea by Artisan (and a related company, which, for present purposes, is irrelevant): <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [9]. The disclosure letter contained <span class="font-italic">general </span>disclosures as follows (<span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This letter shall be deemed to include, and there are hereby incorporated into it by reference and generally disclosed, the following matters: …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. all matters from the documents and written information supplied by us to your reporting accountants, Pridie Brewster;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. all matters contained or referred to in the following documents supplied by us to you in the green level arch files … (b) Bickerton—board meeting packs for 30 January 2001, 27 February 2001 and 27 March 2001 … and from the board meeting pack[s] for Bickerton for 30 April 2001 … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. all matters contained or referred to in the documents contained in the Disclosure Bundles, a list of which documents is attached to this letter.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The disclosure letter also contained specific disclosures stating, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> (<span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.1.2  In the year ended 31 March 2001, a management charge paid by Bickerton was reversed …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1.1  In the year ending 31 March 2001, Bickerton and Driver made no payments on account of corporation tax because they were not expected to show a profit, but management charges were credited by Artisan, so showing a profit …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The specific disclosures were made in relation to the specific paragraphs in Schedule 3 of the share sale agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the specific disclosure in paragraph 1.1.2 in the disclosure letter corresponded to paragraph 1.1.2 of Schedule 3 in the share sale agreement, and so on.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) It was common ground that the principal accounts of Bickerton did not show “a true and fair view” of Bickerton’s profits for the year ending 31 March 2001. The issue arose because the “Costs of Sales” (which was deducted from the turnover to give the gross profit) had had a sum of £1,081,000 offset against it. It was not disputed that it was not appropriate to deduct the sum of £1,081,000 from the “Costs of Sales” in the profit and loss account: <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [15]. It had the effect of artificially reducing the costs of sales which resulted in showing that an operating profit of about £500,000 was made. If this sum was not deducted from the costs of sales, the accounts would have instead shown an operating loss of about £500,000. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Infiniteland claimed that the warranty in paragraph 1.1.2 of Schedule 3 of the share sale agreement was breached, in that the accounts did not give a true and fair view of Bickerton’s profits for the relevant financial year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 Park J, who heard the case in the first instance, held that the disclosure letter did not make adequate disclosure of the £1,081,000 and by reason of the £1,081,000, the profit and loss account did not give a true and fair view of the relevant company’s profit for the relevant year: <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([219] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [65]. He held that there was a breach of the warranty contained in para 1.1.2 in Schedule 3. While the decision raised other issues, it is sufficient to constrain the analysis of <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> to this issue for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 On appeal, in holding that there was adequate disclosure in the disclosure letter by way of the general disclosure clause, the English Court of Appeal found that Park J had <span class="font-italic">wrongly read </span>into cl 7.1.8 of the share sale agreement the words of cl 7.1.9 of the share sale agreement and <span class="font-italic">then appl</span><span class="font-italic">ied </span>the observations of Lord Penrose in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts </span>to this erroneous reading of cl 7.1.8. Taken on its own terms, cl 7.1.8 of the share sale agreement allowed for disclosure by way of disclosure letter, and there was no warrant to import the requirement stated in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts</span>. As Chadwick LJ held in <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland </span>at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would have been open to the purchase to refuse to accept disclosure made in general terms by reference to what had been supplied to its reporting accountants; and to insist that it would only accept disclosure which was specific to each individual warranty. <span class="font-italic">But the purchase did not choose to take that course.</span> It was content to rely on its reporting accountants to identify from the documents supplied to them – and to report on – the matters about which it needed to be informed. <span class="font-italic">That is the effect of the terms in which disclosure was made under the disclosure letter; and, for whatever reason, those were the terms upon which the purchase was content to accept disclosure</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In those circumstances</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>as it seems to me, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the disclosure requirement was satisfied in relation to such matters as </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">might fairly be expected to come to the knowledge of the reporting accountants from an examination (in the ordinary course of carrying out the due diligence exercise for which they were engaged) of the documents and written information supplied to them (including board meeting packs and the contents of the disclosure bundle).</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 The emphasis in that decision, therefore, was that the adequacy of disclosure in a disclosure letter had to be assessed according to the terms of the specific agreement containing the warranties: <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> at [69]. In arriving at his decision, Park J had relied on the certain observations of Lord Penrose in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([270] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>),<span class="font-italic"> </span>which are set out below, when it was inappropriate to do so given the terms of the share sale agreement in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 The Plaintiff submitted that this court should instead follow the decision in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts</span> as the decision in <span class="font-italic">Infin</span><span class="font-italic">iteland</span> turned on the specific facts and wording of the extent of the ambit of the clauses and disclosure letters there. I should add that in that case, the accountant who conducted the due diligence exercise was fully aware of the incorrect treatment in the accounts of the sum of £1,081,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 For the purposes of this case, the salient facts in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts </span>are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant to purchase all the issued share capital in P Ltd which held 50.05% of the entire issued share capital of HM Ltd.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under the agreement, the defendant gave certain warranties including a warranty that the last audited accounts of the group of which HM Ltd was the parent (“the group”) showed a true and fair view of the group’s assets and liabilities.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 7.7 of the agreement stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is hereby agreed and acknowledged by the parties that the Warranties … are given by the [defendant] subject to matters fairly disclosed (with sufficient details to identify the nature and scope of the matter disclosed) in the Disclosure Letter in respect of which matters the [defendant] shall have no liability to the [plaintiff].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At completion of the sale, the defendant delivered a disclosure letter which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All matters disclosed, noted or referred to or for which provision is expressly made in the Management Accounts … are hereby disclosed. This letter shall be deemed to disclose and there is hereby incorporated by reference into this letter the following matters: (2) All matters and information set out or referred to in the last accounts … (3) All matters and information set out or referred to Management accounts … and all matters which are disclosed by an inspection of the Last Accounts are hereby disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for breach of warranty, on the basis that the group’s principal asset, a football stadium, was materially overvalued in the group’s audited accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 In ruling in favour of the plaintiff, Lord Penrose held that the warranties were subject to matters disclosed only where the disclosure was fair; the deemed disclosure of all matters referred to in the group’s accounts was insufficient to satisfy this criterion. His Lordship then added in <span class="font-italic">New Hearts </span>at 259 (which passage was quoted by Park J in <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([219] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mere reference to a source of information, which is in itself a complex document, within which the diligent enquirer might find relevant information will not satisfy the requirements of a clause providing for fair disclosure with sufficient details to identity the nature and scope of the matter disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 At the risk of repetition, the evidence presented by the Plaintiff clearly showed that the Defendant and WLK suppressed information on the subdivision exercise of the Subject Land as well as the existence of S&amp;P. As WLK herself testified, she never “volunteered” information to Madeline and not once did she inform Madeline (and the Plaintiff for that matter) that one of the reasons for the subdivision of the Sembulan Land was to carve out the Subject Land, not to transfer to SESB but to PHSB.  Even if <span class="font-italic">Infiniteland</span> applies, the point to note is the Disclosure Letter (see [16] above) would not benefit the Defendant when there was no disclosure in the first place but instead suppression of the relevant information. The general disclosure clauses in the Disclosure Letter certainly did not cover the subdivision, S&amp;P and the Transaction. The documents pertaining to these issues were never disclosed (see [192] above). The Defendant, therefore, could not rely on disclosure to avoid breaches of the warranties or to avoid liability under the limitation of liability clause. It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other authorities cited by the parties as those cases add nothing to those already referred to earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 Therefore, the Defendant could not rely on the limitation of liability clause in cl 8A.1(c)(i) of the SA (see [44] above). To take advantage of that clause, the Defendant must have given full disclosure to the Plaintiff of any potential liability or loss to any of the Sutera Target Group companies, which the Defendant failed to do. He was responsible for divesting the Subject Land from SHGCC’s ownership as well as for foisting onto SHGCC the encumbrances and/or liabilities referred earlier at [144]–[146] and [150]–[151].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relief</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 The Plaintiff sought an injunction against the Defendant to restrain OBSB from completing the Transaction and/or from enforcing the S&amp;P, as well as a mandatory injunction that the Defendant procure OBSB to discharge/terminate the S&amp;P.  As the former was in effect a prohibitory injunction against the Defendant in order to give effect to the warranties under the SA, the court sees no objection to granting the injunction to restrain the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Turning to the question of the mandatory injunction, the court is satisfied that such an injunction would lead to a “fair result”, considering the benefit to the Plaintiff and cost to the Defendant: <span class="font-italic">Tay Tuan Kiat and another v Pritnam Singh Brar</span> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 763 at [9]–[10]. First, as the Plaintiff argued, the Subject Land, being a part of the Sembulan Land, had a unique value to the Plaintiff. Second, the Transaction was significantly at undervalue and, given that it has not been completed, would not cost the Defendant anything to undo in any case. As the Subject Land was properly a part of the acquisition under the SA, the Defendant would not be prejudiced under the mandatory injunction. He has already been adequately compensated under the SA for the acquisition of the Sutera Target Companies, including SHGCC which owned the Subject Land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 In addition, the Plaintiff is entitled to damages for the breaches of warranty and/or indemnity against its losses due to those breaches under cl 8 of the SA. As the quantum of damages was not a matter to be determined at this trial, the court will direct the assessment of damages to be determined by the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 Consequently, the court awards judgment to the Plaintiff on its claim (see [46] above) by granting:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an injunction to restrain the Defendant from completing the Transaction and/or from enforcing the S&amp;P</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a mandatory injunction that the Defendant procure OBSB to discharge/terminate the S&amp;P forthwith;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an award of damages, with an order that an inquiry be held before the Registrar to assess the damages due to the Plaintiff for the losses that it suffered as a result of the Defendant’s breaches of the warranties; and</div><div
