However, I allowed the 10th Defendant in Counterclaim’s application in part. The particulars that I ordered to be provided were, in my view, necessary for the 10th Defendant in Counterclaim to understand the basic case that it had to meet in relation to one of the counterclaims.

That said, the standard of necessity appears elsewhere in O 18 r 12 of the ROC 2014. Order 18 r 12(1) of the ROC 2014 states that a pleading “must contain the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">necessary </span>particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded”. In this connection, it is relevant to note that the authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court: A Practice Guide</span> (Chua Lee Ming J editor-in-chief) (Academy Publishing, 2023) (the “Practice Guide”) imply at para 09.039 that the ROC 2014 and the ROC 2021 are identical and that the addition of the criterion of necessity was clarificatory: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rule 13 is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">identical</span> to Order 18 rule 12(3) of the 2014 Rules and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">clarifies</span> that the criterion for the court to order particulars is that such particulars are necessary on the facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18  In my view, the case law on further and better particulars under the ROC 2014 should broadly continue to be relevant in respect of O 9 r 13 of the ROC 2021. The following points should however be borne in mind when considering the case law under the ROC 2014:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The ROC 2021 expressly sets the standard for ordering particulars at whether the particulars sought are “necessary on the facts of the case”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The power to order particulars should be exercised having regard to the ideals set out in O 3 r 1(2) of the ROC 2021 (the “Ideals”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 With these qualifications in mind, the relevant general principles for the ordering of particulars, as laid out in the case law under the ROC 2014, may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Particulars are designed to inform the opposing party of the nature of the case that is to be met at trial so that the opposing party is not taken by surprise at the trial: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span><span class="font-italic"> AB (SE) v Sanofi-Aventis Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGHCR 7 at [12] and the Practice Guide at para 09.038. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Pleadings are to only state the material facts, and not evidence.

The lack of necessity was apparent from a close reading of the relevant paragraph of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As mentioned, the request concerned para 11.1(b) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim where there was a reference to the Claimants having made “repeated demands” for payment to the Defendant (see [20] above). According to the Defendant, particulars of these demands were necessary for the Defendant to understand the Claimants’ case on repudiatory breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, para 11.1(b) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim did not contain a pleading that the Defendant was in repudiatory breach of the MOAs. There was no such allegation made in that paragraph at all. Instead, the pleading that there were unmet demands for payment was made in support of a <span class="font-italic">different</span> point, namely, the Collateral Purposes Allegation that I have described above (see [10(a)] above). As explained, one of the Claimants’ defences to the counterclaim was that the counterclaim was being made in bad faith and/or for collateral purposes (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Collateral Purposes Allegation). One of the particulars pleaded in support of that allegation was the pleading at para 11.1(b) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, namely, that the Claimants had made repeated demands to the Defendant for payment of the Tax Invoices to no avail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The allegation that the Defendant was in repudiatory breach of the MOAs was made in a <span class="font-italic">different pleading</span>, namely, the Statement of Claim. The Statement of Claim pleads at para 9 that “demands” for payment of the sums in the Tax Invoices were made by or on behalf of the Claimants and those demands were unmet. The Statement of Claim then goes on to plead at para 11 that the Defendant is in repudiatory breach of the MOAs. The relevant paragraphs of the Statement of Claim are reproduced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Notwithstanding several demands made by and on behalf of the Claimants</span>, the Defendant has repeatedly failed, neglected and/or refused to make payment of the sums due and owing to the Claimants, as reflected in the Tax Invoices. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.  To-date, the total sum of $456,182.04 remains due and payable to the Claimants, in respect of Tax Invoices issued for the period from July 2018 to October 2018 inclusive. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">By reason of the aforesaid, the Defendant is in repudiatory breach of the MOAs</span>.

Instead, the Defendant applied for particulars of the “demands” as described at para 11.1(b) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. Even if those requested particulars were provided, they would not have provided the Defendant with the desired clarity that it sought, which was apparently to understand the case it needed to meet on <span class="font-underline">repudiatory breach</span>. The Claimants’ provision of particulars on the “demands” in a <span class="font-italic">different</span> pleading in connection with a <span class="font-italic">different</span> argument (ie, the Collateral Purposes Allegation) would not assist the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Accordingly, the requested particulars were not necessary on the facts of the case. The particulars, even if ordered and answered, would not serve the purpose for which the particulars were requested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In any case, the Defendant had some clarity on how the demands for payment of the Tax Invoices were made. As Ms Costan pointed out, Dr Lim had already identified a letter from the Claimants’ former solicitors and an email as the relevant documents containing the demands for payment. That said, the more fundamental issue with the request was that allowing it would not serve the purpose that the Defendant intended.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defendant’s application for further and better particulars of Dr Lim’s Defence to Counterclaim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I then dealt with the Defendant’s application for further and better particulars of Dr Lim’s Defence to Counterclaim as contained in Annex B to SUM 2617 (see [12(b)(ii)] above). There were two related categories of requests: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first category related to Dr Lim’s pleading at para 10(c) of his Defence to Counterclaim that he was one of the persons who submitted claims to the Defendant through the MHC System “based on information and/or documents prepared and/or supplied by the Claimants’ employees, including other doctors, nurses and/or administrative employees who Dr Lim believed to be reliable and competent in relation to the healthcare service that the Claimants provide” (the “Information and Document Providers”). The Defendant sought full particulars of the Information and Document Providers. The particulars sought included: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the full names and designations of the Information and Document Providers, as well as their Singapore Medical Council Registration numbers (where applicable); </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) which of the nine Claimants’ clinics each Information and Document Provider allegedly worked at and/or provided healthcare services to patients at; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the period(s) during which each Information and Document Provider allegedly worked at and/or provided healthcare services to patients at, the Claimants’ clinics. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second category related to Dr Lim’s pleading at para 10(d) of his Defence to Counterclaim that “other doctors, nurses, administrative employees and/or independent contractors” (the “Other Staff”) also “submitted claims through [the MHC System] on behalf of the respective Claimants”. The Defendant sought full particulars of these Other Staff. The specific particulars sought in this regard were identical to the specific particulars sought of the Information and Document Providers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Defendant submitted that it required the particulars of the Information and Document Providers and the Other Staff to understand Dr Lim’s defence to the counterclaim, know how to prepare for trial and to avoid surprise at trial.

</div> In response to a question I raised during oral submissions on what the Defendant will be doing with the particulars of the Information and Document Providers and the Other Staff, the Defendant’s counsel submitted that the particulars would assist the potential experts in family medicine and forensic accounting in understanding which of the Claimants’ claims (as submitted through the MHC System) were suspicious and unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Dr Lim opposed the request on the basis that the Defendant already knew the case it had to meet at trial. Dr Lim submitted that his pleaded position was clear. Dr Lim’s case is that he was one of 160 doctors who provided Healthcare Services and also one of the staff who submitted claims through the MHC System, relying on information and documents provided by others. Dr Lim also submitted that substantial costs will be incurred if he were made to provide the particulars requested. Dr Lim explained that he would have to trace information dating back to more than nine years ago.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In reply to the Defendant’s counsel’s oral submission that the particulars would assist the experts in family medicine and forensic accounting, Dr Lim’s counsel submitted that there was no evidence from the potential experts that the particulars sought would assist them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I decided that the requested particulars were unnecessary, and I therefore decided to disallow both requests. The requests were unnecessary for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 First, paras 10(c) and 10(d) of Dr Lim’s Defence to Counterclaim adequately set out the basic case that the Defendant had to meet at trial. The relevant paragraphs of Dr Lim’s Defence to Counterclaim stated that Dr Lim’s position was that he relied on information from the Information and Document Providers when Dr Lim submitted claims on the MHC System. Further, the Other Staff also submitted claims on the MHC System. This basic case was clearly set out and there was no ambiguity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Secondly, the requests impermissibly sought evidence. The Defendant would reasonably expect to obtain the identities of the Information and Document Providers at later stages of the proceedings when the parties prepared their evidence for the trial. Dr Lim would have to adduce evidence from the Information and Document Providers and the Other Staff to make good his pleaded position that he had relied on others when submitting claims and also that the Other Staff also submitted claims themselves. To the extent that Dr Lim is unable to adduce evidence from these persons, Dr Lim’s pleaded position would simply not be made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Thirdly, it would not be consistent with the Ideals for the particulars sought to be ordered. It would not be cost-effective in the circumstances of this case to require Dr Lim to provide particulars of the Information and Document Providers and the Other Staff. As Dr Lim submitted, to answer the requests, a review of materials dating back to nine years would be required. This would not be a cost-effective exercise. Requiring Dr Lim to undertake the exercise of obtaining the information to answer the requests would also be contrary to the Ideal that proceedings are to be conducted expeditiously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Fourthly, as regards the oral submission that the particulars would be useful for the experts in family medicine and forensic accounting, there was no evidence before me from those experts that the particulars would be helpful to them. In any case, the Defendant had yet to obtain permission to use expert evidence in this matter (see [12(b)(v)] above). It was therefore premature for the Defendant to request for particulars on the basis that the potential experts would find the particulars helpful. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dr Lim’s application for further and better particulars of the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Turning next to Dr Lim’s application (see [12(c)(i)] above), he had four categories of requests (which I refer to respectively as “Request 1”, “Request 2”, “Request 3” and “Request 4”). Request 1 and Request 2 were related and they were analysed together. I refer to them collectively in these grounds as the “Group 1 Requests”. Request 3 and Request 4 were also related. They will be referred to collectively in these grounds as the “Group 2 Requests”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Group 1 Requests</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Group 1 Requests related to the Defendant’s counterclaim that if the Inappropriate Claims contained inaccurate and/or false statements, then the Claimants and Dr Lim would have made them fraudulently and/or deceitfully (see [7]–[8] above). In its particulars in support of this counterclaim in fraud and deceit, the Defendant pleaded, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following at paras 21(a) and 21(c) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Claimants and Dr Lim “made statements” that Healthcare Services were rendered to patients as stated in each of the Inappropriate Claims, when they had not. Request 1 sought particulars of the “statements” that were allegedly made by the Claimants and Dr Lim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Claimants and Dr Lim “either knew that the Inappropriate Claims were false and untrue, or recklessly did not care whether they were true or false”. Request 2 sought particulars of the facts, documents and/or overt acts that the Defendant relied on in support of its allegation that the Claimants and Dr Lim knew that the particulars sought were false and untrue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Dr Lim submitted that the particulars he sought were necessary to understand the case he needed to meet. Dr Lim did not know the “statements” made which form the basis for the counterclaim that the Defendant was induced to make payment on the Inappropriate Claims.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I decided to allow the Group 1 Requests. My view was that the particulars requested were necessary for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 First, both requests sought particulars of the <span class="font-italic">basic</span> components of the Defendant’s counterclaim in fraud and deceit. Request 1 sought particulars of the very statements that formed the basis of the counterclaim. Request 2 sought particulars of the allegation that the Claimants and Dr Lim had knowledge of the falsity of the statements. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (at [14]), the essential elements of the tort of deceit include: (i) the making of a representation of fact by words or conduct; and (ii) the making of that representation with knowledge of its falsity. The particulars sought by Dr Lim, which relate to the basic components of the Defendant’s cause of action in the counterclaim, are necessary for Dr Lim to know the basic case that he had to meet in relation to the counterclaim in fraud and deceit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, my view was that it was consistent with the Ideals to order the particulars sought. The particulars of the “statements” made could be provided in a cost-effective manner. All that the Defendant had to do was to state, as it had in its Skeletal Submissions, that the statements were made each time the Inappropriate Claims were submitted through the MHC System. The Defendant could also easily refer to the extensive particulars of the Inappropriate Claims that have already been provided at Annexes A and B to the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As for the particulars of the alleged knowledge of the falsity of the statements, the Defendant must have had reasonable basis to allege that the Claimants and Dr Lim had such knowledge. All that the Defendant had to do is to state, to the best of its ability, its basis for believing that the Claimants and Dr Lim had such knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Group 2 Requests</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Group 2 Requests related broadly to the reliefs that the Defendant has claimed: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Request 3 concerned the Defendant’s claim that it had suffered loss and damage (see para 23 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1)).

As mentioned, the Defendant explained in the Defence and Counterclaim that the loss and damage that the Defendant had suffered fell into two specific categories (see [50] above). Thus, the basic case that Dr Lim needed to meet was clear from the existing pleadings. What Dr Lim was seeking by the Group 2 Requests was a precise quantification. That crossed into matters of evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Thirdly, the Defendant had taken the position that expert evidence would be required to assist with the exercise of determining which claims were Inappropriate Claims and the quantum of loss that had been suffered because of the submission of the Inappropriate Claims. While the Defendant had not yet obtained permission to use expert evidence, if expert evidence were eventually allowed to be used, Dr Lim would find out in due course, through the opinions of the experts, the quantum of the Defendant’s alleged loss and the basis for the calculations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Fourthly, I did not think it was consistent with the Ideals to allow the Group 2 Requests. It was not cost-effective in the present circumstances to expect the Defendant to state, in its pleadings, the loss and the amount of monies received from the Defendant as a result of the Inappropriate Claims. The extent of the loss and the monies received were matters that are best clarified through evidence, whether from experts or from factual witnesses. It was not cost-effective to expect the Defendant to undertake the work of quantifying the precise amounts that it was claiming at this juncture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In summary, my decision was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the Defendant’s SAPT (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SUM 2617), I dismissed the prayers concerning the application for further and better particulars (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, prayers 1 to 4).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to Dr Lim’s SAPT (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SUM 2618), I only allowed paras 1 and 2 of Annex A to SUM 2618 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Group 1 Requests). Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Annex A to SUM 2618 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Group 2 Requests) were disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 After hearing the parties, I made the following orders on costs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Defendant’s SAPT</span>: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) I ordered that the Defendant was to pay the Claimants costs fixed at $2,500, all in. The Defendant only pursued one category against the Claimants (see [20] above). The arguments on that single category did not take significant time. Thus, I thought this was a case where costs should be awarded at the lower end of the range in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“Appendix G”) for applications for further and better particulars (the reference range is $2,000 to $9,000, excluding disbursements).</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) I also ordered that the Defendant was to pay Dr Lim costs fixed at $3,500, all in. The Defendant pursued two categories of requests against Dr Lim (see [30] above). However, the arguments for both categories overlapped. More time was spent addressing these categories as compared to the application against the Claimants. Thus, bearing in mind the range in Appendix G and the amount of disbursements that were claimed to have been incurred, my view was that a quantum of $3,500, all in, was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Dr Lim’s SAPT</span>: Both Dr Lim and the Defendant submitted that the appropriate order was no order as to costs. I agreed with the parties that this was the appropriate order in the circumstances. I allowed two requests and disallowed two requests (see [54(b)] above). The time spent and the complexity of the arguments for the allowed requests were broadly similar to the time spent and the complexity of the arguments for the disallowed requests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I record my appreciation to all counsel for their helpful submissions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vikram Rajaram<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Josephine Costan (David Nayar and Associates) for the claimants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Colin Wu and Tammie Khor (Braddell Brothers LLP) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ning Jie, Cedric Sun and Preshin Manmindar (Damodara Ong LLC) for the 10th defendant by counterclaim. </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
