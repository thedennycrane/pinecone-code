<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 10 February 2010, Steven Chong JC
                    (as he then was) dismissed the claim made by David Lam Chi Kin (“the
                    appellant”) against Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft’s (“the
                    bank”) in Suit No. 834 of 2008 and granted judgment for some
                    US$1.135 million (“the High Court judgment”) in respect of
                    the bank’s counterclaim against the appellant. The appellant has appealed
                    to the Court of Appeal against the High Court judgment (in Civil Appeal
                    no. 41 of 2010). The appeal is scheduled to be heard in the week commencing
                    16 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In execution of the High Court judgment, the
                    bank commenced these bankruptcy proceedings against the appellant on
                    29 March 2010 for his failure to comply with the bank’s statutory
                    demand for payment of the judgment debt. On 17 April 2010, the appellant
                    applied before an AR for the bankruptcy application to be set aside or for an
                    unconditional stay of the bankruptcy proceedings pending his appeal against the
                    High Court judgment. On 14 May 2010, the AR granted the appellant a stay on
                    condition that he provide security for $500,000 either by payment into court or
                    by any other agreed means by 4 June 2010. The appellant appealed against
                    the AR’s decision on the ground that he did not have the financial means
                    to provide the security ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal against the AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant stated that the parties have filed
                    their respective Cases already and the appeal before the Court of Appeal was
                    less than two months away. Although the bank argued before the AR that a
                    conditional stay of the bankruptcy proceedings was appropriate because there was
                    a risk that the appellant was dissipating his assets by selling his apartment in
                    Singapore, the appellant pointed out that his previous two affidavits had
                    disclosed that he needed to liquidate his assets in order to pay for the legal
                    fees for the action and he argued that the sale of his apartment was towards
                    this end. For instance, in his affidavit of 5 November 2009 (filed for
                    another hearing), the appellant said (at [4] to [6] thereof) that he did not
                    have sufficient funds at that point in time to appoint new lawyers to represent
                    him in this action due to some liquidity issues and that he decided to liquidate
                    some of his assets and, if the need arose, would approach his relatives for
                    financial assistance. The AR was of the view that the said affidavits were not
                    clear enough to address the concern of dissipation of assets and therefore
                    ordered a conditional stay of the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In his notice of appeal, the appellant sought to
                    admit further evidence before me by way of his affidavit affirmed in Hong Kong
                    SAR and filed on 31 May 2010 (“the new affidavit”), which is
                    after the hearing before the AR. He also asked that the bankruptcy proceedings
                    be set aside or, alternatively, that they be stayed unconditionally pending the
                    appeal against the High Court judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The new affidavit dealt with two main matters.
                    The first was that the sale of his apartment in Singapore was not for the
                    purpose of dissipating his assets here. The second matter concerned his
                    inability to put up the security of $500,000 ordered as well as to pay the
                    judgment debt. The appellant submitted that his property at 180A Bencoolen
                    Street #12-07 Singapore 189647 (“the Bencoolen property”) was sold
                    to finance the legal costs of the action and that there was no intention to
                    dissipate assets. He thought this was clear enough from [6] of the affidavit of
                    5 November 2009 (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). He
                    granted an option to purchase on 26 November 2009 and therefore did not
                    file an affidavit on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the new affidavit, the appellant confirmed
                    that the Bencoolen property was sold to finance the fees payable to his previous
                    lawyers, M/s Lee &amp; Lee, the fees payable to M/s M Pillay for the
                    trial and the appeal therefrom and the security for costs of the appeal. Besides
                    these, he also had to sell the Bencoolen property as he could no longer afford
                    to pay the monthly mortgage payments of about $13,000 to the United Overseas
                    Bank. The net sale proceeds, after repaying the mortgage, amounted to about
                    $400,000, most of which were used to provide for the said legal fees and
                    security for costs of the appeal. In respect of security for costs of the
                    appeal, he provided the prescribed amount of $20,000 and when further security
                    was requested by the bank, he provided another $10,000 in security to obviate
                    further legal costs in unnecessary interlocutory applications and
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The appellant’s agreement with the
                    purchasers of the Bencoolen property was for him to rent it for three months
                    from the date of completion of the sale and purchase (in February 2010) at a
                    monthly rent of $4,150. Unfortunately, he could not afford to continue renting
                    it after about one month and had to surrender the tenancy prematurely on
                    14 March 2010. He could no longer afford to live in Singapore and therefore
                    left for Hong Kong that day to try to seek assistance from relatives and
                    friends. He came here from Hong Kong in 1996. He separated from his wife in
                    April 2003 and was ordered to pay $4,000 a month as maintenance for her and
                    their daughter. He could not afford to make this monthly payment any
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Save for the Bencoolen property, almost all of
                    the appellant’s assets were in foreign currency deposits with financial
                    institutions such as the bank. As a result of the financial turmoil in September
                    and October 2008, most of these deposits were wiped out. He lost all his foreign
                    currency deposits of NZD30 m with the bank alone. All he has now is an amount of
                    about $9,000 which he needs for living and medical expenses (for his diabetes
                    and hypertension).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The appellant also has an outstanding judgment
                    for JPY 29,062,179.35 (or about USD323,000) entered against him by BNP Paribas
                    Wealth Management (“BNP”) in Suit No. 375 of 2008. He paid
                    BNP $30,000 upfront and agreed to pay $5,000 monthly (up to July 2010) and
                    thereafter $10,000 monthly. He paid up to April 2010 but could not make the
                    instalment payments after that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The appellant affirmed that he does not have
                    the means to provide the $500,000 security ordered by the AR or to pay the
                    judgment sum owing to the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before the AR and before me, the appellant
                    relied on section 65(4)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20). Section 65(4) is
                    in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a bankruptcy application has been made against a debtor
                        on the ground that the debtor –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    has failed to pay a judgment debt, and there
                                is pending an appeal from or an application to set aside, the
                                judgment or order by virtue of which the judgment debt is payable;
                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    has failed to comply with a statutory demand,
                                and there is pending an application to set aside the statutory
                                demand,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the court may, if it thinks fit, stay or dismiss the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The appellant submitted that the legislative
                    intent of section 65(4)(b) is clear. It is to prevent a party from suffering the
                    prejudice associated with bankruptcy before his appeal against a judgment debt
                    (which forms the basis of the bankruptcy application) is heard. This rationale,
                    it was argued, applies fully to the facts here especially since the appellant
                    has affirmed on affidavit that he is unable to pay the judgment debt and the
                    security ordered and that all he has is about $9,000 for his living and medical
                    expenses. As the Court of Appeal will be hearing the appeal against the High
                    Court judgment in less than two months and the respective Cases have already
                    been filed, the bank would suffer no prejudice from an unconditional stay of the
                    bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The bank’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The bank objected to the admission of the new
                    affidavit as it was made after the hearing before the AR. Even if the new
                    affidavit was admitted by the court, the bank argued that it would not provide a
                    basis for the court to reverse the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the hearing before the AR, the bank relied
                    on section 64(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may at any time, for sufficient reason, make an order staying
                        the proceedings on a bankruptcy application, either altogether or for a
                        limited time, on such terms and conditions as the court may think
                        just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The bank relied on <em>Lee Kiang Leng Stanley v Lee Han
                        Chew (trading as Joe Li Electrical Supplies)</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 151 for the proposition that section 64(1) allows the
                    court to order security for the full amount or part of the judgment debt as a
                    condition for staying bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It was just for the AR to order the appellant
                    to furnish security for part of the judgment debt as there was solid evidence of
                    a real risk of dissipation of assets by the appellant. The appellant sold the
                    Bencoolen property on 9 December 2009 for $1.05 million. This took
                    place during the course of the trial. The trial was heard on 30 November,
                    1, 2 and 23 December 2009. The appellant claimed that he sold the Bencoolen
                    property to help pay his legal fees. In support of this, he relied solely on a
                    single sentence at [6] of his affidavit of 5 November 2009 which was filed
                    for his application to vacate the trial dates. That sentence was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I came out from this PTC even more convinced that I will require
                        representation by a lawyer, and I decided that I would liquidate some of my
                        assets and if the need arose, approach my relatives for financial
                        assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The AR felt that the above statement did not
                    refer to the sale of the Bencoolen property and was therefore insufficient to
                    address the concern of dissipation of assets. He was satisfied that the pending
                    appeal before the Court of Appeal was a <em>bona fide</em>
                    one but did not see any grounds to set aside the bankruptcy
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The appellant, it was submitted, was hoping to
                    repair his position at the eleventh hour by seeking the court’s leave to
                    adduce the new affidavit. The appellant had enough time, between 21 April
                    2010 when the bank filed its affidavit to 14 May 2010 when the AR heard the
                    application for a stay, to file an affidavit which would fully explain his
                    decision to sell the Bencoolen property during the trial. However, the appellant
                    chose not to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Even if the new affidavit was admitted on
                    appeal and accepted at face value, it would not provide any basis to reverse the
                    AR’s decision. Firstly, impecuniosity would not operate as a bar to an
                    order for security. Rather, it is a factor which the court may take into account
                    in deciding whether it is just to order the provision of security. Secondly, it
                    is not sufficient to complain that the security order is difficult to meet. The
                    court has to be satisfied that it would be impossible to comply with the
                    security order. The fact that a man has no capital of his own does not mean that
                    he cannot raise any capital from friends, business associates and relatives
                        (<em>M V Yorke Motors (A firm) v Edwards</em> [1982]
                    1 WLR 444). Although these observations were made in the context of an
                    application for summary judgment, the bank argued that they were equally
                    applicable to any situation where the court has discretionary power whether to
                    impose a financial condition on a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The bank pointed out that in the new
                    affidavit, the appellant said “most” of the net sale proceeds of
                    $400,000 were used to pay legal fees and to provide security for costs of the
                    appeal before the Court of Appeal and not that “all” were used for
                    those purposes. This was on the assumption that he received no more than
                    $400,000 out of the sale price of $1.05 million. He also claimed that he left
                    for Hong Kong to try to seek assistance from relatives and friends. It was
                    therefore within his means to raise capital. He was silent on whether he was
                    successful in that objective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It seems to me that the more appropriate
                    provision for the appellant to rely on in section 65(4)(a) rather than section
                    65(4)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I decided to admit the new affidavit as it
                    merely elaborates on the appellant’s alleged financial woes, something
                    that was already in contention. What I found sorely lacking in the new affidavit
                    was documentary proof of how the sale proceeds from the Bencoolen property were
                    utilized for each stated purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The sale was completed only in February this
                    year and the appellant would surely still have the completion account from his
                    conveyancing lawyer. This would have shown the amount actually paid to the
                    mortgagee bank and whether he truly received only “about
                    $400,000”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was easily within the appellant’s
                    ability to produce receipts from his former and his present solicitors on the
                    amount of legal fees paid by him thus far but the appellant appears to expect
                    everyone to simply accept what he has stated in his new affidavit. He did not
                    even mention how much he paid his solicitors except that the amount of legal
                    fees and security for costs took up “most” of the $400,000. The
                    trial was not a long one in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There is also no document to back up his
                    statements about the rental agreement with the purchasers of the Bencoolen
                    property. He left Hong Kong for Singapore 14 years ago and has now returned to
                    Hong Kong. The new affidavit states a “care of” residential
                    address in Hong Kong with no explanation as to whose flat he is presently
                    staying in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The appellant was also completely silent on
                    his efforts to seek financial assistance from his relatives and friends in Hong
                    Kong since his departure from Singapore on 14 March 2010 although that was
                    one of his professed objectives in leaving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The appellant’s unsatisfactory account
                    of how the sale proceeds of the Bencoolen property were utilized coupled with
                    the lack of documentary proof leaves one with serious doubts about the truth of
                    his assertions of impecuniosity. An applicant against whom judgment has been
                    entered after a trial and who is seeking the court’s protection from
                    bankruptcy proceedings should be candid and forthcoming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Even if we assume that he received only
                    $400,000 out of the sale proceeds of the Bencoolen property, he has not properly
                    accounted for this amount. I decided to proceed on this assumption and made a
                    generous allowance of three-quarters of that amount for his alleged payments.
                    After deducting $30,000 for the security for costs of the appeal against the
                    High Court judgment, he would have $270,000 to pay his former and his current
                    solicitors. That leaves the appellant with at least $100,000 and it is this
                    amount that I ordered him to provide security for by 1 July 2010. The
                    amount in the AR’s order on security is therefore varied from $500,000 to
                    $100,000. The costs of this Registrar’s Appeal are to abide by the costs
                    of the appeal before the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The appellant has appealed against the order
                    for security in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above (in Civil Appeal
                    No. 115 of 2010) and has applied for the appeal to be heard on an expedited
                    basis. A Judge has dispensed with the filing of the Record of Appeal and the
                    Appellant’s Case. The Court of Appeal will hear the appeal on Friday,
                    6 August 2010.</p>
