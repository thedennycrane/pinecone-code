The issue in contention was whether Kaefer Singapore owed the Company S$1,544,142.47. Majority and minority shareholders held opposing views and Mr Chng therefore applied for leave to commence a suit on behalf of the Company under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The parties joined issue on whether an additional S$1,544,142.47 (“the Sum”) was rightfully due to the Company. Mr Chng’s evidence was that the Sum was retained by Kaefer Singapore on the condition that Kaefer Singapore and Kaefer Germany recognise that the Company was entitled to the Sum. This was the Sum Mr Chng sought to pursue by way of derivative action against Kaefer Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The respondents disagreed with Mr Chng’s version of events, and contended the application was made for collateral purposes: namely, for Mr Chng to inflate the value of his shares in anticipation of a share buyout. In or around September 2019, Mr Chng sought for Kaefer Germany to purchase his 20% shareholding. This was governed by a Shareholders Agreement of 20 July 2016 and an Addendum of 1 September 2016 between Mr Chng, the Company and Kaefer Germany (collectively, “the SHA”). The SHA gave Kaefer Germany the exclusive option to require Mr Chng to sell his shares. A formula was set out in the SHA to calculate the value of Mr Chng’s shares. This formula was premised on the Company’s average annual audited earnings before tax for the financial period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, with a proviso for a minimum base price of S$3m if exercised by Kaefer Germany. Kaefer Germany declined to exercise the option. When Mr Chng sought to sell his shares, he valued his shares at S$3m. Kaefer Germany’s price, calculated using the formula prescribed by the SHA but without the price floor of S$3m, was about S$792,000. The share buyout fell through but formed the context for this dispute. Mr Chng first raised the issue of the Sum in that negotiation, and the respondents contended that Mr Chng’s motive for taking out a derivative action arose out of this failed negotiation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of issues and decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Under s 216A(3) of the Companies Act, three requirements must be met in order for leave to be granted for a derivative action to commence.

These documents collectively reflected an obligation on the part of Kaefer Singapore to pay the Company a total of S$1,931,291.95 for the scope of work envisaged. None of the documents bore out Mr Chng’s assertion that the remaining S$1,544,142.47 of the profits from the Yamal Project were rightfully the Company’s. Mr Chng was the Managing Director of the Company at the time, but alleged that he had “never seen” the Management Agreements. Despite not having dealt with them, he was sure that they had been prepared for “accounting purposes to account for the $1,931,291.95 that has been paid to the Company”.

This, he said, was captured in an oral agreement reflecting a sum additional to the S$1,931,291.95 paid.

</div> But this Project Account did not assist his case at all. All the Project Account showed was that there was a total profit of S$3,475,434.42 from the Yamal Project, of which S$1,931,291.95 was paid to the Company (see above at [2]) while the remaining S$1,544,142.47 was retained by Kaefer Singapore. This merely suggested (without necessarily proving) that the Company had been contracted to complete the same work at a different fee from that which Kaefer Singapore was paid for the Yamal Project. Kaefer Singapore was perfectly entitled to do this. This was a matter of contract between the parties, and in this case, the two companies were related companies.

In his words, they “only [go] to show that S$1,931,291.95 was paid by Kaefer Singapore to the Company”.

</div> But the difference between the evidence adduced by both sides was crucial. Kaefer Singapore and Kaefer Germany, on the one hand, reflected a credible, consistent and documented position. Mr Chng, on the other hand, stood on his bare allegation even though at the material time, as Managing Director, he could well have documented any arrangement if one existed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I concluded that there was no evidence to support his claim and that accordingly, there was no legitimate and arguable case on which to maintain a derivative action on behalf of the Company against Kaefer Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Leave to file further reply affidavit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In this context, I declined to grant leave for Mr Chng to file a further affidavit (“the SUM 2145 Affidavit”). Prior to the summons, Mr Chng had filed two affidavits, and the assistant registrar had disallowed any further replies. Notwithstanding, Mr Chng filed an application for a further reply, which was fixed for hearing at the same time as the application for leave to commence the derivative action. The proposed affidavit, nonetheless, did not contain any documentary evidence to support Mr Chng’s contentions, but merely further bare assertions. A statutory declaration from one Mr Kevin Tan (“Mr Tan”) was its main feature.

</div> Mr Tan was the Regional Financial Controller at Kaefer Singapore who resigned on 13 March 2017. This was the man to whom Mr Chng referred when he explained to Mr Hansen that a verbal confirmation of the agreement between the Company and Kaefer Singapore had been given: see [12] above.  His evidence was troubling for at least three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 First, Mr Tan did not file an affidavit, but his statutory declaration was exhibited in Mr Chng’s affidavit. Secondly, there was no explanation why Mr Tan’s testimony was not procured much earlier in the application. Third and most importantly, Mr Tan’s statutory declaration simply did not assist Mr Chng’s case at all. Mr Tan indicated that he was not personally privy to any agreement about entitlement to the Sum. While Mr Chng’s position all along was that Mr Tan was the one who made the promise, Mr Tan’s declaration stated that the arrangement was made between one Justin Cooper (hitherto unmentioned in Mr Chng’s affidavits and featured for the first time in Mr Tan’s statutory declaration) on behalf of Kaefer Singapore, and Mr Chng. He had merely been “informed of the agreement and therefore carried out the instructions accordingly”.

</div> Despite being the sole source of verification for Mr Chng up till that point, Mr Tan’s statutory declaration did not explain or clarify the 8 March email upon which Mr Chng’s case rested. He did not describe how the Sum was to be retained by Kaefer Singapore on a condition that it would be paid later to the Company. He simply asserted, at paragraph 4, that “the Company will be entitled to all of the profits from the Yamal Project”. At paragraph 5, he then linked this to the acquisition of Mr Chng’s shares: “[Mr Chng] was informed about the valuation of the pay-out wherein the profit from the Yamal project will be considered even though it may not be reflected in the Company’s financial performance.” His final line in paragraph 7 is wholly unexplained: “In the event [Kaefer Germany] does not wish to acquire 100% of the shares in the Company, the Yamal profit in [Kaefer] Singapore should be reflected back in the Company to ensure the correct value can be distributed to both shareholders ([Kaefer Germany] 80%, Chng Kheng Chye 20%).” Mr Tan did not substantiate any of these assertions with any documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Counsel for Mr Chng contended that the oral understanding could be established by calling at trial witnesses such as Mr Tan, Mr Chng, and Mr Cooper.

Separate, because the conceptual integrity of the good faith requirement requires an assessment of the applicant’s honest and reasonable belief; an inference of bad faith cannot be drawn from the lack of an arguable cause of action. But yet the two issues are connected, because a court “may find that the applicant lacks good faith if no reasonable person in his position could believe that a good cause of action existed”. An applicant would have difficulty proving an honest or reasonable belief in the merits of the claim if the claim is frivolous (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [55]). This was the case at hand, where Mr Chng sought to bring suit on behalf of the Company on the premise of bare allegation. No reasonable person in Mr Chng’s position could have believed that an arguable case existed. The objective weakness of his case, when considered in tandem with his self-interest (see above at [26]) and earlier correspondence (see above at [25]), informed my finding that there was no good faith in this application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I therefore dismissed both Originating Summons 227 of 2020 and SUM 2145.
