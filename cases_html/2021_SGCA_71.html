The use of Form D is statutorily mandated by s 5 of the Sale of Commercial Properties Act (Cap 281, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) read with r 7 of the Rules (collectively “the legislative scheme”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We allow the appeal in part and set out our reasons herein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 It bears noting at the outset that in their submissions before this court, the appellants have raised various arguments which in effect challenge or ignore the arbitrator’s findings of fact.

This is impermissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Singapore has adopted a dual track regime for arbitration, one track for international arbitration under the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) and another track for domestic arbitration under the AA. Some practitioners have opined that, generally speaking, there is a higher degree of court intervention in domestic arbitration as compared to international arbitration.

</div>
</div> Whilst this may be true at a general level, especially when compared to the provisions of the IAA and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”), it should not be forgotten that the court can only intervene in instances where the statutory provisions of the AA allow the court to do so. Section 47 of the AA provides that the court shall not have jurisdiction to confirm, vary, set aside or remit an award except where provided in the AA. The grounds upon which the court can set aside an award in s 48 AA are adopted from the Model Law and mirror the grounds under the New York Convention.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore vol 1(2) (LexisNexis, 2017 Reissue) para 20.128.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San </span><span class="font-italic">Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125, this Court ruled that given the clear legislative intent to align domestic arbitration laws with the Model Law, the court was entitled, indeed even required, to have regard to the scheme of the IAA or the Model Law for guidance on the interpretation of the Act, unless a clear departure was provided for in the Act (at [34]). It bears repeating that the court does not sit as an appellate court from arbitral tribunals. This is true even in the context of domestic arbitration under the AA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 One of the main areas where the court interacts with arbitration under the AA (and which is a clear difference from international arbitration under the IAA) is where parties raise questions of law. This can occur at two stages. The first arises during the course of arbitral proceedings under s 45(1) of the AA. This is not engaged in the present appeal. The present appeal involves questions of law at the second stage, after an award is made. Under s 49(1) of the AA, a party may appeal to the court on a question of law rising out of an award with the agreement of all the other parties to the proceedings or with leave of court (see s 49(3) of the AA). Nonetheless, an appeal on questions of law arising from an arbitration award pursuant to s 49 of the AA is not a backdoor appeal of the award. As this court stated in <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span>”) at [17], “it is essential to delineate between a ‘question of law’ and an ‘error of law’, for the former confers jurisdiction on a court to grant leave to appeal against an arbitration award while the latter, in itself, does not”. This distinction was also well put by G P Selvam JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Ahong Construction (S) Pte Ltd v United Boulevard Pte Ltd </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 208 at [7]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A question of law means a <span class="font-italic">point of law in controversy</span> which has to be resolved after opposing views and arguments have been considered. It is a matter of substance the determination of which will decide the rights between the parties. … If the point of law is settled and not something novel and it is contended that the arbitrator made an error in the application of the law there lies no appeal against that error for there is no question of law which calls for an opinion of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above passage was quoted with approval in <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator </span>at [18]. Hence, where an arbitrator erred in only awarding costs incurred by an amendment due to his failure to consider the element of costs thrown away, it was only an error of application of a settled principle of law and did not give rise to a right to appeal on a question of law, and the absence in the AA of a similar provision set out in s 28(1) of the previous Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the court did not have jurisdiction to set aside or remit an award on the ground of errors of fact or law on the face of the record, did not mean that the court would now allow an appeal on grounds that the arbitrator committed an error in respect of established law (see <span class="font-italic">Econ Piling Pte Ltd and another (both formerly trading as Econ-NCC Joint Venture) v Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Econ Piling</span>”) at [102] to [104]). Although the AA does provide instances where the court can exercise supervisory jurisdiction over domestic arbitral tribunals in domestic arbitrations, the judicial philosophy remains that of a “light touch”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the courts should not exercise tight supervisory power over arbitral proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 We will point out, at appropriate junctures, where the parties have lost sight of these basic important principles.

Although Form D contains statutorily prescribed terms ([22] above), they were <span class="font-italic">indirectly </span>prescribed through the medium of the contract, and Parliament had intended contractual principles to govern the parties’ relationship (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [46] to [52]). The aim of contractual interpretation is to give effect to parties’ intentions. Parties are usually presumed to intend a commercial result (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [76]). However, since the purpose of the Act is to protect purchasers against developers and to positively reallocate risk to developers (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [62] to [75]), an uncommercial interpretation of terms in Form D (in favour of the purchaser) could be possible (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [76] to [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Judge then applied contractual interpretation principles to interpret the three disputed phrases. The Judge interpreted all three disputed phrases in favour of the respondent, and also answered all five questions of law in favour of the respondent. The precise findings of the Judge and the arguments of the parties will be discussed in detail below at the relevant segments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The appellant appealed against the entirety of the Judge’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues before this Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This appeal requires the court to answer the five questions of law set out in OS 1334 ([36] above). That is the correct focus of the appeal. However, as noted above, the parties in their submissions to the court below made many arguments disputing the arbitrator’s findings of fact and the arbitrator’s application of legal principles to the facts. This caused the Judge to spend much effort in addressing these issues even though they are not part of the five questions of law that need to be decided. The parties rehash many of these arguments on appeal although a significant portion clearly fall outside the scope of this appeal, which must only concern questions of law under s 49 AA. It is not the role of the appeal court to revisit the arbitrator’s findings of fact as the arbitrator’s findings of facts are conclusive and the court has to decide any questions of law on the basis of those facts (see s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the AA as well as <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Chua Aik Kia (trading as Uni Sanitary Electrical Construction)</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 419 at [16] and [29]). We will therefore disregard these contentions and will focus on the arguments which pertain to the five questions of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The issues to be decided in order to determine the five questions of law are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the approach to interpreting statutorily mandated terms found in standard form contracts; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) to the extent necessary, the interpretation of the three disputed phrases.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The parties substantially take the same position and raise the same arguments as they have below in relation to the three disputed phrases.

The respondent filed SUM 2 to strike out all of the Appellant’s Reply, save for paragraphs 25 and 26. The respondent argues that the disputed paragraphs pertain to matters that do not fall within the scope permitted by O 57 r 9A(5A) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), and that alternatively, the filing of the disputed paragraphs is an abuse of process. The appellant disagrees with both contentions. We make no order on SUM 2 as we are inclined to consider the arguments in the Appellant’s Reply and we are of the view that they would have come up in the oral hearing in any event (see also <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter </span>[2017] 2 SLR 185 at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The framework for interpreting statutorily prescribed contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As noted above at [39], the Judge held that principles of contractual interpretation, and not statutory interpretation, should apply to interpret terms found in statutorily imposed standard form contracts.

It simply depends if these amended plans and specifications were “approved by the Purchaser at the date of this Agreement”. As we had made clear to the parties at the oral hearing, this is a simple question and does not have to be made more complicated than necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 What plans and specifications had been approved by the purchaser is a question of fact which must depend on the circumstances of each case, to be assessed based on the purchaser’s knowledge, actual or constructive, and his state of mind at the date of the agreement. The plans and specifications approved by the purchaser do not necessarily have to be consolidated in some written form, as long as there is some evidence as to what the purchaser had approved or deemed to have approved, at the relevant time. The purchaser also cannot be deemed to have approved changes that were not yet in existence at the time of the SPA. This is so even if those plans and specifications carried a notice that clearances from certain technical departments were outstanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The appellant contended during oral submissions that this approach would be too uncertain. Instead, there must be a specific set of fixed plans and specifications in order for the purchaser to be able to approve it. If the plans were subject to change, there would be no baseline and no plans and specifications approved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We reject this submission. It does not reflect reality nor the normal processes of property development and if true, will obviate any need for a provision like cl 15.4 <span class="font-weight-bold">which contemplates that the plans and specifications may change. The very purpose of cl 15.4 is to allocate the risk in the event that the plans and specifications at the date of the sale and purchase agreement and the final approved plans are different</span> (see also [76] below)<span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> Clause 15.4 provides if that they differ substantially, the purchaser is entitled to terminate the sale and purchase agreement and if not, the purchaser remains bound by the agreement. In addition, it cannot be argued that the purchaser did not approve any plans. If that were the case, there would be no contract because the purchaser had not even agreed on the subject matter of the contract. Such a contract would be void for uncertainty. As we pointed out to the appellant during its oral submissions, it cannot have his legal cake and eat it. If there is a contract with certain subject matter and certain terms, it is a necessary corollary that the developer and the purchaser must have had a set of plans and specifications which are sufficiently certain for there to be a sale and purchase of the property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Our view is supported by the general legislative purpose of the Act, and the specific legislative purpose of cl 15.4 of Form D. The Judge rightly pointed out (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [62]) that the general purpose of the legislative scheme is to protect purchasers against developers conducting sales of commercial units in an inequitable manner (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (30 March 1979) vol 39 at cols 319–320):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There have been complaints from the public about the inequitable manner in which some developers conduct the sales of their shop units …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Rules to be enacted under this Bill will require agreements for sale and option forms to contain such terms and conditions as may be prescribed.

It bears emphasis that this is a question of fact which has been decided by the arbitrator and it is not open to the parties or this court to revisit the arbitrator’s findings of fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Be that as it may, in this case, there are various uncontroversial facts which will determine what plans and specifications the respondent had approved, or, in other words, what the respondent had agreed to purchase at the time of the agreement. These facts were before the arbitrator. As referenced above, the respondent was provided with the marketing brochure and saw a 3D model of the Oxley Tower development. <span class="font-italic">Both</span> the marketing brochure and 3D model showed people mingling around the softscape areas of the roof garden and stepping on the softscape areas. Further, the marketing brochure and 3D model also showed the softscape to be level with the rest of the hardscape areas. The marketing brochure showed the position and shape of Units 1 and 2, the indoor and outdoor areas, including the private roof gardens for each unit and the swimming pool for Unit 1. In addition, the marketing brochure referred to the 2012 BCA Plan, which depicted the softscape to be flush with the hardscape ([12] above). The 2012 BCA Plan was referred to in both SPAs as well as both OTPs. Based on these pieces of information as a baseline, the respondent requested for the appellant to change the spa/gym in Unit 1 to a restaurant, and the swimming pool into a roof garden. Hence, we are in entire agreement with the arbitrator and the Judge that the plans and specifications that the respondent had approved must have been the 2012 BCA Plan (subject to the two Changes). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The appellant alternatively argues that there were no approved plans and specifications as the respondent had never seen the 2012 BCA Plans before entering into the contract.

</div>
</div> This can be seen by the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 3 of the Act prohibits the sale of any commercial property unless the plans for the construction or erection of the commercial property have been approved by the Building Authority. Section 2 of the Act defines Building Authority as having the same meaning as in the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Building Control Act”), and s 2 of the Building Control Act defines the Building and Construction Authority as the BCA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)   The standard form OTP found in Form B of the Rules requires the number of building plans approved by the Commissioner of Building Control, the identification number(s) of these building plan(s), and the date of approval of those plans to be stated therein. This is a reference to BCA approved plans because the Commissioner of Building Control is defined in s 2 of the Building Control Act to be the commissioner responsible for the Building Control Act.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The standard form SPA found in Form D of the Rules also requires the building plan number of the approved building plan to be stated therein. This is the same building plan as stated in the OTP, as the SPA is entered into in the course of exercising the OTP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It should be borne in mind that cl 15.4 does not require the purchaser to have actually examined the plans. Instead, what plans the purchaser had approved, whether with actual or constructive knowledge, is a question of fact which can be inferred based on the circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 When this is borne in mind, we are in agreement with the arbitrator’s finding that the approved plans were the 2012 BCA Plans (subject to the Changes). While the respondent had never seen the 2012 BCA Plans, these were the plans referred to in the OTPs and the SPAs, and the respondent must be taken to have given constructive approval at the time of entering the OTPs and SPAs. The purchaser will be taken to be bound by those plans because those were the plans the appellant would have been given if it had asked for them. It cannot make any difference that the BCA Notice of Approval stated that some clearances from technical departments were outstanding. If changes were subsequently made to comply with the requirements of these technical departments, they could not have been “approved” by the purchaser because they were not yet in existence at the time of the SPAs. The effect of such a caveat is simply that changes could be made to the plans and specifications as a result of complying with the technical departments and authorities’ requirements. Clause 15.4 was inserted precisely to deal with these kinds of changes (leaving aside for the moment the requested Changes by the respondent which we deal with below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The appellant also contends that even if a purchaser can be taken to have approved a plan subject to changes, the purchaser must be taken to have also approved all further changes required by the authorities. If this were not the case, there would be an improper result as a purchaser would be allowed to approve plans and specifications which have not been authorised by the authorities.

</div> The appellant also argues that its proposed interpretation is consistent with cll 10.1 and 10.3 of Form D (and, by extension, the SPAs) which provide:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.1 The Vendor must as soon as possible build the Unit, together with all common property of the Building, in a good and workmanlike manner according to the Specifications and the plans approved by the Commissioner of Building Control and other relevant authorities.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.3 The Vendor must obtain all the necessary consents and approvals of the Commissioner of Building Control and other relevant authorities for the construction of the Unit, and must comply with all the requirements of the Commissioner of Building Control and other relevant authorities for the construction of the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The appellant’s arguments in favour of consistency (as mentioned above in the preceding paragraph) is based on the notion that the purchaser cannot be allowed to insist that the vendor build the property according to the requirements of the authorities, but at the same time maintain that he has not approved those plans at the date of agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 These, and similar arguments raised by the appellant, can be disposed of briefly as they unfortunately completely ignore the facts of the case, are illogical, and are bereft of reality. As we have stated at [63] above, <span class="font-weight-bold">there is nothing wrong with a purchaser approving plans which are subject to further development and change because that is part of the development and building process</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, and cl 15.4 provides a mechanism to cater for these changes</span>. We therefore see no inconsistency between cl 15.4 and cl 10; they both work in a complementary fashion to protect the purchaser.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 We therefore agree with the arbitrator’s and Judge’s findings that the approved plans were the 2012 BCA Plans (subject to the Changes, which we shall deal with below), and that the subsequent changes made ([28] above) were not approved by the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Question 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Question 2 asks: where a purchaser of commercial property under construction requests that changes be made to the specifications of the unit, would the purchaser be entitled to rely on cl 15.4 where he has not formally approved of the plans and specifications incorporating the changes he has requested, or is he left to his remedies at common law?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Judge found that the purchaser would be allowed to rely on cl 15.4 even if he had not formally approved the plans and specifications incorporating the changes requested (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [150(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Whilst we agree in general with the Judge’s answer to this question, we would also add that this question is a red herring in a number of respects. First and foremost, the respondent’s emphasis on a <span class="font-italic">formally</span> approved a set of plans or specifications is misplaced. We have already stated at [61] above that the “approval” does not necessarily have to be consolidated in some written form, as long as there is evidence of what the purchaser had approved or deemed to have approved at the date of the SPA, which is the starting point of the enquiry. From that reference point, if substantial differences were made to or had somehow crept into the plan or specifications after the date of the SPA and these were not requested or specifically agreed to by the purchaser, it would still have had recourse to cl 15.4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Secondly, as referenced above, cl 15.4 is a provision within Form D and the parties cannot amend, delete or otherwise render cl 15.4 inoperative without the prior written approval of the Controller (see r 7(2) of the Rules). Parties are thus not able to add a requirement of “formal” approval without the approval of the Controller. There is no question of a waiver or approval of such a change having been sought or given in this case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Thirdly, on the facts of this case, the respondent could not possibly have approved or agreed to a plan and specifications which incorporated the Changes at the date of the SPAs because it would not be known what changes or differences there might be until the relevant authorities had considered the same and responded. Moreover, it is certainly not the appellant’s case, nor is there any evidence, that the respondent agreed to proceed with the purchase of the units regardless of what amendments or changes were imposed or required by the authorities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Fourthly, the Changes the respondent requested were not simple or stand-alone changes, like a change to a specification from ceramic tiles to granite flooring for the lift lobby. The Changes requested involved a change of use as well as replacing a swimming pool with a garden. It was not the kind of requested change to which both parties could, without knowing if the authorities would approve the same or give approval with attached terms and conditions, agree upon unconditionally. Indeed, the request might be denied by the authorities. As both parties were represented by lawyers, their lawyers drafted the Letter of Confirmation to cater for this request for the Changes and specifically catered for a range of possibilities (see [19] above). As referenced above, this included the authorities refusing to approve the Changes, or approving the same and subsequently revoking the same, approving the Changes subject to terms and conditions which the appellant did not agree to or even accepting, in the appellant’s sole discretion, any terms or variations imposed by the authorities in order to grant approval for the Changes. The appellant undertook to give notice in writing to the respondent if any of these eventualities occurred whereupon the respondent would have 14 days within which to rescind the SPAs and obtain a refund of all progress payments, if it wished to do so. The Letter of Confirmation also set out the parties’ rights if the respondent did not rescind the SPAs.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Letter of Confirmation therefore provided for the parties’ legal rights vis-à-vis the requested Changes, which Form D does not provide for, but even then, the Letter of Confirmation did not and indeed could not, take away the protection afforded by cl 15.4 unless, as we have already noted, the prior written approval of the Controller was obtained. It is perhaps no coincidence that despite the exchange of correspondence on the requested Changes by the respective solicitors on their respective letterheads, the signed Letter of Confirmation was on the letterhead of the appellant. The right to rescind when the authorities responded was given to the respondents under the Letter of Confirmation and that right sat alongside the right conferred by cl 15.4. A knotty legal issue <span class="font-italic">might</span> arise where the respondent did not rescind the SPAs under the Letter of Confirmation but attempted to do so after the expiry of 14 days, under cl 15.4. Technically, considering the purpose of the Act and the use of a statutorily-mandated form of contract, such a right must still exist; however, that issue is not before us. What is before us is the undisputed fact that the respondent could not be said to have agreed to the amendments consequent upon the requested Changes, because it did not know what they were, and there is no evidence to suggest it had agreed to a blanket acceptance of all potential changes or conditions which could arise or be imposed. Nothing can be clearer from the terms of the Letter of Confirmation. The requested Changes therefore did and could not affect the respondent’s recourse to cl 15.4.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 What did transpire here, is that for some reason, the appellant did not, as it undertook to do under the Letter of Confirmation, give notice to the respondent upon hearing back from the authorities. As mentioned above, to comply with the authorities’ requirements, there would have to be substantial changes made to the hardscape and softscape areas, the raising of the softscape areas and reduction in the occupant load of Unit 2, (see [23] and [25] above). The appellant went ahead with construction in accordance with these requirements. The respondent discovered these differences only after they took possession of the Units on 29 December 2016. Shortly thereafter the disputes arose which eventually led to the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 These changes were found by the arbitrator to be “substantial differences” for the purposes of cl 15.4 and, as discussed above, this was a finding that the appellants have to live with. As we shall elaborate below, it is not open to the appellants to ignore or attempt to say otherwise before the courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 We pause at this juncture to deal with a point made by counsel for the appellant, Mr Kelvin Poon, during oral submissions. Mr Poon submitted that the 2014 URA Plan (which featured the changes set out at [28] above) was sent to the respondents on 21 January 2015 and the respondents “did not make any noise about it”. We then asked Mr Poon if that point was put before the arbitrator but Mr Poon was not able to confirm that as he was not counsel for the appellant at the arbitration. However, Mr Lok Vi Ming SC, counsel for the respondent, confirmed that the 2014 URA Plan did not feature in the arbitration proceedings and no witnesses were cross-examined on this point. This point was only raised by the appellant in its <span class="font-italic">reply </span>submissions to the arbitrator, where the appellant exhibited the 2014 URA Plan. As the reply submissions were simultaneously exchanged, the respondent did not have a chance to address this point. The arbitrator and the Judge, correctly in our view, did not make any findings on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In our view, this is not a permissible point to run before us. It was not raised in the arbitration below and no witnesses were cross-examined on the 2014 URA Plan or on the point being put forward before us. Both only appeared in the reply submissions which were simultaneously exchanged. As Mr Lok SC rightly points out, it does not form any part of the five questions of law and we thus disregard it.                    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It should also be noted that the respondent did not run a case before the arbitrator that there had been a breach of the Letter of Confirmation by the appellant and that they had suffered loss and damage as a result of that breach. This will have a consequence on what damages it can recover (see [119] below); but as far Question 2 goes (grounded as it is on erroneous premises), the respondent has not lost its right to rely on cl 15.4 in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The interpretation of “differ substantially”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We now go on to deal with the interpretation of the phrase “differ substantially” (“Phrase 2”) to the extent needed to answer Questions 3 and 4 ([36] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Question 3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Question 3 asks the broad question of what constitutes a “substantial difference” in cl 15.4 (see [31] to [36] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Findings below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The appellant argued below that the differences which are significant for the inquiry under cl 15.4 must be those which have a demonstrable impact on the commercial value of the units.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Those cases concern contracts for the sale of real property which contain a “non-termination clause” to the effect that the contract would not be vitiated notwithstanding any misdescription in the property (see for example <span class="font-italic">Flight v Booth</span> (1834) 1 Bing (NC) 370; <span class="font-italic">Jacobs v Revell</span> [1900] 2 Ch 858; <span class="font-italic">Lee v Rayson</span> [1917] 1 Ch 613; and <span class="font-italic">Shepherd v Croft</span> [1911] 1 Ch 521). Despite the non-termination clause, the court in those cases laid down a common law exception that the purchaser would be allowed to terminate the contract if the misdescription was substantial or material. The precise terminology of the exception differed from case to case, with some cases finding that rescission would be allowed if the purchaser did not <span class="font-italic">substantially</span> get what he bargained for, and other cases finding that rescission would be allowed if <span class="font-italic">but-for</span> the misdescription, the purchaser would not have entered into the contract, amongst others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 However, we do not think that those cases are of much assistance in the present case. None of them concerned a clause like cl 15.4 of Form D and were not decided in the context of legislation specifically enacted to protect purchasers. While they similarly refer to tests of substantiality and materiality, we do not think they are particularly relevant or helpful in construing the phrase “differ substantially” in cl 15.4 in the context of the legislative scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Instead, we should look to the purpose of the Act, which has been made clear by Parliament. It is not in dispute that the purpose is purchaser protection. Parliament saw fit not to define what is meant by “differ substantially”. That is probably because there are so many different facts and circumstances that can arise, and these factors or considerations may well differ in importance and significance depending on the facts of each particular case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 It would not be wise for us to attempt something that Parliament saw fit not to do. We already have two signposts: (a) the purpose of the Act; and (b) the use of the words “differ substantially.” We therefore will not go beyond saying the following in the context of this case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What amounts to a substantial difference is an objective rather than a subjective test which assesses whether a <span class="font-italic">reasonable person</span> in the situation of the parties would have thought the two comparative plans, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plan at the time of the agreement and the final approved building plan, differed substantially;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It would be relevant to consider the question of whether a difference is “substantial” from the perspective of <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties but a greater weight should be placed on the perspective of the purchaser because cl 15.4 is primarily to protect the purchaser; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The inquiry includes all the relevant factors and circumstances of the case, including but not limited to aesthetics, use restrictions, commercial, utilitarian, and social considerations and values.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The foregoing is sufficient to deal with Question 3. Clause 15.4 provides that if there is any dispute as to whether the unit when built differs substantially from the approved plans and specifications, it shall be referred to arbitration. The dispute has been referred to an arbitrator and he found and ruled that the final approved building plans differs substantially from the plans and specifications approved by the respondent at the date of the SPAs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 2012 BCA Plan. The arbitrator noted the four differences (see [32(b)] above), which he considered differed substantially from the 2012 BCA Plan. That should have been the end of the matter. None of the answers sought to the questions posed can change or impugn this finding of fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Unfortunately, the parties have made substantial submissions on the facts. This includes the appellant’s contention that the arbitrator had erred as there was no evidence that the increased height of the softscape impacted the Units’ commercial value.

</div> These are impermissible arguments. We reject these and other arguments of the same ilk raised by the appellant. We reiterate that in an appeal on a question of law under s 49 of the AA, the appellants cannot, and have no basis to, contend that the arbitrator erred in his findings of fact. They may only appeal on a question of law based upon the facts as found by the arbitrator. We add that in our view, the arbitrator had given more than enough grounds, some of which we have already referred to above, to support his findings in this respect. The arbitrator’s approach was consistent with what we have set out at [99] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Question 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Question 4 asks what weight is to be given to the restrictions in cll 25 and 26 of the SPAs when considering what constitutes a substantial difference under cl 15.4 ([36] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Judge held that contractual restrictions are amongst the factors to be taken into account when comparing the plans and specifications approved by the purchaser (subject to the requested changes) with the final approved plans and the units as-built, to determine if there has been a substantial difference (<span class="font-italic">GD</span> at [170(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our Analysis and Decision on Question 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In our view, Question 4 is devoid of any merit.

The changes resulted in a substantial difference because the roof gardens could no longer be used even for non-commercial purposes. Our findings comport with the finding of the arbitrator who did not consider commercial purposes as part of his reasoning for finding a substantial difference. Instead, the arbitrator stated that there is a substantial difference, in spite of cll 25 and 26, because the softscape areas could not even be accessed for <span class="font-italic">non-commercial</span> activities (such as for a walk) (see [35] above).

The Chambers English Dictionary ascribes the meaning of “refund” as “to restore what was taken”. That is the more modern usage of the word “refund”, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, where A pays B a sum for something and upon rescission, B refunds that sum back to A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In our judgment, the purpose of cl 15.4 makes clear that the first meaning is the correct one to adopt. Clause 15.4 is not a breach or damages clause, but a risk allocation clause which operates in the event that there is a substantial difference between the approved plans and the as-built plans. Such a substantial difference is a variance from the agreement, and if this occurred, cl 15.4 operates to allocate the risk between them. Such variance is not necessarily due to any fault of either party but could happen, for example, due to the need to comply with regulations imposed by authorities. Since cl 15.4 is a no-fault clause, which does not require any form of breach or wrongful act on the part of the vendor, the concept underlying cl 15.4 is that of rescission and restitution. There is no conceptual basis for holding that the developer should be liable to insure or indemnify the purchaser from all losses, including payments to third parties. If this was what Parliament had intended, the more appropriate word to use would have been “reimburse” or “indemnify”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The respondent argues that making the developer liable for these third-party payments would offer better purchaser protection and would be in line with the legislative purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 However, in our view, the legislative purpose does not go so far as to indemnify or insure the purchaser from all losses. The wording and structure of cl 15.4 supports this construction. Clause 15.4(a) provides that if the purchaser terminates the sale agreement, the vendor must refund all moneys paid by the purchaser together with interest at 10% per annum. Clause 15.4(b) goes on to provide that upon payment, neither party will have any claim against the other. The legislative purpose is only to protect the purchasers from abuse, and not to hold them harmless from all loss and damage. Since cl 15.4 is a no-fault clause, there may not necessarily have been any abuse by the vendor and thus there is no reason for the vendor to indemnify the purchaser. There are thus little if any persuasive reasons supporting a different interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The respondent however points to the legislative history of the Rules to support the second meaning of Phrase 3. The respondent pointed out that (as referred to above) the predecessor to cl 15.4 of the Rules was cl 9(4) of Form D of the Schedule to the Sale of Commercial Properties Rules (Cap 281, R 1, 1990 Rev Ed) (“1990 Rules”) which provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the final approved building plans for the building unit and the Building differ substantially from the plans and specifications approved by the Purchaser at the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to determine this Agreement if he so desires, in which event <span class="font-weight-bold">all money </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">collected from him by the Vendor</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> shall be refunded to him in</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">full</span> with interest thereon at the rate of ten (10) % per annum and in such event neither party shall have any claim against each other thereafter. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 However, the relevant phrase of cl 9(4) of the 1990 Rules was replaced as follows in cl 15.4 of the Rules:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the <span class="font-weight-bold">Vendor must refund</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">all moneys paid by the Purchaser</span> with interest calculated at the rate of 10% per annum … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The respondent argues that the change in words shows that there is a shift in focus from moneys collected by the vendor to moneys paid by the purchaser, and was intended to manifest the intent to reimburse the purchaser all moneys paid by him, whether to the vendor or to third parties. We disagree. There is nothing in the legislative material to show that this change was intended. Instead, the phrase could have simply been amended because the earlier phrase contained superfluous words.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118  Our answer to Question 5 is therefore that Phrase 3 only refers to moneys paid to the vendor and it does not include sums of money paid to third parties. We therefore reverse the Judge’s findings on this question and vary the award pursuant to our power under s 49(8)(b) of the AA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant is to refund the respondent the progress payments for Unit 1 and Unit 2 as claimed in the schedule to the award, together with the prescribed interest. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In so far as the maintenance charges for the units were paid to the MCST and not to the appellant, the appellant is not liable to reimburse these sums to the respondent and the sums awarded in the arbitration for maintenance charges for Units 1 and 2 are set aside.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Note: It appears to us that the maintenance charges were paid to the MCST and not to the appellant, although the arbitrator did not seem to have made a finding on this (see for example MKP’s witness statement at RA III(4) 33 at paras 43 to 44 and the respondent’s opening statement in the arbitration at RA III(2) 179 at para 64; we also note that the respondent only started paying maintenance charges from January 2017 after they took possession of the Units in December 2016). </div>

As referenced above, the appellant had undertaken to give written notice to the respondent if various eventualities arose as a result of the requested Changes, (see [19] and [20] above). For some reason, the appellant failed to do so. Consequently, the respondent only discovered the differences after it was given possession of the Units. Had written notice been given earlier, it is probable that rescission would have occurred at a much earlier date and some of the payments to third parties like the MCST would not have been incurred or reached the levels set out in the award. We have also noted the appellant’s contention that the respondent can recover the stamp duty and property tax in the event of a rescission although that does not address the loss of interest suffered by the respondent from being deprived of these considerable sums for an extended period. The loss or damage flowing from a breach of the Letter of Confirmation may have addressed some of these claims but no such claim was pursued below.       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 We thus answer the first four questions of law as set out above in favour of the respondent.

We therefore allow the appeal in part.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 We conclude by emphasising, first, that in all sales of commercial property, developers should recognise the importance of keeping purchasers informed if there are substantial changes in the approved building plans, to avoid potential conflicts. Secondly, if the parties choose to make contractual changes to the prescribed standard form contract in Form D, they and their legal advisers should be mindful that such changes cannot take away the minimum safeguards afforded to purchasers under the Act unless, of course, prior written consent is obtained from the Controller.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As the appeal on four of the five questions has been dismissed but the appellant has succeeded on Question 5, we award costs to the respondent fixed at $50,000, all in.

The respondent purchased two units from the appellant, #04-01 (“Unit 1”) and #04-02 (“Unit 2”) (collectively “the Units”), pursuant to two Sale and Purchase Agreements (“SPA(s)”). The SPAs were based on Form D of the Schedule to the Rules, as the use of Form D was statutorily mandated by s 5 of the Sale of Commercial Properties Act (Cap 281, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) read with r 7 of the Rules (collectively “the legislative scheme”). Both SPAs stated that the building plan for Oxley Tower had been approved under No “A0642-00006-2010-BP01”. This was the serial number for a building plan earlier submitted by the appellant to the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”), and which was approved by the BCA in March 2012 (“2012 BCA Plan”). The 2012 BCA Plan showed that the hardscape areas (physical features such as concrete paths and walls) of the Units were level with the softscape areas (soil and vegetation). The appellant forwarded to the respondent BCA’s Notice of Approval which contained a qualifier that “clearances from the technical departments as indicated below are outstanding”, and one of the departments listed was the “Fire Safety &amp; Shelter Department” (“FSSD”). Unknown to the respondent, the appellant had amended the 2012 BCA Plan before sending it to FSSD (“2012 FSSD Plan”). In this plan, the appellant elevated the softscape areas by 300mm above the hardscape areas, and also increased the size of the softscape areas, correspondingly reducing the size of the hardscape areas.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Alongside the SPAs, parties also entered into a Letter of Confirmation where the appellant agreed to: (a) convert the use of Unit 1 from a gym/spa to a restaurant; and (b) remove the swimming pool in Unit 1 and convert it into a garden (collectively the “Changes”). However, the appellant reserved its right to refuse to effect the Changes if the authorities: declined to approve them; approved them subject to terms and conditions it did not agree to; or approved the Changes but subsequently revoked their approval. The appellant also reserved its right to accept in its sole discretion any terms and variations imposed by the authorities in order to grant approval for the Changes. Nevertheless, the Letter of Confirmation required the appellant to give notice in writing to the respondent if any of these situations occurred, and upon receiving such a notice, the respondent was entitled to rescind the SPA within 14 days and be refunded all progress payments.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 At some point, the appellant realised that the Changes would require corresponding changes to the Units in order to comply with FSSD’s requirements. In May 2014, the appellant submitted a redesigned plan to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) to seek approval for the change of use of Unit 1 from a gym/spa to a restaurant (“2014 URA Plan”). In the redesigned plan, the softscape areas were substantially increased, and the hardscape areas were correspondingly reduced, as compared to the 2012 FSSD Plan. In August 2016, the appellant submitted “as-built plans” to BCA (“2016 BCA Plan”),  and in November 2016, the appellant submitted the final fire-safety plans to FSSD (“2016 FSSD Plan”). These appeared to be identical to the 2014 URA Plan (collectively “Final Approved Plans”).  </div><div class="txt-body text-left">4 All this while, the appellant never provided any notice to the respondent pursuant to the Letter of Confirmation. After the respondent took possession of the Units, it discovered the changes that had been made to the Units. The respondent thus sought to terminate the SPAs and seek refund from the appellant of all moneys paid by it to the appellant and to third parties, pursuant to cl 15.4 of the SPAs. As the appellant refused to refund the respondent, the respondent referred the dispute to arbitration.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The arbitrator found that there were substantial differences between the 2012 BCA Plan subject to the Changes on the one hand, and the Final Approved plans on the other hand. The arbitrator hence terminated the SPAs and ordered the appellant to reimburse the respondent all payments it had made to the appellant and to third parties.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The appellant filed an appeal to the High Court pursuant to s 49 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“AA”) raising five questions of law. The questions involved the interpretation of three phrases in cl 15.4 of Form D. The High Court found against the appellant on all five questions and dismissed the appeal. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court of Appeal’s</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">8 Terms in standard form contracts imposed on parties by statute have to be construed as legislation rather than as contract. Not doing so would mean that the parties could subjectively defeat the legislative intent underlying these mandatory terms and would render it pointless for Parliament to have required these terms to be included: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[47]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">9 The essence of Question 1 was whether the requirements imposed by the technical departments were part of the plans and specifications approved by the purchaser at the date of the agreement, where the BCA had approved building plans for a commercial property subject to outstanding clearances from the technical departments: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">10 The court held that what plans and specifications had been “approved” by the purchaser of a commercial property within the meaning of cl 15.4 of the Rules was a question of fact which must depend on the circumstances of each case. This was to be assessed based on the purchaser’s knowledge, actual or constructive, and his state of mind at the date of the agreement. The plans and specifications approved by the purchaser did not necessarily have to be consolidated in some written form, as long as there was some evidence as to what the purchaser had approved or deemed to have approved, at the relevant time. A purchaser also cannot be deemed to have approved changes that were not yet in existence at the time of the agreement. This was so even if those plans and specifications carried a notice that clearances from certain technical departments were outstanding: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">11 This view was supported by the general legislative purpose of the Act, and the specific legislative purpose of cl 15.4 of Form D. The general purpose of the legislative scheme was to protect purchasers against developers conducting sales of commercial units in an inequitable manner. Further, cl 15 of Form D was a form of positive purchaser protection which positively allocated to the developer the full risk of a cost increase arising from a change in the specifications and plans, while allocating to the purchaser the full benefit of a cost reduction arising from such a change: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">12 Question 2 asked whether a purchaser of commercial property under construction would be entitled to rely on cl 15.4 if he requested that changes be made to specifications of the unit but had not <span class="font-italic">formally</span> approved of the plans and specifications incorporating the changes he has requested, or whether he is left to his remedies at common law: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[78]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">13 The court found that the respondent’s emphasis on a <span class="font-italic">formally</span> approved set of plans or specifications was misplaced. As stated by the court at <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]</span>, “approval” did not necessarily have to be consolidated in some written form, as long as there was evidence of what the purchaser had approved or was deemed to have approved at the date of the agreement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[80]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">14 Question 3 asked what constituted a “substantial difference” within the meaning of cl 15.4 of the Rules. The court held that this was an objective rather than a subjective test which assessed whether a reasonable<span class="font-italic"> </span>person in the situation of the parties would have thought the two comparative plans, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plan at the time of the agreement and the final approved building plan, differed substantially. It would be relevant to consider this from the perspective of both parties but a greater weight should be placed on the perspective of the purchaser because cl 15.4 is primarily to protect the purchaser. The inquiry included all the relevant factors and circumstances of the case, including but not limited to aesthetics, use restrictions, commercial, utilitarian, and social considerations and values: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[91]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[99]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">15 Question 4 asked what weight was to be given to the restrictions in cll 25 and 26 of the SPAs when considering what constitutes a substantial difference under cl 15.4. For reference, cll 25 and 26 prohibited the use of the roof gardens in the Units for commercial activities and as spill-over space for restaurant customers. The court held that the question was devoid of merit as it was a fact-specific question which did not raise any question of law: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[104]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[106]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">16 Question 5 inquired as to the meaning of the phrase “refund all moneys paid by the purchaser” in cl 15.4 of Form D. There were two possible meanings being contended. First, that the phrase referred only to moneys paid to the vendor. Second, that the phrase referred to all moneys paid by the purchaser, whether to the vendor or to third parties: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">17 The court held that the phrase did not include reimbursement for payments made to third parties. Clause 15.4 was not a breach or damages clause, but a risk allocation clause which operated in the event that there was a substantial difference between the approved plans and the as-built plans. Such substantial difference was a variance from the agreement, and if this occurred, cl 15.4 operated to allocate the risk between them. Such variance was not necessarily due to any fault of either party but could happen, for example, due to the need to comply with regulations imposed by authorities. Since cl 15.4 was a no-fault clause, which did not require any form of breach or wrongful act on the part of the vendor, the concept underlying cl 15.4 was that of rescission and restitution. There was thus no conceptual basis for holding that the developer should be liable to insure or indemnify the purchaser from all losses, including payments to third parties. If this was what Parliament had intended, the more appropriate word to use would have been “reimburse” or “indemnify”: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[111]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[118]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left">18 The court thus varied the arbitral award such that the appellant only needed to refund the respondent the progress payments for the Units together with the prescribed interest, but not the payments made to third parties: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[118]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left">19 The court also noted that the appellants had raised various arguments which challenged or ignored the arbitrator’s findings of fact, and had interwoven arguments on points which had not been raised before the arbitrator. This was impermissible, as s 49 of the AA only allowed an appeal on questions of law arising from the award, and was not an avenue for a backdoor appeal of the award: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[4]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[6]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The court awarded costs to the respondent fixed at $50,000, all in, because although the appellant succeeded on Question 5, the appeal on the remaining four questions had been dismissed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[122]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
