First, he claimed that the default judgment was irregularly obtained because the writ had not been served at Gilcom’s registered address. Second, he claimed that Gilcom had a good defence to LRG’s claim because LRG had sued the wrong party. The gist of this defence was that Gilcom’s liability under the MOA was to refund the US$7m to AAFH – not LRG – and it was AAFH that was liable to refund the money to LRG.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As for the court’s exercise of discretion under s 279(1) of the Companies Act, without trying to be exhaustive, three broad principles can be extracted from the cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The first principle is that an applicant for a stay has to show that the state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exists. Where the winding up was on the ground of insolvency, the applicant has to show that the company is solvent: <span class="font-italic">In the matter of Glass Recycling Pty Ltd</span> [2014] NSWSC 439 (“<span class="font-italic">Glass Recycling</span>”) at [18]; <span class="font-italic">Doolan, in the matter of MIH Company Pty Ltd (in liq) v MIH Company Pty Ltd (in liq)</span> [2015] FCA 1130 (“<span class="font-italic">Doolan</span>”) at [10]. Credible evidence of solvency is required, not least because the court is putting the company back into operation. Mere assertions of solvency will not be sufficient. There must be proper verification of assets and liabilities; unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation will not ordinarily be probative of solvency: <span class="font-italic">Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb’s Excavations Pty Ltd </span>(2003) 45 ACSR 711 at [16]. It also bears mentioning that the ability to repay debts, presently due, at a future time does not demonstrate solvency: <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Leow Boon Cher and others</span> [2011] SGHC 228 at [79]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The second principle is that a stay would be refused if granting a stay would be detrimental to commercial morality and the interests of the public at large. In this regard, it has been held that</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where the company is insolvent, carrying on business and obtaining credit would present a grave commercial risk to persons dealing with it, and such companies should remain wound up: <span class="font-italic">Re Mascot Home Furnishers Pty Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[1970] VR 593 at 596; <span class="font-italic">Ting Yuk Kiong v Mawar Biru Sdn Bhd</span> [1995] 2 MLJ 700 at 708;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the court must be satisfied that it will be reasonable to entrust the affairs of the company to the directors under whose management the company had previously been subjected to an order for winding up. Therefore, a stay may be refused if there has been serious impropriety in the conduct of the company’s affairs, or any other matter which poses a risk to future creditors: <span class="font-italic">Glass Recycling</span> at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Doolan</span> at [11]. I would add that in my view, the applicant’s conduct in allowing the winding up order to be made or any unexplained delay in applying for a stay are also factors to be taken into consideration; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) where the directors have failed to comply with their statutory duties to give information to the official receiver or to furnish a statement of affairs, the court may refuse a stay until it is satisfied that the trading operations of the company have been “fair and above board”: <span class="font-italic">In re Telescriptor Syndicate, Limited</span> [1903] 2 Ch 174 at 182.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The third principle is that a stay would be refused if the interests of the creditors, the members and the liquidator are not protected: <span class="font-italic">Calgary </span>at 360; <span class="font-italic">Re Warbler</span> <span class="font-italic">Pty Ltd </span>(1982) 6 ACLR 526 (“<span class="font-italic">Warbler</span>”) at 532, 533. The application for a stay must be served on all creditors and contributories: <span class="font-italic">Warbler</span> at 533. A stay is unlikely to be granted if arrangements are not made to pay the creditors: <span class="font-italic">Re Allebart Pte Ltd</span> [1971] 1 NSWLR 24 at 26. On the other hand, if the applicant has demonstrated that there are reasons for a stay and the creditors, members and liquidator have consented to a stay, the court should seldom and only with good reason stand in their way: <span class="font-italic">Interocean</span> at [13].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I should add for completeness that the applicable statutory provisions in the cases referred to above are either substantially similar or identical (in the case of Malaysia) to s 279(1). In addition, although some of the cases involved voluntary winding up, the principles are equally relevant to cases involving compulsory winding up: see <span class="font-italic">Interocean</span> at [17].  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Reasons for not granting the stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Phang argued that a stay should be granted because (a) the winding up application had been based on non-payment of the judgment debt in S 121/2015, (b) there were good grounds to set aside the default judgment in S 121/2015, and (c) if the default judgment were set aside, then there would have been no reason for the winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my view, it could not be said at this stage that an application to set aside the default judgment in S 121/2015 was bound to fail. However, whether or not Gilcom might succeed in setting aside the default judgment in S 121/2015 was irrelevant. LRG’s application to wind up Gilcom may have been based on a statutory demand for payment of the judgment debt in S 121/2015 but ultimately the ground upon which the winding up order was given was that Gilcom was unable to pay its debts. To show that the state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exists (see [18] above) Phang had to show that Gilcom was in fact able to pay its debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Considerations of commercial morality and interests of the public (see [19(a)] above) also dictated that a stay should be refused if Gilcom was insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Therefore, I agreed with LRG and MCM that it was incumbent on Phang to demonstrate Gilcom’s solvency before a stay of the winding up would be considered. However, there was no evidence that Gilcom was solvent. Indeed, the evidence confirmed that Gilcom was insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, by Phang’s own admission, Gilcom did owe AAFH the US$7m. It was clear that Gilcom would be unable to pay AAFH unless the US$7m was first refunded by Allianz to Gilcom. During the hearing before me, Phang admitted as much when he submitted that Gilcom would be able to pay AAFH <span class="font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">Allianz refunded the US$7m to Gilcom</span>. Similarly, Gilcom’s repayment of its debt to MCM depended on it receiving a refund from another company. Second, Gilcom’s paid-up share capital was S$100,000
