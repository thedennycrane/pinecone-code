In any case, given that the messages were primarily updates from Alan, I accepted Bay’s evidence that he was more of a “receiver” of such messages. Being updates from Alan, they did not require any reply or earlier query from Bay in order to understand the matters on which Alan updated Bay. The absence of context did not detract from Alan’s SMSes pointedly showing that Alan himself made certain representations via SMS, that were similar to the verbal representations made by Alan (see [12] above). For example, the SMS of 17 October 2013 at 8.01am mentions Alan and Brendan meeting someone in order to effect the release of the Seized Sum. The other examples of Alan’s SMSes set out above are self-explanatory – they plainly show that Alan had made representations to Bay.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I found Bay’s explanation for why he did not have his own messages in the extracts, namely that his phone was an old model with limited memory space, to be reasonable. While Bay did reply “Yes, whatever” when asked whether the messages he deleted included messages that were adverse to him, the cross-examination that followed did not identify any adverse messages that he may have deleted. Nor did it support the view that Bay had intentionally deleted adverse messages to conceal evidence. Counsel for Alan claimed during the trial that Alan was not able to produce the messages from his handphone to show adverse messages as Alan’s phone was not functioning.

Even on Alan’s explanation, it may nevertheless have been the case that he did not dispute what was stated in the 27 July 2014 Agreement.

Moreover, Alan informed the police that Brendan was his “money partner” in his handwritten statements to the police.

While there was a slight difference in the amount Bay claimed for fraudulent misrepresentation (S$2,604,070.60) and the amount set out in the 27 July 2014 Agreement (S$2,575,302.00), it did not negate Alan’s signed acknowledgement in the 27 July 2014 Agreement that loans had been made by Bay to Alan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 While Alan sought to show using the Jervis emails that Bay did not consider Alan to be the recipient of the loans, these emails from Bay to his son were not intended to be a record of Bay’s legal position, in contrast to the 13 September 2012 Agreement and the 27 July 2014 Agreement. Thus, while the Jervis emails would be relevant in testing the consistency of Bay’s position(s), it would not be appropriate to examine them in the same manner and with the same rigor, as a contractual document. In any event, some of the Jervis emails also mentioned Alan together with Brendan (see [23(a)] above). Hence, the fact that Bay mentioned Brendan directly in some of the Jervis emails was, in my view, inconclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Furthermore, the fact that the Jervis emails and text messages (described at [58(a)] above) show Bay providing suggestions to Brendan, did not, without more, show that Bay had not acted or relied on Alan’s representations in providing the loans.

Bay claimed that he had lent Alan a total of S$2,604,070.60 while Alan claimed that Bay had loaned him a total of S$2,575,302.40. That meant that even by Alan’s records, he could not account for S$352,956.40. Bay submitted that Alan took the remainder for himself. This would have more than compensated Alan for the sum of S$160,440 that Alan personally loaned to Brendan which can be evidenced by receipts. Even if Alan were to be believed that he had personally lent S$205,710 (rather than S$160,440) to Brendan, that would mean that only S$2,177,076 of the amount transferred to Brendan was attributable to money obtained from Bay. This would leave S$398,226.40 unaccounted for (S$2,575,302.40 less S$2,177,076), which would have more than compensated Alan for the sum of S$205,710 that Alan claimed to have personally loaned to Brendan. Bay submitted that Alan would therefore have been recklessly careless of the truth of the representations that he made, as Alan stood to gain regardless of whether the representations were true.

</div> but he did not provide any explanation for why he informed the police otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Fifth, Alan did not provide any basis for believing the truth of the representations he made to Bay. He made representations about receiving information from or having meetings with representatives of government agencies, banks and law firms. It would have been well within Alan’s ability to verify the truth of these representations. It would have been plain to Alan whether he and Brendan in fact received any information or convened any meetings, as Alan represented in his SMSes. Moreover, on Alan’s own account, some US$5m of his own money were part of the Seized Sum. He would have had an incentive to verify the truth of the information he purportedly received from Brendan. However, despite having both the opportunity and the incentive to verify the truth of his own representations, Alan did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Sixth, as set out above at [74], Alan had not provided any satisfactory explanation for what has happened to the sum of around S$352,956.40 out of the total amount loaned to him by Bay (using the figure Alan set out in his spreadsheet of S$2,575,302.40 as the amount which Bay loaned to Alan). There was no evidence that this sum of S$352,956.40 had been transferred to Brendan’s accounts, and the natural inference was that it remained with Alan. Alan personally benefitted from the loans and thus had every incentive to continue perpetuating the false representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Seventh, in addition to the above, I found Alan to be an uncredible witness: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Alan gave incredible answers on the stand.

The court endorsed the observation made in John Cartwright, <span class="font-italic">Misrepresentation, Mistake and Non-Disclosure</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd ed, 2012) at para 7-25 that the representor must show he had reasonable grounds to believe that the statement was true and the question was whether a reasonable person, given the circumstances of the case, could have “deduced the truth of the statement from the information available to [him]”. A representor would also be liable if he was wilfully blind to obvious sources of information that would have revealed the truth to him (<span class="font-italic">RBC</span> at [71]).

While it was true that Bay only sought contractual enforcement of the 27 July 2014 Agreement, that was not the only contract that he pleaded. He had also pleaded and provided evidence in his affidavits of the loans he had made during the material period, including the dates the loans were made and the quantum of the loans. It was not disputed that these loans were advanced pursuant to representations made by Alan. Alan’s defence was that he was just a mouthpiece for Brendan. It was not suggested by Alan that these loans did not constitute contractual agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Even if I accepted that Bay did not clearly plead that these loans were contracts, it was clear from the various references to the loans in the Defence, which Alan said were made by Bay to Brendan, that Alan was well aware that Bay treated the loans made as contracts and was claiming for their recission. Therefore, even if Bay did not explicitly plead that the loans were contracts, Brendan was not in any case taken by surprise and did not suffer any prejudice (see <span class="font-italic">Song </span><span class="font-italic">Jianbo v Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd and another</span> [2021] SGHC 217 at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Consequently, I found that the loans specified by Bay were contracts that were entered into pursuant to the misrepresentations conveyed by Alan to Bay, and s 2(1) of the MRA was thus applicable in the present case. For the reasons explained above (at [26]–[47]), I found that the misrepresentations conveyed by Alan to Bay had been adopted by Alan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I have dealt above with the losses suffered by Bay as a result of the misrepresentations (at [64]–[68]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I have also found above that Alan’s representations were made in the absence of any genuine belief that they were true (at [77]–[86]).

The elements common to claims in fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation are that there must be a false representation of fact, inducement and actual reliance (<span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin (HC)</span> at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The common elements have been dealt with above under my analysis for fraudulent misrepresentation, as has the issue of whether the breach (if there was any) had caused Bay damage. The outstanding issues in relation to Bay’s claim in negligent misrepresentation were whether Alan owed Bay a duty of care and if so, whether Alan breached that duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”), the Court of Appeal laid down the test to determine the existence of a duty of care in all claims arising out of negligence regardless of the nature of the damage caused (the “<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test”). This is a two-stage test comprising of, first, proximity and, second, policy considerations, which are together preceded by the threshold question of factual foreseeability (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [73] and [115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> test, there must be sufficient legal proximity between the plaintiff and defendant for a duty of care to arise. The focus is on the closeness of the relationship between the parties, including physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [77]). At [81], the court held that “[w]here A voluntarily assumes responsibility for his acts or omissions towards B, and B relies on it, it is only fair and just that the law should hold A liable for negligence in causing economic loss or physical damage to B”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Where there is a positive answer to the threshold question of factual foreseeability and the first stage of proximity is satisfied, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care would arise. Policy considerations should then be applied to the factual matrix to determine whether or not to negate this <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty. Relevant policy considerations would include, for instance, the presence of a contractual matrix which clearly defines the rights and liabilities of the parties and their relative bargaining positions (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Alan owed Bay a duty of care and if so if he breached it</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Bay submitted that Alan owed Bay a duty of care. In particular, Alan had informed Bay that there was a non-disclosure agreement (the “NDA”) that the CAD and the MAS required Alan and Brendan to sign. Alan further represented that if the NDA was breached, the CAD and the MAS would allegedly cancel the agreement to release the Seized Sum. As Bay did not want to risk breaching the NDA and scuppering the release of the Seized Sum (which he had loaned money to Alan to secure), Bay resorted to obtaining information only from Alan, whom he trusted at that point in time. Alan would have known this. Moreover, Alan told the police he was Brendan’s “money partner”. On the other hand, Bay did not know Brendan and had not met him. Bay only spoke with Brendan on four occasions.

This was in spite of the fact that Alan had direct access to the information that Brendan gave him.

There was no duty of care between Alan and Bay and even if there was, Alan did not breach it. Alan submitted that it was not foreseeable that Brendan was a scammer and that Alan would be his victim. Bay knew that all the information was given by Brendan, not Alan. In the email dated 12 July 2013 from Brendan that was forwarded by Alan to Bay, Alan did not make assurances to Bay but merely forwarded the email. Bay had spoken to and received assurances from Brendan. Furthermore, Bay had carried out his own checks and formed his own views, but decided to continue lending money to Brendan in the hope of recovering his loans. Finally, Alan submitted that policy considerations militated against holding fellow victims of a scam responsible towards each other.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I found that Alan owed a duty of care to Bay. I deal first with the threshold requirement of factual foreseeability. In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, the court rejected at [89] the submission that factual foreseeability was not satisfied because the respondent could not have foreseen the <span class="font-italic">kind of losses</span> suffered by the appellant. The question was therefore not whether Alan could have foreseen that Brendan was a scammer – the test of factual foreseeability does not require the specific <span class="font-italic">kind </span>of loss to be foreseeable, much less precisely <span class="font-italic">how</span> the loss would materialise. Instead, the question was whether Alan could have foreseen that Bay would suffer loss if Alan did not take reasonable care in ensuring the accuracy of his representations to Bay. I found that it would have been reasonably foreseeable to Alan that if the representations Alan conveyed to Bay were false, Bay may suffer loss because the money which Bay loaned to Alan in reliance on Alan’s representations (which was in turn loaned to Brendan) may be improperly dealt with or misappropriated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 There was also sufficient legal proximity for the duty of care to arise. Alan was the one who informed Bay of the non-existent NDA. This resulted in Bay hesitating to check with third parties out of fear that doing so would jeopardise the recovery of the Seized Sum. Bay did not know Brendan personally and had never met him in person. In the circumstances, I found that Alan voluntarily assumed responsibility for the representations he made to Bay. He would have known that Bay would rely on his information. In my view, Alan’s SMS updates to Bay about the alleged attempts to release the Seized Sum showed that Alan was aware of Bay’s reliance on him for information. Alan’s SMSes also showed that he felt responsible for the representations he made to Bay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Alan also submitted that as a matter of policy there should not be a duty of care imposed on fellow victims of scams as it would be unfair and would lead a flood of litigation. However, Alan had not proven in this case that he was a victim of Brendan, in the same manner in which Bay was a victim of Alan’s representations. In any event, I have found above that Alan had opportunities to verify Brendan’s representations but did not, and he adopted Brendan’s representations as his own. He assumed responsibility for them and engendered Bay’s reliance. In these circumstances, it would not be contrary to public policy to expect Alan to take reasonable care when making those representations to Bay. In my view, the imposition of a duty of care in the particular circumstances of this case would not open the floodgates of litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As the loss that Bay suffered was factually foreseeable, and both limbs of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> test are satisfied, I found that Alan owed Bay a duty to take reasonable care in making the various representations which he did to Bay. I also found that Alan breached the duty of care that he owed to Bay. Given that: (1) Alan was purportedly a party to the NDA; (2) Alan was much closer to Brendan than Bay was; and (3) according to Alan’s SMSes, Alan and Brendan allegedly met up on several occasions to attempt to release the Seized Sum, Alan was clearly in a position to verify the truth of the representations that he had made to Bay. However, he did not provide evidence of any attempts to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I therefore found that Alan was liable to Bay for negligent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of 27 July 2014 Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Bay also claimed, in the alternative, that Alan had breached the 27 July 2014 Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The 27 July 2014 Agreement contained, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following terms:

</div> and not because he wanted to obtain Bay’s forbearance. There was no evidence to suggest that there was an implied request on Alan’s part for Bay’s forbearance. Bay referred to the clause in the 27 July 2014 Agreement whereby Alan agreed to bear legal fees and other administrative expenses if Alan did not repay the outstanding amount by 2 August 2014. However, all that the clause showed was that Alan would be contractually obliged to indemnify Bay’s legal costs if Alan did not repay Bay by the stipulated date. It did not prevent Bay from commencing legal proceedings or making a police report against Alan. That clause thus did not form a sufficient basis to conclude that there was an implied request from Alan for Bay’s forbearance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I did not find there to be sufficient evidence of an express or implied request from Alan for Bay’s forbearance. Bay referred to Alan’s evidence of an incoming sum of S$19.875m and that Alan would not have wanted this to be affected (see [118] above). While this might have hinted at the possibility that Alan had an incentive for Bay not to sue or make a police report against Alan, it did not translate into evidence of an express, or even an implied, request for forbearance from Alan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In addition, Bay did not suggest in his affidavits that Alan had specifically or impliedly requested him to forbear from commencing legal proceedings or making a police report against Alan.
