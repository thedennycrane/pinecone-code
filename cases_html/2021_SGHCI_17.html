I explain the circumstances, and the reasons for the refusal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Originating Summons was filed in the General Division of the High Court on 6 April 2021. On 22 July 2021, the proceedings were transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court. At a Case Management Conference on 25 August 2021, by which date the affidavit evidence of both sides had been filed, directions were given for sequential written submissions and the hearing was fixed for 27 October 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiffs’ submissions and the defendants’ responsive submissions, both of which were detailed, were filed. The plaintiffs’ submissions in reply were due on 22 October 2021. On 15 October 2021, the plaintiffs’ solicitors applied pursuant to Order 64 rule 5(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for an order declaring that they had ceased to be the solicitor acting for the plaintiffs. The basis of the application was that, as further described below, the plaintiffs had not paid outstanding invoices and had not provided the requested deposit for fees and disbursements for the hearing. While ordinarily confidential between the solicitors and their clients, these matters became open for consideration in connection with the plaintiffs’ acknowledged financial stringency when applying for an adjournment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On 19 October 2021, an order was made as requested by the plaintiffs’ solicitors (hereafter, “the former solicitors”). The Registry emailed the plaintiffs directing that they inform the Registry whether they would be appointing new solicitors for the hearing on 27 October 2021. The response, on 20 October 2021, was a written request to extend the time for the submissions in reply and to reschedule the hearing “by at least 6–8 weeks” so that the plaintiffs could make alternative arrangements for representation. The email described why the plaintiffs’ “projects and revenue streams [had been] prejudicially and grossly affected” such that they “could not honour some of the fees payments” to the former solicitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendants emailed the Registry on 21 October 2021, objecting to the plaintiffs’ request. The parties were informed that the hearing date of 27 October 2021 would remain, and that if the plaintiffs were not represented by solicitors, their representative would be heard on any application for an adjournment. Arrangements enabling appearance by an appointed representative were made modelled on O 1 r 9(2) of the ROC. From the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Offshore</span><span class="font-italic">works Global (L) Ltd v POSH Semco Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 1 SLR 27 at [22] and [34], the plaintiffs as foreign corporations could not appear otherwise than by solicitors, but this expedient was adopted so that the plaintiffs could be heard on their request for an adjournment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The plaintiffs took up the arrangements. They replied to the defendants’ email by an email on 25 October 2021. All emails were before me on 27 October 2021 when the plaintiffs each appeared by their representative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is necessary to say a little more of the failure to pay the former solicitors. The default began in late July 2021, when the plaintiffs short-paid a May invoice by a little more than S$3,600 with a promise of payment in the next invoice. The early August invoice for a little under S$7,000 was not paid, nor was the earlier outstanding amount. A September invoice for a little under S$43,000 as deposit for further work and the hearing was not paid. There were a number of promises of payment, none adhered to, until on 13 October 2021 the former solicitors advised that they would be applying to discharge themselves. From as early as mid-August 2021, and repeated thereafter, the former solicitors had told their clients that if payment was not made by the promised time, they might suspend work and apply to discharge themselves.

</div> In my view, that was a key matter in relation to adjournment, giving weight to Mr Pillai’s submission last mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The amount outstanding to the former solicitors was not large, less than S$54,000, in comparison with the amount at stake being an award of INR195,00,00,000 (which is approximately S$35m) plus interest. Money was not found, despite promises, over a number of months prior to 27 October 2021. Effectively nothing was done to have representation from 13 October 2021, when the plaintiffs could not have been in doubt that they would lose the former solicitors, to 27 October 2021 – the asserted hope that the former solicitors would come back on board being shown to be hollow and not credible when even on 26 November 2021 no money was at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Even if an uplift be added for the new solicitors, a similarly relatively small amount had not been provided. That the plaintiffs had not put the new solicitors in funds, particularly when under the pressure of the hearing date of 26 November 2021 and the warning of a last chance on 27 October 2021, indicated that they were unwilling, but even if willing unable, to do so. Further, from the instructions as noted in the new solicitors’ letter of 25 November 2021, the plaintiffs had done nothing to approach Singaporean law firms in the period from 27 October 2021 to 8 November 2021; the letter refers to the Diwali public holiday in India in the week of 1 November 2021, but that was not a reason, in the circumstances, to fail to act in Singapore where (as Mr Pillai pointed out)

I accepted that the pendency of the Originating Summons in practice impeded them from enforcing the Award, and they should not have to abide by the plaintiffs’ willingness or ability to fund their representation. Balancing the matters put to me, I considered that the plaintiffs had sufficient accommodation by the adjournment from 27 October 2021, and that a case for further adjournment had not been made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 After I refused the application, Mr Chow asked for and was given a short adjournment in order to take instructions.

The disputes submitted for arbitration determine the scope of the arbitration. It is plain that the scope of an arbitration agreement in the broad sense is not the same as the scope of the submission to arbitration. The former must encompass the latter, but the converse does not necessarily apply, in that the particular matters submitted for arbitration may not be all the matters covered by the arbitration agreement. The parties to an arbitration agreement are not obliged to submit whatever disputes they may have for arbitration. Those disputes which they choose to submit for arbitration will demarcate the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal in the arbitral proceedings between them. An arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to resolve disputes which have not been referred to it in the submission to arbitration. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As described below, the plaintiffs’ submissions on jurisdiction (in which I do not include their submission on arbitrability) were not concerned with what disputes, or what issues within a dispute, had been submitted to arbitration. They challenged the applicability of the agreement to submit disputes to arbitration, contending that the defendants’ claims in the arbitrations were within the ambit of the arbitration agreements in the SSHAs rather than those in the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement.

That is remote from the present case. In the sentence on which the plaintiffs relied, the Judge paraphrased <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as saying that at the core of the class of disputes not capable of settlement by arbitration “are disputes which are of a public character and disputes whose outcome will affect the interests of persons beyond the immediate disputants”.

However, it remains necessary to consider whether in the particular case the presumption of arbitrability has been rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 More instructive in relation to the present case, in which the plaintiffs invoked Haldia’s insolvency proceedings, is the Judge’s consideration (at [150]–[153]) of <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil.</span> A company’s liquidators claimed to avoid payments made under a management agreement. The refusal of a stay in favour of arbitration under an arbitration clause in the management agreement was upheld by the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the claim was not arbitrable amongst other reasons. His Honour pointed to the distinction drawn in <span class="font-italic">Larsen Oil </span>between a dispute arising only upon insolvency and by reason only of the insolvency regime, and a dispute arising from the insolvent company’s pre-insolvency rights and obligations. The former was held to be not arbitrable; the latter was considered to be arbitrable, at least where the substantive rights of the creditors were not affected. Bearing these in mind, simply referring to Haldia’s insolvency proceedings will not do. The dispute must be examined to see whether it arises from or its determination is subject to the insolvency regime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The plaintiffs’ written submissions did not expand upon the bald assertion that the legality or otherwise of the transaction had an impact on the regulators and other stakeholders with an interest in Haldia’s insolvency proceedings; they did, however, expressly abandon the contention that Indian law provides for a particular dispute resolution mechanism to cover the defendants’ claims in the arbitrations. The reply submissions added the equally bald assertion that the outcome of the dispute would have “an impact of a public nature considering that [SEPC] is a public limited company”.

</div> The moratorium was declared on 11 July 2017, as part of the insolvency proceedings, by the National Company Law Tribunal at Chennai. The plaintiffs submitted that the Tribunal erred in dealing with the dispute despite the Chennai tribunal’s direction, which the plaintiffs stated as the direction that “no Court or arbitration proceedings could be commenced in respect of, or involving, Haldia (including any share transfers)”.

</div> It did not impede the commencement or continuation of the arbitrations, to which Haldia was not a party, nor was it submitted to the Tribunal in the non-arbitrability part of the jurisdictional challenge that it did. Secondly, even if the direction had been as stated by the plaintiffs, I do not see why that would have rendered the dispute non-arbitrable. The question in rebutting the presumption of arbitrability is whether the dispute is of a kind that must be resolved by a process other than arbitration. That question is not answered by an embargo on any process of resolution at all; the embargo may mean that the arbitrations were irregularly commenced or continued, but that is a different matter. Thirdly, the order admitting Haldia into the insolvency proceedings and the moratorium were set aside by the Appellate Tribunal on 19 July 2018 – as was pointed out in the defendants’ written submissions and referred to in a separate segment of the plaintiffs’ reply submissions.

</div> This was a new matter to which the defendants have not had the opportunity to respond, and it should not be permitted. In any event, as stated above, I do not see why that would have rendered the dispute non-arbitrable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Returning to <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [76] and the assertion of an impact on various entities, the dispute did not arise from Haldia’s rights and obligations at all, whether pre-insolvency process or post-insolvency process. It was not a party to the arbitrations and no relief was sought against it. The submission had to be to the effect that the dispute was not arbitrable because it required a decision of whether the transaction was legal or illegal, and permitting that decision to be made by the Tribunal would offend public policy because of the impact on the other parties, on Haldia, and on the unidentified regulators and other stakeholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiffs’ written submissions included argument for the contention that the “underlying transaction” was illegal and/or void because of violation of the FEMA and the regulations thereunder and of s 67 of the CA. The Tribunal has held otherwise in response to illegality arguments, once in dismissing the jurisdictional challenge and definitively in the Award. I do not think that the merits of the contention arises in my considering arbitrability, because the question is whether the dispute, relevantly that part of it in which the illegality or otherwise of the transaction is in issue, can be resolved by arbitration, and that question is not answered by deciding the issue by saying whether there is or is not illegality. In any event, while I see no reason to disagree with the Tribunal’s rejection of the contention, there is no substance in the submission that the dispute is not arbitrable because it requires a decision on illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 To repeat, Haldia is not a party to the arbitrations and not bound by a decision on illegality. Nor are any of the other parties to the various agreements apart from the plaintiffs and the defendants. There may or may not be an economic effect on them of the outcome in the arbitrations, or of the decision on illegality, but that does not make the dispute non-arbitrable. Disputes over the illegality of a transaction are not uncommon in arbitral proceedings, and there is no reason why they cannot be decided by an arbitrator instead of a judge. The regulators or other stakeholders, whatever that may mean, are no more or less affected by an arbitrator’s decision than by a judge’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The presumption of arbitrability is not rebutted.

In the full discussion by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">hina Machine</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [88]–[89], it is said that the expression of the right to be heard in Article 18 of the Model Law, providing that each party “shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case”, finds teeth in Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law and s 24(b) of the IAA, and the requirements of Article 18 are described at [90] as embodying basic notions of fairness and fair process.

An award obtained in proceedings conducted in breach of Art 18 is susceptible to annulment under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law and/or s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The Art 18 right to a ‘full opportunity’ of presenting one’s case is not an unlimited one.

The overarching inquiry is whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair, and the proper approach a court should take is to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) In undertaking this exercise, the court must put itself in the shoes of the tribunal. This means that: (i) the tribunal’s decisions can only be assessed by reference to what was known to the tribunal at the time, and it follows from this that the alleged breach of natural justice must have been brought to the attention of the tribunal at the material time; and (ii) the court will accord a margin of deference to the tribunal in matters of procedure and will not intervene simply because it might have done things differently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 More generally as to setting aside an arbitral award for breach of natural justice under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, the party must establish (a) which rule of natural justice was breached; (b) how it was breached; (c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach could or did prejudice the party’s rights: <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp;</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”) at [29]; <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">hina Machine </span>at [86].

</div> From the Tribunal’s reasons, the plaintiffs’ submissions had now included a procedural complaint. In the reasons, the Tribunal summarised the plaintiffs’ “objections” as that PO 1 did not contemplate the admission of expert evidence on questions of law; that the expert evidence mechanism was not suited to dealing with questions of law; that the Tribunal should not delegate the determination of Indian law or the application of Indian law to an expert witness; and that consideration of costs and time warranted the exclusion of Mr Nankani’s report. At this point still, it was not said by the plaintiffs that receiving the report would be contrary to the positive of an <span class="font-italic">agreed and contemplated</span> procedure: the complaint was the negative, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that its receipt was <span class="font-italic">not contemplated</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120  The Tribunal said that PO 1 did not preclude the submission of expert evidence on questions of Indian law, referring to the paragraph stating that the parties may offer the testimony of expert witnesses. For reasons he gave, he said he was not persuaded that he could conclude that there was no utility in receiving Mr Nankani’s evidence or hearing cross-examination on the same. He said that Mr Nankani’s appearance at the hearing did not mean that his evidence would be accepted without question and that the plaintiffs, if they so desired, would be given a fair opportunity to confront Mr Nankani in cross-examination and make submissions on his evidence as well as put their own position on Indian law: there would not be a delegation of the application of Indian law to the facts to Mr Nankani. As to costs and time, he was not satisfied that Mr Nankani’s evidence would be of limited utility, and costs were not the only concern: the Tribunal had an obligation to ensure a fair, expeditious, economical and final resolution of the dispute, and in that regard the plaintiffs had not previously objected to Mr Nankani’s evidence and it would be unfair to the defendants to exclude it on an application made less than one week before the hearing. The fairest way forward was to allow Mr Nankani to appear at the hearing and for the parties to submit on the relevance, materiality and admissibility of his evidence in closing submissions.

The award issued on 7 January 2021 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Award</span>”) obliged the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants INR 195,00,00,000 in damages. The plaintiffs filed an originating summons (“<span class="font-weight-bold">OS</span>”) to set aside the Award.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 From 2010 to 2011, the defendants entered into two Share Subscription and Shareholders Agreements (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SSHAs</span>”), through which they subscribed to shares in Haldia Coke and Chemicals Private Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Haldia</span>”). The second plaintiff was a party to both SSHAs as one of the promoters, but the first plaintiff was not a party to either. Under the SSHAs, the promoters undertook to procure a listing event by 31 March 2014. If the listing event did not occur by then, there was provision for an exit mechanism, being an entitlement in the defendants to exercise one or a combination of a number of rights. If the defendants exercised some of these rights, they would be entitled to a 24% compounded annual rate of return on their total investment amount (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the 24% IRR</span>”). The SSHAs each included an arbitration clause in materially the same terms.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 A Listing Event was not procured by 31 March 2014, but none of the exit mechanism rights was exercised. Instead, in 2015, three Share Purchase Agreements (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the SPAs</span>”) were entered into between the defendants, the plaintiffs, and some others, pursuant to which the plaintiffs were obliged to purchase Haldia shares from the defendants for a total price of INR 200,00,00,000. Additionally, a letter agreement (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the First Letter Agreement</span>”) was entered into between the plaintiffs, the defendants and other parties, providing for the suspension of the defendants’ exit mechanism rights in the SSHAs, and the revival of those rights upon a breach of the plaintiffs’ obligation to make payment under the SPAs. The First Letter Agreement and the SPAs each included an arbitration clause in materially the same terms.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 As the plaintiffs only paid INR 5,00,00,000 and nothing thereafter, the defendants commenced the SIAC arbitral proceedings on 14 December 2017 pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the SPAs and First Letter Agreement. Notably, the arbitration clauses in the SSHAs, which provided for a different tribunal composition and arbitral procedure, were not invoked.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 In the arbitral proceedings, the defendants made two claims in the alternative in their Statement of Claim. First, it was said that the plaintiffs were liable to pay the defendants INR 401,00,00,000 in damages. This was calculated in accordance with the formula in clause 3(c) of the First Letter Agreement, being the 24% IRR less the amount paid under the SPAs. Second and in the alternative, the defendants sought damages amounting to INR 195,00,00,000, being the outstanding sums due to them under SPAs, or such sums as to be assessed by the Tribunal.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On 4 February 2020, the plaintiffs applied for an adjournment of the evidentiary hearing. The basis of the adjournment application was that their former counsel had “withdrawn” and the new lawyer had not received the papers. The Tribunal dismissed the adjournment application. On 25 February 2020, the plaintiffs applied to exclude the evidence of the defendants’ Indian law expert, mainly on the ground that his evidence pertained to legal issues. This application was dismissed as well.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On 7 January 2021, the Award was issued, obliging the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants INR 195,00,00,000 with interest. The plaintiffs filed the OS to set aside the Award, relying on the following grounds in their written submissions:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The First Letter Agreement provided that the defendants’ rights under the SSHAs would revive if the plaintiffs failed to pay under the SPAs. The defendants’ claims were based on that failure to pay and upon the revival of the SSHA rights. In particular, the defendants were claiming for the 24% IRR amount payable under the SSHAs, via clause 3(c) of the First Letter Agreement. As the dispute fell within the ambit of the SSHAs as opposed to the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement, it was the arbitration clauses in the SSHAs which should apply, not those in the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement. Hence, the Award was made in excess of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the Model Law</span>”)), and the composition of the arbitral tribunal as well as the arbitral procedure were not in accordance with parties’ agreement (see Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The dispute was non-arbitrable within the meaning of Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the Model Law. First, the underlying transaction was illegal under Indian law. The legality of the transaction would have an impact on third parties, in particular Haldia, but also on the regulators and other stakeholders with an interest in Haldia’s insolvency proceedings (Haldia was admitted into a voluntary corporate insolvency resolution process under Indian law in July 2017). Secondly, moratoriums were declared in India prohibiting the commencement of court or arbitration proceedings in respect of, or involving, Haldia and the second plaintiff.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The plaintiffs were unable to present their case (see Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law) and their right to be heard was prejudiced (see s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the IAA</span>”)). First, the Tribunal’s refusal to adjourn the evidentiary hearing meant that their newly appointed counsel only had less than a month to get up on the case and prepare for the hearing. Secondly, the Tribunal’s refusal to exclude the evidence of the defendants’ Indian law expert witness was contrary to an agreed and contemplated procedure for the parties to present legal arguments by way of submissions. Thirdly, the plaintiffs were also denied a right to be heard because the Tribunal awarded INR 195,00,00,000 as damages even though defendants had not submitted that they should be awarded damages for breach of the SPAs.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court’s grounds of decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 First, the defendants’ claims fell within the arbitration clauses in the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement, and not those in the SSHAs. The first plaintiff was a party to the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement, but was not a party to the SSHAs. There was also a clear claim for outstanding sums under SPAs in the alternative. Even as to the 24% IRR amount, the defendants were not exercising a revived right found in the SSHAs but claiming a separate entitlement under clause 3(c) of the First Letter Agreement for which the 24% IRR was part of the calculation. There plainly was a “Dispute” within that term in the arbitration clauses in the SPAs and the First Letter Agreement, as there was a disputed claim for damages for breach of the SPAs triggering the clause 3(c) entitlement or an entitlement to damages on the alternative basis (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">75</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Second, the presumption of arbitrability was not rebutted (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">93</span>]). The dispute did not arise from Haldia’s rights and obligations at all (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">90</span>]). Haldia, or any of the other parties to the various agreements, was not a party to the arbitrations and not bound by a decision on illegality. There might or might not be an economic effect on them of the outcome in the arbitrations, or of the decision on illegality, but that did not make the dispute non-arbitrable. Disputes over the illegality of a transaction were not uncommon in arbitral proceedings, and there was no reason why they could not be decided by an arbitrator instead of a judge. The regulators or other stakeholders were no more or less affected by an arbitrator’s decision than by a judge’s decision (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">92</span>]). As for the moratoriums, the moratorium in relation to Haldia did not impede the commencement or continuation of the arbitrations to which Haldia was not a party; even if the moratorium had that effect, it only meant that the arbitrations might be irregular, and that was a different matter from the question of arbitrability (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">88</span>]). The moratorium concerning second plaintiff would not render the dispute non-arbitrable too (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">89</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Third, the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ complaint relating to the Tribunal’s refusal to adjourn the evidentiary hearing. Plaintiffs’ counsel appeared to have been able fully to fulfil their role: they filed the relevant papers and participated in the hearings. There was no protest that counsel was prejudiced. The refusal of the adjournment was within the discretion of the Tribunal, which was in the position to assess the adequacy of the time available to incoming counsel (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">112</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">113</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The plaintiffs’ complaint regarding the Tribunal’s dismissal of their application to exclude the evidence of the defendants’ Indian law expert witness was without merit too. The Tribunal issued a procedural order which clearly contemplated that there could be expert evidence of Indian law by witness statement, and the plaintiffs did not protest that this was a departure from an agreed and contemplated procedure or complain that they were prejudiced through themselves not adducing expert evidence on Indian law (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">118</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">119</span>]). In fact, it did not appear that the plaintiffs were prejudiced: plaintiffs’ counsel cross-examined the defendants’ expert witness, were qualified in Indian law, and made extensive submissions on Indian law (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">121</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">122</span>]). The Tribunal explained the reasons for his decision, and his ruling was not outside what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal might have done (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">122</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Lastly, the Tribunal’s award of INR 195,00,00,000 as damages did not prejudice the plaintiffs’ right to be heard. This was part of the defendants’ pleaded case which was maintained in the course of the arbitrations, and the plaintiffs had full opportunity to respond to it (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">124</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ application to set aside the Award was dismissed (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">131</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
