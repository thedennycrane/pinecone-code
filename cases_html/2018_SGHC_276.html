The first defendant is their biological father (“the father”), and the second defendant is their (former) step-mother (“the step-mother”). The brothers and the father are the registered proprietors of a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 2 (“the Property”), which the step-mother is seeking a share of in the divorce proceedings between her and the father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The brothers’ application herein (“the Application”) is for a declaration that they are each entitled to a beneficial share of 33.3% of the value of the Property. In the alternative, they seek an equitable determination of the parties’ shares in the Property. The brothers also pray that in the event of a sale of the Property, the proceeds should be distributed to the parties in proportion to their respective shares in it, after deducting the outstanding HDB loan, the costs and expenses of the sale, and the legal and stamp fees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The father filed the writ for divorce against the step-mother on 10 November 2014. The interim judgment for the divorce was granted on the step-mother’s counterclaim on 31 March 2016. After the hearing before the Family Court on 24 November 2016, the order on the ancillary matters was made on 29 November 2016. The father was dissatisfied with the decision of the Family Court, and filed an appeal (HCF/DCA 164/2016) (“the Appeal”) on 9 December 2016. Subsequently, before the hearing of the Appeal, the interim judgment was made final on 15 December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The brothers filed the Application on 30 January 2018. They had previously applied unsuccessfully to intervene in the divorce proceedings in the Family Court (FC/SUM 3263/2017), and to set aside the decision of the Family Court on the ancillary matters (FC/SUM 3152/2017). The Family Court had ruled that the brothers had no beneficial interest in the Property, and that their names were added to the title to the Property to dilute the step-mother’s interest in the same. That decision was made in the absence of any documentary evidence of their financial contributions to the Property: see <span class="font-italic">TZQ v TZR </span>[2017] SGFC 40 (“the GD”) at [6]. These documents have since been admitted with the leave of the High Court on the application of the father (HCF/SUM 144/2017) for the purposes of the Appeal.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Also, on 6 March 2018, with the consent of the father and step-mother, an assistant registrar of the Family Justice Courts allowed an application by the brothers to intervene in the Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The preliminary issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Both the Application and the Appeal were fixed together for hearing before me. The brothers were represented by the same counsel in both proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the hearing on 4 April 2018, a preliminary issue arose as to whether the court should hear the Application at all. The step-mother submitted that the brothers, having been allowed to intervene in the Appeal, would no longer need to pursue the Application. This was because they would be bound by the decision in the Appeal, in which the court could deal with the brothers’ alleged interest in the Property for the purpose of the divorce proceedings. The brothers could not have two cases running at the same time. The brothers’ response was that they would take the same position in the Application and the Appeal. They added that the decision in the Application would delineate and preserve their alleged interest in the Property before the Appeal was decided. The father’s submission was that the brothers’ rights would be determined in the Application, but they would nevertheless be bound by the decision in the Appeal because of their intervention. He also submitted that in my appellate capacity, I could not exercise powers which the Family Court did not have.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I decided that the Application should be allowed to proceed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At the time of the hearing, the High Court had decided <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB and another</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1433 (“<span class="font-italic">UDA (HC)</span>”), holding that in proceedings under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“s 112 proceedings”), the court has no power to make direct orders against a third party claiming an interest in an alleged matrimonial asset: see <span class="font-italic">UDA (HC)</span> at [31]. I respectfully agreed with that ruling. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The High Court further held that the court has two options where a third party claims an interest in an alleged matrimonial asset. The first is to determine the interests in the asset but to make no order against the third party, either because (i) the court finds that neither party to the marriage has a beneficial interest in the asset, and therefore excludes it from the pool of matrimonial assets or (ii) there are “substantial matrimonial assets to be divided apart from the disputed asset”: see <span class="font-italic">UDA (HC)</span> at [14]–[15]. Option (i) was not available here because it seemed clear from the evidence that the father, at least, had a beneficial interest in the Property, and thus the Property could not be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. Option (ii) was also not available. The Family Court had ordered that the division of the matrimonial assets was to be achieved, either in whole or in part, through a distribution of monies in the father’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts. However, this was no longer possible as the father had withdrawn most of the monies that were to be distributed and expended them (see [19] below). The only significant asset left for distribution was the Property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The second option noted by the High Court was to stay the s 112 proceedings to allow the property dispute to be determined in a separate civil action. Here, the separate civil action had indeed been commenced by the brothers and, in the circumstances, I came to the view that I should hear it. I therefore proceeded to hear the Application. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) After the hearing on 4 April 2018, the Court of Appeal delivered its decision in <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB and</span><span class="font-italic"> another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">UDA (CA)</span>”) which broadly affirmed the rulings in <span class="font-italic">UDA (H</span><span class="font-italic">C)</span>. This fortified my view that it was appropriate to hear the Application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As the step-mother’s share of the Property would depend on what the father’s share of the Property was, I heard the Application before the Appeal, during which I also heard the brothers in their capacity as interveners. As noted above, this was before the decision in <span class="font-italic">UDA </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> was handed down. In <span class="font-italic">UDA</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated the following at [54]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Given that the third party cannot participate in those [s 112] proceedings, whilst he may ask for leave to intervene in the proceedings, <span class="font-italic">the only purpose of such intervention would be to notify the court of his interest and apply for a stay of the s 112 proceedings pending determination of his separate civil suit</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The brothers should therefore not have been heard in the Appeal after their application to intervene was granted, notwithstanding that they took the same position in the Appeal as they did in the Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Although the Application was brought to determine the parties’ respective interests in the Property, that matter was closely related to what had taken place in the marriage between the father and step-mother. Therefore, besides the history of the ownership of the Property, it was necessary to examine some details of that marriage, as well as events that took place before it. Indeed, a number of affidavits of the father and step-mother filed in the divorce proceedings were also referred to in the Application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The brothers were the only children from an earlier marriage entered into by the father. According to the step-mother, the father was married twice before their marriage but nothing turns on this.

They contend that the father was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and decided to add their names to the title to the Property in view of his ailing health. At that time, the step-mother had already moved out of the Property, and her interest in it was minimal.

However, now that the evidence has been placed before the court, after leave was obtained from the High Court, it should be considered in the determination of the brothers’ shares of the Property, which should be in proportion to their financial contributions to the Property.

</div> She points out that the brothers did not pay market price for their shares, and the consideration for the transfer of the Property to them was stated as “natural love and affection”.

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a).

If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)?

The court further held at [116] that payment of mortgage instalments <span class="font-italic">pursuant to </span><span class="font-italic">an agreement made when the mortgage is taken out</span> “will be ‘direct’ contributions to the purchase price and will give rise to a resulting trust”. For subsequent mortgage payments to amount to a direct contribution to the purchase price for the purpose of establishing a resulting trust, there has to be a prior agreement between the parties at the time of the acquisition as to who would pay for the mortgage. The court made clear at [117] that “in the absence of any such agreement, the payment of mortgage instalments or other financial contributions <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> to the initial acquisition of the property will <span class="font-italic">not</span> give rise to any beneficial interest by way of a resulting trust”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 With regard to renovation costs, while those incurred at the time of the acquisition of the property are regarded as contributions towards the acquisition of the property, those incurred years after the acquisition could not be so regarded: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span> at [26] and [27].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The brothers’ interests</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The brothers rely on <span class="font-italic">Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind v Lee Sai Khim </span><span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2011] SGHC 64 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind</span>”) in support of their submission that they had acquired a beneficial interest in the Property as joint tenants through their payments which discharged the Mortgage. They submit that they are therefore each entitled to a one-third share in the beneficial interest in the Property, with the father holding the other one-third share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind</span>, the plaintiff and one Lee Sai Kim (“LSK”) were the registered joint proprietors of a HDB flat. When LSK wanted to sell the flat, and the plaintiff refused, LSK served a Declaration to Sever A Joint Tenancy in respect of the flat on the plaintiff. The plaintiff then applied to the court for a declaration that she was the sole beneficial owner of the flat. In the course of the proceedings, LSK passed away and the action continued against the administrators of LSK’s estate. The High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim, holding at [23] that LSK held “a beneficial interest in the [flat] as a joint tenant which she acquired through [several payments]”. The court further noted the general rule that upon severance of a joint tenancy, the parties take equal shares of the property, but considered that it was not necessary to determine the beneficial ownership of the flat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The flat was originally purchased in or around 1985 in the names of the plaintiff and her foster mother, Mdm Cheng, for $46,400. LSK, another foster daughter of Mdm Cheng, and LSK’s husband moved into the flat then. When Mdm Cheng passed away in 1991, the plaintiff became the sole registered proprietor of the flat. Towards the end of 1993, the plaintiff arranged for LSK’s name to be added to the title to the flat and in 1995, LSK was registered as a joint proprietor of the flat with the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 While the plaintiff initially denied that LSK had made any financial contributions towards the acquisition of the flat, she eventually conceded that LSK had made such contributions. The High Court accepted that LSK had contributed towards the property, by paying $20,000 for renovations when the flat was first purchased in or around 1985 and $100 per month towards the monthly payments and utility bills, and buying most of the furniture and fixtures. This arrangement had arisen because although LSK had wanted to purchase a property, her husband had not wanted to commit to a purchase. She then decided to make the purchase without her husband’s knowledge, and obtained the assistance of the plaintiff and Mdm Cheng to purchase the flat. LSK and her husband moved into the master bedroom when the flat was ready. After her husband died in 1989 and Mdm Cheng died in 1991, LSK requested the plaintiff to transfer Mdm Cheng’s share of the property to her, and she thus became a joint tenant. LSK also paid $13,288.61 from her CPF savings for the flat, as she and the plaintiff were required to redeem the existing mortgage on the flat before she could become a joint tenant. The plaintiff, on the other hand, had withdrawn $47,258.46 from her CPF account to pay for the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Although this decision appears to support the brothers’ submission that a beneficial interest in a property may be acquired through the discharge of a mortgage and other payments, the decision has to be understood in context. The plaintiff had added LSK as a joint tenant but claimed that the parties had agreed that LSK would only take the property after the plaintiff passed on. However, the court found it telling that the alleged agreement was not alluded to in a letter which the plaintiff had instructed her lawyers to send to LSK after LSK took steps to sever the joint tenancy. The court found that there was no such agreement, accepted that LSK had made contributions to the house, noted the addition of LSK as joint tenant, and on that basis, found that there had been an intention for LSK to acquire a beneficial interest in the flat, albeit the intention had been reflected as a gift in the transfer documents (at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The facts here are materially different. As will be explained below, unlike the facts in <span class="font-italic">Lee Hwee Khim Rosalind</span>, I find that while the precise legal effect of the addition of the brothers’ names as joint tenants had not been thought out between the father and brothers, the father’s intention was for the sons to take the Property only after he passed on. He had no intention that the brothers could acquire two-thirds of the Property in the event that it was sold prior to his death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There were two relevant junctures at which the Property was acquired in the present case. It was first acquired by the father in 1993, when the brothers were only aged eight and six respectively. Naturally, there could not have been any agreement between the father and them that they should be involved in making any mortgage payment, or otherwise financing the acquisition of the Property, that would only be performed in 2012, some 19 years later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 However, the brothers had acquired their legal interests pursuant to the Transfer on 2 October 2012, and the payments from their CPF accounts to discharge the Mortgage were made soon after on 10 October 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The brothers had received property in their legal names. They now claim they are joint tenants which would entitle them to 66.7% (rounded up) of the proceeds of the Property if sold, but through the discharge of the Mortgage using their CPF monies, they had only collectively paid out what amounted to 12.2% of the purchase price of the Property. I accept that the CPF monies were not intended to be loans to the father, as he had more than enough savings in his CPF account to discharge the Mortgage if he had wanted to, but were understood by all to be contributions towards the purchase of the Property. Otherwise, the brothers’ names would not have been added as legal owners. This distinguishes the current case from other cases where subsequent repayments of mortgage monies failed to count towards the payment of the purchase price of a property so as to establish a resulting trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, the brothers are not just claiming 12.2% of the Property. They are effectively claiming an additional 54.5%. Since I am not satisfied that there was an intention on the part of the person paying the purchase price for that portion of the property (the father) to benefit the recipients of the legal title (the brothers), the reasons for which are set out below at [56]–[62], a resulting trust arises. On the evidence, the father had wanted to give the brothers a share in the Property, and the brothers had made the financial contributions through the discharge of the Mortgage using their CPF savings, so that they could feel a sense of ownership (see [25] above). However, there was never any intention that the brothers could claim more than they had contributed, at least while the father still lived. This was understood by them all. Therefore, having ruled out the possibilities that the brothers’ CPF contributions were intended to be loans to the father, or that the father’s intention was for the brothers to have 66.7% of the Property either by way of gift (as stated in the transfer document) or sale (at an undervalue giving the brothers 66.7% of the Property for 12.2% of the original purchase price), and having found that the father and brothers did not have any specific intention regarding exactly whom the 54.5% would vest in, I come to the conclusion that a resulting trust arises. Accordingly, applying the first step of the approach in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, there is a resulting trust over the Property in the proportions of the respective financial contributions towards the purchase price of the Property as set out above (at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The step-mother’s alleged interest</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(112,48,160,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Although the step-mother does not have any legal interest in the Property, she claims that she has a beneficial interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The step-mother claims that the proceeds of sale of the flat that she bought using her share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial flat from her previous marriage were paid into a bank account which the father became a joint account holder of, and he had availed himself of the money. She further claims that $20,000 of that money was spent on renovations of the Property. The first claim was not supported by any documentary or other objective evidence. For the second claim, she relies on an invoice or receipt which actually shows that $200 was spent on servicing an air conditioning unit.

This finding is in issue in the Appeal, and will be dealt with there. For present purposes, even if I accept that $20,000 of the step-mother’s monies were applied towards renovations of the Property, that expenditure would not have given rise to any beneficial interest in the Property in her favour under a resulting trust. First, there was a long time lag between the acquisition of the Property and the alleged expenditure and consequently, the alleged expenditure could not be regarded as a contribution towards the acquisition of the Property: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui L</span><span class="font-italic">ian</span> at [24]. Further, the expenditure was not made pursuant to any agreement between the father and her when the father acquired the Property, whether in 1992 when it was purchased by the father and his then wife, or in 1996, when it was transferred to his sole name. Indeed, there was no allegation of such an agreement despite the step-mother’s explanation that the father did not arrange for her name to be added to the title to the Property because it was necessary to pay a resale levy of $20,000 to the HDB if she was so added.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Father’s affidavit of 18 July 2017, at para 26.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On the evidence of the father that is summarised at [25] above, while the father claims that he had wanted the brothers to have a share of the Property, it is not clear that he wanted to give them a one-third share each in the Property during his lifetime, even though he arranged for them to become registered proprietors of the Property with him. There was no express evidence from him that this was indeed his intention. Ordinarily, the indication of joint tenancy on the transfer document might have been taken as evidence of such an intention. However, I am unable to accept on the present facts that the information in the transfer document was reflective of the true transaction intended between the father and brothers. The transfer documents had indicated that the Transfer had been executed in consideration of natural love and affection. But as the evidence adduced in the Application showed, the father had intended that the brothers make at least some financial contributions. Given that the information on the transfer documents had already been shown not to be a true reflection of what the father and brothers intended in at least one aspect, the other aspects of the transfer document that the father and brothers relied on to show their intentions at the time of transfer could not be taken as conclusive proof of their intentions at the relevant time in the absence of corroborative evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 One of the reasons which the father gives for the Transfer was his health condition in 2012. However, I find it doubtful that the Transfer was made for the health reasons that he claimed. While the father initially submitted that he made the Transfer because he was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, the documents tendered in support of this claim showed that the earliest record of his cancer was in 2014. When this was pointed out, the father then submitted that he was unwell because of a traffic accident in 2011. Yet, as the step-mother highlighted, his injuries comprised non-displaced rib fractures, and he continued with the same job he had until he stopped work some years later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang v Wong Sang Woo</span> [2018] SGHC 162 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span>”), the High Court made the following observations at [46] and [47]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 Even if [parties] intended for the right of survivorship to operate upon the demise of one party in deciding to hold the property as joint tenants, <span class="font-italic">this did not mean that the parties also intended for the beneficial interest to held in equal shares, or in any particular p</span><span class="font-italic">roportion while both parties were alive</span>. The former discloses an intention that on the death of one party, the other would be entitled automatically to the property, rather than an intention to share in the property equally while parties are alive. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 In addition, the right of survivorship may entitle the surviving owner to a share of the property, but what is gained is only at law; it may be that even where the right of survivorship operates to make the sole surviving owner the sole registered proprietor of the property, <span class="font-italic">the survivor may not be entitled to the whole of the beneficial interest</span>. Such would be the case for instance where a resulting trust operates in favour of the deceased’s estate, which is not displaced by a common intention constructive trust, intention to gift or presumption of advancement (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 at [116]). Where co-owners have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property, how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned upon the death of one party is still to be determined by undertaking the steps set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>(see above at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I respectfully agree with these observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The same distinction between the intention for the right of survivorship to operate upon the demise of one party, namely the father, and the intention for the beneficial interest to be held in equal shares needs to be drawn in the present case. If the respective beneficial interests of the father and the brothers were indeed intended to be one-third each after the transfer, it would have meant that if either or both of the brothers wanted to sever the joint tenancy immediately and have the Property sold, the father would only receive one-third of any proceeds of sale, despite him having contributed some 87.80% of the purchase price of the Property (see [18] above). There is nothing in the evidence which indicates that the father would have countenanced this, even if the Transfer was executed because of the father’s health concerns. On the contrary, the cost of treating the cancer which he said he was diagnosed with would have militated against a finding that he intended to give away a major financial asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is clear that the father was more concerned with the disposition of the Property after he passed on than with giving the brothers a beneficial interest in it immediately upon the Transfer. As I have noted, the father’s evidence was that he was afraid that the step-mother would evict the brothers from the Property after his passing, and that the brothers made the financial contributions to protect their interest in the Property (see [25] above). On the father’s own evidence, it was more likely that he intended that they would acquire a right of survivorship in relation to his beneficial interest in the Property, and not a one-third share of the beneficial interest immediately upon the Transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In my judgment, the above considerations alone would suffice to dispose of the submission that the father and brothers had a common intention that they each have an immediate beneficial interest in one-third of the Property upon the Transfer. However, looking at the timing of the Transfer against the backdrop of the events that took place in 2012 (see [56] above), it could also be inferred that the father was taking steps to reduce the step-mother’s potential share in the matrimonial assets in the event that divorce proceedings were commenced. The marriage was failing rapidly. The step-mother had left the Property, and she had gone to court to seek maintenance from the father in September 2012. As this was not the father’s first divorce, he would certainly have been aware of how matrimonial assets are dealt with in a divorce. The Transfer was made on 2 October 2012. This view of the father’s intentions resonates with his stated intention of having the brothers make financial contributions to protect their interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Taking into account the above, I do not accept the step-mother’s submission that the brothers’ CPF contributions should be treated as loans (to the father). But I am also of the view that there was no common intention for the father and the brothers to each hold a one-third share of the beneficial interest in the Property in the lifetime of the father.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The step-mother’s interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As pointed out in [51] above, there was no evidence that there was any agreement for the step-mother to have a beneficial interest in the Property at any time after her marriage to the father. Therefore, taking the step-mother’s case at its highest, that the father had made use of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial property from her previous marriage and $20,000 of those proceeds had been spent on the renovations, it is not possible to find that there was any common intention that she was to acquire a share of the beneficial interest of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third step: Whether a gift was intended </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the third step of the approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, the inquiry is whether there is “sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid”: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [160(d)]. In the light of my analysis of the facts above, in my discussion of whether a common intention constructive trust arose, even if the father had intended to make a gift to the brothers, he did not intend to gift the brothers with a one-third beneficial interest each in the Property immediately upon the Transfer. It is far more likely that if the father had been asked at the time of the Transfer whether the brothers could sever the joint tenancy during his lifetime, and take one-third of the proceeds of the Property, he would have answered in the negative. If there was an intention to gift at all, on the evidence, it would have been an intention to gift them with a right of survivorship in the Property only. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fourth step: Whether the presumption of advancement applies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 A presumption of resulting trust may also be displaced by the presumption of advancement, which presumes an intention to gift having regard to the nature of the relationship between the parties involved: see <span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span> at [110].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal explained the interaction between the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust at [107]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… both the presumption of resulting trust and the presumption of advancement may feature whenever there is a legal joint tenancy in place and there are unequal contributions to the purchase price of the jointly-owned property. The presumption of resulting trust will operate in such a situation since equity abhors joint tenancy as a form of common ownership. The presumption of advancement, on the other hand, comes into play to displace the presumption of resulting trust where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Court of Appeal elaborated on the presumption of advancement at [59] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Just like the presumption of resulting trust, the presumption of advancement is “no more than a long stop to provide the answer when the relevant facts and circumstances fail to yield a solution” (see [36] above). It should be treated as “an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties rather than as an oft-applied rule of thumb”: see <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>”) at [29]. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Neo Tai Kim v Fo</span><span class="font-italic">e Stie Wah </span>[1985–1986] SLR(R) 48 (“<span class="font-italic">Neo Tai Kim</span>”), the Privy Council accepted that where the trial judge had found as a fact that there was a common intention that the property in question should be bought for the wife as the matrimonial home, the common intention <span class="font-italic">by itself </span>established the beneficial ownership and <span class="font-italic">precluded the operation of any presumption</span>. It is therefore apparent that the presumption of advancement will operate only where there is no direct evidence that may reveal the intention of the parties; only then will there be any necessity to <span class="font-italic">infer </span>or <span class="font-italic">presume </span>intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Court of Appeal added the following at [78]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The overall aim of the presumption of advancement is to discern the intention of the transferor …. In our judgment, two key elements are crucial in determining the strength of the presumption of advancement in any given case: <span class="font-italic">first</span>, the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of the relationship between the parties (for example, the obligation (legal, moral or otherwise) that one party has towards another or the dependency between the parties); and <span class="font-italic">second</span>, the <span class="font-italic">state </span>of the relationship (for example, whether the relationship is a close and caring one or one of formal convenience). The court should consider whether, in the entirety of the circumstances, it is readily presumed that the transferor or contributor intended to make a gift to the recipient and, if so, whether the evidence is sufficient to rebut the presumption, given the appropriate strength of the presumption in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The parent-child relationship between the father and the brothers in this case falls within the well-established categories of relationships where the presumption of advancement may apply. I therefore need to consider whether the presumption of advancement has displaced my earlier finding that the brothers’ beneficial interests in the Property are, pursuant to a resulting trust, limited to the proportions of their financial contributions against the total amounts used towards the acquisition of the Property. Having reviewed the evidence earlier in the analysis of whether there was a common intention constructive trust, I am of the view that the presumption of advancement that the father had intended to gift an immediate one-third share of the Property each to the brothers is also rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The father had originally claimed that he made the Transfer because he was diagnosed with cancer in 2012. As pointed out earlier (see [58] above), this was not borne out by the evidence which showed that the diagnosis was only made in 2014. Nor was the transfer likely due to the alleged effect that the 2011 traffic accident had on his well-being. Even if the father was concerned about his health, he was not likely to have given away two-thirds of his beneficial interest in the Property immediately, entitling the brothers to sever the joint tenancy and claim that larger interest if they decide to sell the Property. Instead, considering the evidence that he was afraid that the step-mother would evict the brothers from the Property when he had passed away, and that the brothers had made the financial contributions to protect their interest in the Property, the father had intended to confer on the brothers a right of survivorship so that the brothers would not be excluded from the Property when he passed on. The possibility that the father had attempted to reduce the step-mother’s share of the Property in the divorce also cannot be ruled out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Accordingly, I find that when the father made the brothers joint tenants of the Property with him, there was no presumption that he had intended to advance to each of them an immediate gift of a one-third share of the beneficial interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fifth step: Whether there was a subsequent change in common intention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The submissions in the Application centred on the intentions of the relevant parties up to and until the Transfer. There was no suggestion that there had been any subsequent change in the intentions of the father and the brothers, or the step-mother, after the brothers had been added as joint tenants. I therefore find that there was no subsequent common intention that the beneficial interest in the Property should be held in a proportion which differed from the position when the brothers’ names were added to the title to the Property in 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the result, I find that the Property is held on a resulting trust in the following proportions: 87.80% (father), 5.18% (first plaintiff) and 7.02% (second plaintiff). There was no common intention, whether immediate or subsequent to the transfer, that the brothers would be entitled to an immediate beneficial interest of one-third each of the Property subsequent to them being added as joint tenants. The father’s intention was, instead, for them to inherit his beneficial interest in the Property upon his passing. Given this intention, the presumption of advancement in the brothers’ favour would also be rebutted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the event the Property is sold in the father’s lifetime, the net proceeds of sale, after deducting the costs of the sale, would have to be distributed to the father and the brothers according to the percentages set out above. All three would have to refund to their respective CPF accounts the amounts which were withdrawn for the acquisition of the Property in accordance with the rules governing such transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I also find that the step-mother does not have any beneficial interest in the Property under property law. Any share which she may have will be determined under matrimonial law, and will be dealt with in the Appeal. The proceeds of sale in the event of the sale of the Property will also be dealt with in the Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Abdul Wahab bin Saul Hamid and Jovita Ann Dhanaraj (IRB Law LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Yeow Tin Tin Margaret and Jeanna Loe Yuqing (Hoh Law Corporation) for the first defendant;<br/>Seenivasan Lalita and Tan Li Yi, Caleb (Virginia Quek Lalita &amp; Partners) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
