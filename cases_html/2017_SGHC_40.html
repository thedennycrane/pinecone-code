The two, together with another conspirator, Huang Xiaomei (“Huang”), stole casino chips worth a total of S$100,225 from more than 60 victims on 284 occasions at the casinos and attempted to steal another S$7,925 worth of casino chips on 13 other occasions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Subsequently, Zhou and Luo left Singapore to return to China and brought various sums of money (S$1,000 and RMB6,800 in the case of Zhou and RMB4,500 for Luo) along with them. They were arrested slightly less than two weeks later when they returned to Singapore with the intention to commit further thefts in one of the casinos. The two were charged with the offences of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to commit theft under s 379 read with s 120B of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and removing proceeds of criminal activity from the jurisdiction under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), and punishable under s 47(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the CDSA”). I will refer to these charges as “the criminal conspiracy charge” and “the CDSA charge” respectively. The Prosecution proceeded on both charges against each offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The District Judge sentenced the offenders to an imprisonment term of 18 months each for the criminal conspiracy charge and an imprisonment term of two weeks each for the CDSA charge, with the two terms to run concurrently. Zhou and Luo were thus ordered to serve a total term of imprisonment of 18 months each. The Prosecution and the offenders appealed against the decision of the District Judge in the two sets of cross-appeals before me.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After hearing the submissions of both counsel for the offenders and the Prosecution, I enhanced the sentences of both offenders in relation to the criminal conspiracy charge to 24 months’ imprisonment but declined to run the sentences for the criminal conspiracy charge and the CDSA charge consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 According to the Statement of Facts (“the SOF”), Zhou and Luo, who were 41 and 37 years old respectively, were from the Jiangxi province in China. The two were acquainted from the time they were in China. Sometime in 2015, the two had plans to come to Singapore. When a mutual acquaintance, “Xiao Fu”, found out about this, he told them that he had a friend called “Xiaomei” in Singapore who earned a lot of money at the casino. “Xiao Fu” asked Zhou and Luo if they were interested in making some money. They expressed interest and were given the contact details of “Xiaomei”, who turned out to be Huang, on “WeChat”, an Internet messaging service. Huang subsequently established contact with Luo through “WeChat”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 18 September 2015, Zhou and Luo arrived in Singapore on social visit passes. Three days later, on 21 September 2015, they met Huang at the casino at Marina Bay Sands (“the MBS Casino”). Huang told them that they could make money by stealing casino chips from the patrons of the casino and using the stolen chips to gamble. Zhou and Luo agreed to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Thereafter, Zhou and Luo followed Huang to her rented accommodation, where she taught them how to steal casino chips by picking up chips from gaming tables using strips of double-sided sticky tape that were stuck on the inside of their palms. The plan was that they would target patrons who placed large bets using a stack of chips so as to minimise their chances of being found out. They would then work together, with one of them passing his or her palm over the stack of casino chips at the gaming table to steal the chips, and the others distracting the dealer and the patron. The agreement was that at the end of each day, they would give Huang a fifth of the value of the casino chips that they stole and divide the remainder.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Pursuant to this conspiracy, Zhou, Luo and Huang stole casino chips worth a total of S$100,225 from more than 60 patrons on 284 occasions between 21 September and 12 October 2015. Out of the 284 acts of theft, 264 acts were committed in the MBS Casino and 20 acts were committed in the casino at Resorts World Sentosa (“the RWS Casino”).

Luo brought RMB4,500 (equivalent to about S$912.64) and Zhou brought S$1,000 and RMB6,800 (equivalent to about S$1,379.11) on this return trip. These were a small part of the proceeds from their criminal conspiracy, and were the subject of the CDSA charges against them. They had spent the remaining money on gambling and other personal expenses.

They admitted that these were from the proceeds of their earlier acts of theft.

It submitted that such a sentence was necessary in order to achieve both general and specific deterrence. In particular, the Prosecution highlighted that the case was unprecedented in terms of the amount involved, the number of victims and the duration of the criminal enterprise. It also submitted that Zhou and Luo were foreigners who came to Singapore to participate in a sophisticated criminal enterprise, and were only caught because they returned to Singapore to perpetuate the offences. The Prosecution emphasised that this reflected that the offenders were not at all remorseful for their actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Prosecution urged the District Judge to take into account the fact that although it had proceeded only on a single charge of criminal conspiracy to commit theft for each offender, 297 acts of theft or attempted theft had in fact been committed as a result of their conspiracy.

</div> The Prosecution submitted that the sentence imposed for the criminal conspiracy charge should thus not be lower than the global sentence that would have been imposed had 297 charges of theft or attempted theft been brought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 As for the CDSA charges, the Prosecution submitted that a term of imprisonment of between two and four weeks would be in line with the precedents for the offence. It submitted that the sentences for the criminal conspiracy charges and the CDSA charges should be made to run consecutively for each offender as the two offences were conceptually distinct and protected different interests. The Prosecution argued that the criminal conspiracy charges related to the means by which the offenders acquired their criminal proceeds, while the CDSA charges related to them bringing the criminal proceeds out of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Counsel for the offenders agreed that the CDSA charges ought to attract a sentence of between two and four weeks’ imprisonment but did not agree that the criminal conspiracy charges merited that high a punishment or that the two sentences should be made to run consecutively. Instead, they submitted that the criminal conspiracy charges should only attract an imprisonment term of between six and nine months and that the two sentences ought to run concurrently as both offences formed part of the same transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In particular, counsel for Luo, Mr Justin Tan (“Mr Tan”), submitted that a sentence of two to two and a half years’ imprisonment for the criminal conspiracy charge would be manifestly excessive because of the following three reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Such a high sentence was unsupported by precedents.

</div> A sentence near the upper end of the sentencing range should be reserved for only the worst cases within that prohibition and the offences committed by the offenders were not of that severity.

He concluded that neither of these factors was the sole, or even possibly the main, determinant of the sentence that should be imposed, and that all that could be gathered from the cases was that where items valued at more than $100,000 were stolen, sentences ranging from six months’ imprisonment to two years’ imprisonment had been imposed.

</div> It argued that the District Judge was wrong to have concluded that that there was no transnational element simply because the offenders were only aware of the conspiracy after they met Huang in Singapore and because the acts of theft took place only in Singapore. The Prosecution submitted that the crucial point was instead that the offenders had agreed to participate in a criminal activity that did not <span class="font-italic">only</span> involve persons in Singapore, in that they must have known after they were briefed by Huang that they were dealing with a “cross-border criminal enterprise” as Xiao Fu had contacted them in China.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Mr Tan and Ms Chong argued, on the other hand, that the District Judge was correct to have found that there was no transnational element because it was clear from the SOF that the offenders had known about the plan from Huang only after they arrived in Singapore. Counsel emphasised that there was no suggestion from the SOF that the offenders knew from the outset while they were in China that they would be coming to Singapore to commit theft. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, in the context of this case, the more pertinent question and the focus of the enquiry should not be whether there was a transnational element but whether the offenders, who were foreigners, had targeted Singapore for criminal activities. In this regard, I agreed with the District Judge that there was no evidence that showed that the offenders had known about the conspiracy or contemplated any illegal conduct before they arrived in Singapore. In fact, the SOF (in particular paragraphs 5 and 6) reflected otherwise. Given that there was at least some doubt in relation to this point, the District Judge was correct to have resolved the ambiguity in favour of the offenders. But the fact remained that after their arrival in Singapore, the offenders chose to engage in the conspiracy with Huang for three weeks. It did not appear that they chose to stay in Singapore throughout that duration for any <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purpose other than to commit the acts of theft in the casinos. To put it simply, their continued presence in Singapore was to perpetrate the thefts, from which they obtained substantial gains. From that point in time when they agreed to help Huang, the offenders became part of the conspiracy, which involved Huang and Xiao Fu scouting for people in China who were heading to Singapore. To that extent, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences had a transnational element. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Seen in the full light of the factual context, while I accepted that there was no evidence showing that the offenders had targeted Singapore to commit offences <span class="font-italic">before </span>they left China, they had certainly targeted Singapore and the casinos from the time they knew about the conspiracy and for the duration that they remained here and carried out the conspiracy. It was also telling that the offenders had <span class="font-italic">returned</span> to Singapore barely ten days after departing to commit further offences using the same <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span>. While this was not the subject of any of the charges, the fact that they had made a second trip to Singapore to carry out a further round of criminal activities was indicative of their motives and intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the District Judge had erred in not according due weight to the transnational element in the offences and, more importantly, the fact that the offenders had targeted Singapore in committing the offences. These factors would have enhanced the need for general deterrence and warranted the imposition of a higher sentence for the criminal conspiracy charges (see the observations of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Fernando </span><span class="font-italic">Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [67] and <span class="font-italic">Fricker</span><span class="font-italic"> Oliver v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter </span>[2011] 1 SLR 84 at [2]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the public interest demands deterrent sentences for all criminal activities in the casinos </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I turn next to address another argument raised by the Prosecution – that a higher sentence was warranted because the public interest necessitated the deterrence of criminal activities in the casinos in Singapore.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Prosecution took the position that the importance of deterring criminal activities in the casinos in Singapore could not be over-stated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In support of this submission, the Prosecution cited the 2009 report of the Financial Action Task Force on <span class="font-italic">Vulnerabilities of Casinos and Gaming Sector </span>and excerpts from the parliamentary debates on the Casino Control (Amendment) Bill 2012 as well as two unreported District Court cases, namely, (a) my decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kipuyo Lemburis Israel </span>(DAC 22231 of 2010 and others, unreported) (“<span class="font-italic">Kipuyo</span>”); and (b) the decision of Chief District Judge (“CDJ”) Tan Siong Thye (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Loo Siew Wan </span>(DAC 8360 of 2010 and others, unreported) (“<span class="font-italic">Loo Siew Wan</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 While I agreed that <span class="font-italic">on the facts of this case</span>, the offenders’ conduct called for a deterrent sentence, I did not agree with the broad and sweeping submission by the Prosecution that the public interest demanded deterrent sentences for (all) criminal activities in the casinos. In my view, the sentencing approach had to be more nuanced. It was not appropriate to suggest that <span class="font-italic">all</span> manner of criminal activity warranted deterrent sentences as long as, and just because, it was committed in a casino. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 These observations had, in fact, already been observed in <span class="font-italic">Kipuyo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Loo Siew Wan</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Kipuyo</span>, which involved an offence of cheating that took place in a casino, I aligned my views with those of CDJ Tan in <span class="font-italic">Loo Siew Wan</span>, and made the following observations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7 … It would also not be entirely accurate to say that all casino cheats must be handed deterrent sentences regardless of the nature or gravity of their offences. <span class="font-italic">The courts’ sentencing </span><span class="font-italic">approach has to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the sentence is appropriate to the individual circumstances of each case.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 In [<span class="font-italic">Loo Siew Wan</span>], the Chief District Judge opined as follows in his oral judgment: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10 The court will impose tough deterrent sentences against organi[s]ed or syndicated crime, illegal money lending, using counterfeit casino chips, money laundering, and large-scale criminal activities that are often associated with casino. This tough approach will also be taken against foreign syndicates, gang or groups who seek to infiltrate and perpetuate their vices in our casinos. This tough approach is necessary in order to curb crime and ensure that we continue to have safety and security. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 However, this same approach should not be applied across the board, and against all casino-related crimes. In a situation where it does not involve organi[s]ed or syndicated crime that has no effect on law and order issues, then the court should calibrate the sentence carefully according to the facts and merit of each case. There should not be a one size fits all [approach] in sentencing as this may lead to injustice. The sentence must fit the crime and the offender. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9 I concur fully with these observations. There may be good reasons why general deterrence for certain cheating offences can be a weighty consideration in sentencing. <span class="font-italic">Nevertheless, the mere fact that cheating takes place in casino does not ipso facto warrant a deterrent sentence, without more. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] <span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It cannot be gainsaid that the nature and gravity of the offending conduct and the offender’s culpability must always be carefully considered in calibrating the appropriate sentence. In the light of the elements of organisation, planning and premeditation as well as the duration of the offences in the present case, I agreed that the Prosecution’s call for a deterrent sentence was justified in this case. It must, however, be made clear that there is no <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>rule that casinos deserve special protection from criminal activities through the imposition of deterrent sentences across the board for any and all forms of crimes committed in, or related to, casinos.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence for the criminal conspiracy charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having considered the factors in this case, I was of the view that the sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment imposed by the District Judge for the criminal conspiracy charge was manifestly inadequate. There were several significant aggravating factors. The offences were not only planned and premeditated, but were numerous and repeated and had spanned three weeks. A substantial sum of $100,225 was stolen in total from more than 60 victims over 284 occasions. It was even more aggravating that the offenders had brazenly returned to Singapore less than two weeks later in order to commit further offences in the casinos. General and specific deterrence were clearly warranted. I also agreed with the Prosecution that it must be borne in mind that while only a single charge of criminal conspiracy to commit theft was brought, the offenders had in fact committed and attempted to commit nearly 300 acts of theft in total. This, together with the other aggravating factors, clearly placed this case at the higher end of the sentencing range for the offence of theft <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On the contrary, there were no significant mitigating factors other than the fact that the offenders had pleaded guilty. Yet, even their pleas of guilt must be considered in the light of the fact that they were caught red-handed when they tried to enter the MBS Casino with pieces of tape and that there was surveillance footage that captured each and every one of their acts of theft in the two casinos. In these circumstances, I could not agree with the District Judge that their pleas of guilt were a “highly significant mitigating factor”. With respect, the District Judge had accorded undue weight to their pleas of guilt in his calibration of the sentences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I should also add that I did not see any merit in the submission of the offenders that their sentences ought to be reduced as their culpability was lower than that of Huang, who was the mastermind. Taken at its highest, this argument led only to the conclusion that the sentence that ought to be imposed on Huang—if and when she was arrested—had to be <span class="font-italic">higher </span>than that imposed on the offenders because of the principle of parity. It did not follow from this argument that the sentences imposed on the offenders ought to be lower than those meted out by the District Judge or those submitted by the Prosecution. This was especially so given that both sets of sentences were lower than the maximum imprisonment term of three years for the offence of theft <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I also did not find the precedents raised by Mr Tan and Ms Chong, namely, <span class="font-italic">Zuniga</span>, <span class="font-italic">Gary Wu</span> or <span class="font-italic">Chia </span><span class="font-italic">Khee Har</span>, to be relevant or helpful. No grounds were delivered for any of the decisions. As reiterated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Janardana</span><span class="font-italic"> Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1288 (at [13(b)]), sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little, if any, weight because they are unreasoned, making it difficult if not impossible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge in coming to a certain decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Further, each of these decisions was also easily distinguished from the present case. For one, these cases involved far fewer numbers of thefts (two acts of theft with five other charges of cheating taken into consideration in <span class="font-italic">Zuniga</span>, two acts of theft with two other charges of theft taken into consideration in <span class="font-italic">Gary Wu</span>, and a single act of theft and a related customs charge in <span class="font-italic">Chia </span><span class="font-italic">Khee Har</span>). In contrast, the present case involved a conspiracy that resulted in nearly 300 acts of theft. A brief summary of the facts of each of the cases would be sufficient to show that they were very different from the present case. The offender in <span class="font-italic">Zuniga </span>had stolen clutch bags together with several accomplices. While the contents of the bag in one of the charges included gemstones worth S$251,275.50, it was not clear on the facts whether the offender and her accomplices knew of the existence of the gemstones <span class="font-italic">before</span> they stole the bag. The offender in <span class="font-italic">Gary Wu </span>had stolen paintings and a vase worth S$595,000 and S$50,000 respectively from his mother, and the items were all recovered. His mother, who was the victim, had pleaded for him to be given a lighter sentence. As for <span class="font-italic">Chia </span><span class="font-italic">Khee Har</span>, the offender had stolen 1,860 cartons of brandy valued at S$781,200 together with three accomplices, by removing the cartons from a wharf, and thereafter sold the brandy to a third party. In the light of the very different factual matrices and the absence of grounds for the decisions, I did not find these precedents relevant or helpful.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the above reasons, and in particular in the light of the significant aggravating factors and paucity of mitigating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment that was meted out by the District Judge was manifestly inadequate. A deterrent sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment, which would be at the higher end of the sentencing range for the offence of theft <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>was warranted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the two sentences should run consecutively</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I agree that in many instances, an offence under the CDSA would form a separate and distinct act of criminality from its predicate offence, be it theft as in this case or otherwise. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Soon v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1195, the High Court observed (at [34]) that the charges under the CDSA where the appellant had routed benefits of his crime out of Singapore using an offshore bank account were a sophisticated act of crime that reflected a separate act of criminality from the cheating charge that he had also been found guilty of. The predicate offence and the offence under the CDSA would usually concern the protection of different interests. As submitted by the Prosecution, the interest protected by the predicate offence would usually be the public interest in preventing and punishing the commission of the relevant illegal act, while the interest protected by the offence under the CDSA would usually be the public interest in making it as hard as possible for criminals to dispose of their ill-gotten gains.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the context of the present case, I agreed with the District Judge that the criminal conspiracy charge and the CDSA charge should be viewed as one transaction and the sentences for the two should thus run concurrently. As observed by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [40], while it may well be helpful to have regard to such factors as proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity (or diversity) of the protected interests in determining if the offences are part of a single transaction, in the final analysis, the determination as to whether the offences fall within the one transaction rule must be undertaken as a matter of common sense. In the present case, the offenders had only brought a total of S$1,000 and RMB6,800 (in the case of Zhou) and RMB4,500 (in the case of Luo) with them on their return trip to China. This was only a small fraction of their share of the stolen proceeds. They had gambled away or spent the remainder. As observed by the District Judge,

</div> it was entirely possible—and was in my view highly probable—that the offenders had removed the few thousand dollars out of jurisdiction simply because they were returning home and were taking whatever was left in their possession along with them. This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that the offenders brought a substantial portion of the monies that they had “removed” from Singapore <span class="font-italic">back into Singapore</span> on their second trip here on 24 October 2015. Zhou brought back S$1,000 and RMB2,040 while Luo brought back RMB2,400.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Looking at the circumstances as a whole, I was of the view that the District Judge was correct to have run the sentences concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the reasons above, I allowed the Prosecution’s appeals to the extent of enhancing the sentences for the criminal conspiracy charges to 24 months’ imprisonment. The appeals filed by Luo and Zhou were correspondingly dismissed. The sentence for the criminal conspiracy charge was to run concurrently with that for the CDSA charge in the case of each offender, resulting in a total of 24 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">See Kee Oon <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chong Yi Mei (Law Society of Singapore) for the appellant in MA 9093/2016/01 and the respondent in MA 9093/2016/02;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Justin Tan (Trident Law Corporation) for the appellant in MA 9094/2016/01 and the respondent in MA 9094/2016/02;  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joshua Lai and Alexander Woon (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in 9093/2016/01 and 9094/2016/01 and the appellant in 9093/2016/02 and 9094/2016/02.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
