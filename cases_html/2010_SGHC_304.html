<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the defendants, Glory
                    Wealth Shipping Pte Ltd (“GWS”), against the decision of Assistant
                    Registrar Peh Aik Hin (the “AR”) dismissing their application made
                    under ss 31(2) and 31(4) of the International Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)(the “IAA”) to set aside an Order
                    of Court dated 6 April 2010. That order gave the plaintiffs, Galsworthy
                    Limited of the Republic of Liberia (“Galsworthy”), leave to
                    enforce an arbitral award in Singapore. I dismissed the appeal and now give my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By a time charter dated 7 May 2008 (the
                    “Head Charter”), GWS chartered a vessel “JIN TONG”
                    (the “Vessel”) from Galsworthy for a period between 60 to 63
                    months and at a rate of US$35,500 per day. GWS in turn sub-chartered the Vessel
                    to Worldlink Shipping Limited (“Worldlink”) under a time charter
                    dated 11 July 2008 (the “Sub-Charter”) for a period between
                    14 to 16 months. Both charters were, however, not performed and this gave rise
                    to the disputes that were referred to separate London Arbitrations; <em>i.e</em>. between Galsworthy and GWS pursuant to the Head
                    Charter and between GWS and Worldlink pursuant to the Sub-Charter. The Tribunal
                    (“the Tribunal”) constituted to hear each arbitration comprised
                    the same set of arbitrators and although two final awards were issued by the
                    Tribunal, only one set of reasons was issued because the Tribunal was of the
                    view that many of the issues concerned were common to both
                arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Galsworthy’s claim against GWS in the
                    London Arbitration was for, <em>inter alia</em>, hire and
                    damages arising from GWS’s failure to perform the Head Charter, with
                    damages to be quantified by the difference between the charter party rate and
                    the market rate at or around the date of termination for the remaining
                    approximate charter period of four years and 10.5 months (17 December 2008
                    to 31 October 2013). The time charter and the dispute were governed by
                    English law. No oral hearing was conducted and the arbitration was determined
                    solely on written submissions. On 14 October 2009, the Tribunal issued the
                    final award (the “Final Award”) against GWS for the sum of
                    US$1,114,406.82 and US$39,393,745.03 for hire and damages respectively. These
                    figures were derived from the Tribunal’s finding that that the applicable
                    market rate for an equivalent fixture was US$11,000 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 23 December 2009, GWS applied to
                    challenge the Final Award pursuant to ss 68(2)(a) – (c) and 69 of the
                    Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (the “UK Act”) in the English
                    court. In so far as the s 68 grounds were concerned, counsel for GWS argued
                    that the Tribunal’s finding on the applicable market rate was wrong, and
                    as a result, the Tribunal failed to comply with its general duty in s 33
                    (see s 68(2)(a)). Further, that the Tribunal exceeded its powers (see
                    s 68(2)(b)), and finally, that the Tribunal did not conduct the proceedings
                    in accordance with the procedure agreed by the parties (see s 68(2)(c)). In
                    response to the application, Galsworthy applied on 26 January 2009 for
                    security for costs, and its application was granted on 15 March 2010. GWS
                    was ordered to provide £30,000 in security within eight days from the date
                    of the order, GWS did not do so and their application was thus dismissed on
                    25 March 2010. There was no hearing on the merits. In so far as the
                    s 69 grounds were concerned, GWS appealed against the Final Award on a
                    point of law. That appeal was dismissed on 16 February 2010. The English
                    High Court was of the view that the Tribunal’s decision was
                right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 6 April 2010, Galsworthy came to the
                    Singapore courts and obtained leave to enforce the Final Award. On 5 May
                    2010, GWS applied to set aside the order granting leave to enforce. The
                    application was heard on 23 June 2010 and dismissed by the AR on
                    2 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       GWS raised three grounds in the appeal before
                    me. First, it argued that the Final Award contained a decision on the matter
                    beyond the scope of the submissions to arbitration (see s 31(2)(d) of the
                    IAA). Second, the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of
                    the parties (see s 31(2)(e) of the IAA). Third, the enforcement of the
                    Final Award would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore (see
                    s 31(4)(b) of the IAA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the hearing before the AR below, a
                    preliminary dispute arose between the parties as to whether the defendant was
                    entitled to apply to set aside the order granting leave to enforce the
                    arbitration award since GWS had already made an application in the English
                    courts; <em>i.e</em>. a s 68 application under the UK
                    Act challenging the award on grounds of irregularity, and a s 69
                    application under the UK Act for an appeal on a point of law. As pointed out by
                    the parties, a party seeking to challenge an arbitration award has two courses
                    of action open to him; he can either apply to the supervising court to set aside
                    the award, or, he can apply to the enforcement court to set aside any leave
                    granted to the opposing party to enforce the award. These options were
                    alternatives and not cumulative. See <em>Newspeed International
                        Ltd v Citus Trading Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 1, which
                    was later cited with approval in <em>Aloe Vera American v Asianic
                        Food (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 174 (“<em>Aloe Vera</em>”). In the present case, GWS chose to
                    challenge the Final Award (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above) and
                    applied to set it aside before the supervising court. It was not disputed that
                    the grounds stated in the s 68 application were similar to those in this
                    appeal. That application before the English court was not heard because GWS did
                    not furnish security. The s 69 application was dismissed. The AR at the
                    hearing below was of the view that the GWS was still entitled to take up the
                    application to set aside the leave to enforce the award and he proceeded to hear
                    the application on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On this point, however, I was of the view that
                    GWS was not entitled to make this application since it had elected to proceed in
                    the English courts, and the application here to set aside the order granting
                    leave to enforce amounted to an abuse of process. Although Galsworthy did not
                    appeal against the AR’s findings on the preliminary dispute, I was
                    entitled to review that decision <em>de novo</em> and
                    furthermore during oral submissions, Galsworthy argued that this was an
                    additional ground to dismiss GWS’s appeal. GWS had the opportunity in
                    choosing either the supervisory or enforcement court to mount its challenge. It
                    elected to proceed on the former. As it turned out, Galsworthy successfully
                    applied and obtained an order for security for costs in the amount of
                    £30,000. Since security was not furnished, the s 68 application was
                    dismissed. Two affidavits were filed in support of its application here to set
                    aside the leave to enforce, but they did not explain why security was not
                    furnished in the English court. Counsel for Galsworthy pointed out that the
                    grounds relied on by GWS in the s 68 application in the English court were
                    exactly the same as those relied on by GWS in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I was therefore of the view that the GWS
                    application to set aside the order granting leave to enforce was a considered
                    decision on their part to avoid the need to furnish security to the English
                    court. This was not a case where the party resisting an award voluntarily
                    withdrew its appeal at the supervising court to mount a challenge at the
                    enforcement court. GWS had elected their forum of challenge and they ought to be
                    bound by it. GWS ought to have either furnished security as directed or appealed
                    against that order. It is the principle of comity of nations that requires our
                    courts to be slow to undermine the orders made by other courts unless
                    exceptional circumstances exist. None existed here. Furthermore, if the
                    application here was allowed, it could result in a duplication or conflict of
                    judicial orders. Obviously, if GWS’s s 68 application was heard on
                    the merits and failed, they would be entitled to challenge the enforcement of
                    the final award in the enforcement court if the grounds and standards between
                    the supervising and enforcement jurisdiction are different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the alternative, and assuming that GWS was
                    entitled to make an application to set aside the order granting leave to enforce
                    on the merits, I was not convinced that GWS had sufficiently established the
                    three grounds they asserted on appeal pursuant to ss 31(2) and 31(4) of the
                    IAA. In so far as the s 31(2) grounds are concerned, it is clear from the
                    express wording of the statutory provision that GWS, a party resisting the
                    enforcement of the foreign award, bore the burden of proving to this court that
                    the grounds they relied on had been proved. Both counsel agreed on this, but
                    they disagreed as to the standard applicable for such an application. Counsel
                    for GWS submitted that the enforcement of the Final Award is not automatic and
                    that a full hearing of the relevant issues before our courts ought to be
                    allowed. In support of this view, she cited Loh JC’s decision in <em>Strandore Invest A/C and others v Soh Kim Wat</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 151 (“<em>Strandore</em>”), which adopted the English Court of Appeal
                    decision in <em>Dallah Estate and Tourism Holding Company v
                        Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Government of Pakistan</em>
                    [2010] 2 WLR 805 (“<em>Dallah</em>”). In contrast, Galsworthy took the view that our
                    jurisdiction adopted a “mechanistic” attitude towards the
                    enforcement of these foreign awards and that our courts should not consider the
                    merits of the foreign award. Counsel for Galsworthy cited Prakash J’s
                    decision in <em>Aloe Vera</em> in support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The submissions implied that the decisions in
                        <em>Strandore</em> and <em>Aloe
                        Vera</em> were in conflict since the former seemed to have made some
                    reservations on the latter. However, the material portions of those decisions
                    actually concerned different issues and I did not see any conflict as a result.
                    The relevant portions of <em>Strandore</em> are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22     I now turn to the law. <em>Aloe Vera of America, Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and
                            another</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 174 (“<em>Aloe Vera</em>”) lays down the rule that the
                        enforcement of a foreign arbitration award under s 30 IAA and
                        O 69A r 6 RSC, is a mechanistic process. All the applicant
                        seeking enforcement has to do is to produce the arbitration agreement, prove
                        that the defendant was mentioned in the arbitration agreement exhibited by
                        the applicant, and that an Arbitral Tribunal had made a finding that the
                        defendant was a party to that agreement and that the Arbitral Tribunal had
                        made an award against him, exhibiting the duly authenticated original award
                        or a duly certified copy thereof. It does not require a judicial
                        investigation by the court enforcing the award under the IAA, the
                        examination that the court must make of the documents under O 69A
                        r 6 RSC is a formalistic and not substantive one. Section 31(1)
                        IAA supports this approach. This approach has also been endorsed recently
                            in<em>Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/s I Likvidation
                            (formerly known as Knud Hansen A/S) v Ultrapolis 300 Investments Ltd
                            (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 108, (“<em>DSK v Ultrapolis</em>”). A distinction is drawn between
                        the first stage under s 30 and the second stage under s 31.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23     With great respect to two very experienced
                        judges, I have my reservations, especially on <em>Aloe
                            Vera</em>, and how far the approach that is advocated is
                        consistent with other cases, including the recent English Court of Appeal
                        decision in <em>Dallah Estate and Tourism Holding
                            Company v The Ministry of Religious Affairs, Government of
                            Pakistan</em> [2009] EWCA Civ 755,
                            (“<em>Dallah Estate</em>”). The judge
                        at first instance stated that when a party is challenging the jurisdiction
                        of an arbitral tribunal under s 103(2) of the English Arbitration Act
                        1996, (which is the equivalent of our s 31(2) IAA), and that party is,
                        by the very words of that section, required to “prove” a
                        matter, that must mean prove the existence of the relevant matters on a
                        balance of probabilities. That exercise is, to that extent, a rehearing, not
                        a review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As correctly pointed out by both counsel and the AR below, there are
                    two stages regarding enforcement proceedings; the first stage of enforcement
                    pertains to the initial grant of leave to enforce, and the second stage of
                    enforcement whereby a party to whom an award was made against resists the
                    enforcement based on the grounds set out in the IAA. The reference in <em>Aloe Vera</em> to a “mechanistic process”
                    referred to the first stage and not the second stage. With regard to the second
                    stage, it is clear from the express wording of s 31(2) that a party ought
                    to prove the grounds relied on a balance of probabilities, as was held in
                        <em>Strandore</em>. The comments made in <em>Strandore</em> endorsed the above bifurcated analysis, and
                    standards required in each stage ought not to be conflated with each other. I
                    agree. The law concerning the two-stage process was the same before and after
                        <em>Strandore</em>. The standards submitted by counsel
                    for GWS and Galsworthy were both correct but they were examining different
                    provisions. In so far as this appeal was concerned, both sides acknowledged that
                    the enquiry involved the second stage of the enforcement proceedings, and it
                    cannot be disputed that GWS bore the burden of proving the grounds in
                    s 31(2) it relied on, on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Three related grounds were raised, but all
                    without basis. Under the first ground, GWS submitted that the award contained a
                    decision on the matter beyond the scope of the submissions to arbitration. The
                    principal complaint was that the Tribunal was presented with evidence by
                    Galsworthy in the arbitration that there was no market existing for the Vessel
                    at the date of the termination of the Head Charter. Counsel for GWS argued that
                    the Tribunal acknowledged the absence of a market in its Reasons for the Award
                    (at [28] to [29] of the Tribunal’s decision), it nevertheless proceeded to
                    find that the applicable market rate was US$11,000 daily. GWS argued that
                    Galsworthy had the burden of proving damages, and since the normal measure of
                    recovery in cases of premature termination of a charterparty is the difference
                    between the contractual rate for the balance of the charter period and the
                    market rate, Galsworthy’s failure to establish a market and market rate
                    was naturally fatal to its claim for damages. GWS was thus compelled to claim
                    that the Tribunal’s decision was based on facts or arguments not presented
                    by or discussed by parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In response, counsel for Galsworthy argued
                    that one of the issues to be determined by the Tribunal was the amount of
                    damages to be awarded and it was GWS (and affirmed by the Tribunal subsequently)
                    that submitted that the market rate of US$12,000 on a daily basis be used in the
                    event that the Tribunal was to hold that Galsworthy was entitled to damages.
                    Galsworthy made the observation that GWS was attempting to re-litigate the
                    issues in dispute and were asking the Singapore court to determine the merits of
                    the Final Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In my view, the essence of GWS’s
                    complaint was the Tribunal’s eventual finding on the market rate of the
                    charter for the purposes of quantifying the damages. The issue of damages was
                    submitted to the Tribunal for a decision which it duly made. It was GWS
                    themselves who asked for damages to be assessed according to a figure of
                    US$12,000 in the event that they were liable. I therefore found no basis in
                    their complaint. In counsel’s closing submissions for GWS to the Tribunal,
                    it was submitted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    
              <em>Further or alternatively, if
                                (which is denied) it is held that Owners are entitled to
                                damages</em>, Charterers submit that Owners’ damages
                            should be assessed in accordance with a market rate of US$12,000. In
                            this regard, Charterers refer to the supplementary report of Lewis
                            Chartering Limited (Bundles pages 438 – 441) which concludes that
                            if Owners had taken action earlier in November 2008 when the Vessel was
                            first rejected, it would have been possible to secure a fixture at a
                            higher rate than that which Owners obtained when the Vessel was only
                            refixed in January 2009. Accordingly, Owners have failed to properly
                            mitigate their loss in waiting until December 2009 to offer the Vessel
                            for fixture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, since GWS had already addressed this issue before the
                    Tribunal, they cannot now say that the eventual decision was outside the scope
                    of the parties’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second ground raised by GWS was that the
                    arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. This
                    argument was similar to the first point, GWS argued that the finding made by the
                    Tribunal was based on evidence erroneously transposed from the Sub-Charter
                    arbitration onto the Head Charter arbitration. The Tribunal relied on a
                    supplementary report prepared by Worldlink’s expert in the Sub-Charter
                    arbitration pertaining to the market rate to be used to calculate the
                    appropriate damages. GWS also argued that the supplementary report was confined
                    solely to the issue of mitigation of damages, and that the Tribunal grossly
                    misinterpreted and wrongly accepted that report as evidence from GWS of the
                    market rate. Galsworthy’s case was that GWS had agreed for the Head
                    Charter Arbitration and Sub-Charter Arbitration to be heard concurrently, and
                    that led to the Tribunal issuing an order for a concurrent hearing of the two
                    arbitrations. Furthermore, it was GWS themselves who had consistently adopted
                    the submissions and evidence of the sub-charterer Worldlink, and this practice
                    was expressly extended to the expert evidence from Worldlink. In my view
                    therefore, there was no substance in GWS’ complaint since GWS themselves
                    requested for the reference they now complain about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     GWS also took the alternative position on
                    appeal that this US$12,000 submission ought to be confined to its submission
                    that Galsworthy had failed to mitigate its losses. I found this argument to be
                    also without basis because GWS’ submission (as set out in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) clearly referred to it as damages and
                    not mitigation. The only reason GWS could make this argument on appeal was that
                    they consolidated their arguments on the quantification of damages and the
                    failure to mitigate in a single paragraph. In any event, the issues of
                    assessment of damages and the duty to mitigate were inextricably linked, and GWS
                    could not argue one and not the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Third, counsel for GWS argued that the
                    enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore.
                    This ground was based on s 31(4) of the IAA but the substance of this
                    ground was identical to those raised in the preceding two grounds; namely that
                    the Tribunal failed to decide the matter in accordance with the facts and
                    evidence presented by the parties, and additionally, that the Tribunal
                    erroneously transposed the evidence used in the Sub-Charter arbitration. As I
                    have held above, those contentions made by GWS were without basis and it was
                    unnecessary for me to consider the consequential issue of whether these
                    contentions met the high threshold required under s 31(4). Even if I were
                    to assume that GWS’s complaints had the necessary evidential basis, I did
                    not find that those complaints offended any notion of justice and morality (see
                        <em>Hebei Export Corp v Polytek Engineering Co Ltd</em>
                    [1999] 2 HKC 205), or amounted to exceptional circumstances to justify
                    a refusal of enforcement (see <em>Re An Arbitration Between
                        Hainan Machinery Import and Export Corp and Donald &amp; McArthy Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 354 at [45]). As I saw it,
                    GWS’s unhappiness was with the amount of damages awarded by the Tribunal,
                    and not their liability arising from the failed charter. GWS had the opportunity
                    to, and did address the Tribunal on the appropriate quantification of damages
                    and the Tribunal had taken their submissions into account. Even if I had
                    accepted that there was no existing market to determine the market rate, the
                    Tribunal could not be faulted for attempting to find the best evidence on record
                    to determine the market rate to be used in the quantification of damages. In my
                    view therefore, GWS’s unhappiness with the Tribunal’s decision,
                    without more, was not a sufficient basis to prevent an application for the
                    enforcement of the Foreign Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On account of the above, I dismissed
                    GWS’s appeal and ordered costs fixed at $2,000 with reasonable
                    disbursements to be awarded to Galsworthy.</p>
