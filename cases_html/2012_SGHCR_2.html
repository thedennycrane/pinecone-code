<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by Aksa Far East Pte Ltd
                    (“the defendant”) for a stay of Suit 105 of 2010 (“the
                    Suit”) pursuant to section 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap
                    143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”), pending the arbitration of the
                    issues in the Suit between the parties, in accordance with an arbitration
                    agreement contained in the contract which the parties entered
                into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It raises the interesting issue of whether a
                    suit, which appears to involve a claim by one party for <em>a
                        debt</em> arising from a foreign judgment, should be stayed pursuant
                    to s 6 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual matrix</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties entered into a contract on or around
                    18 December 2003 (“the contract”) for the sale and purchase of two
                    generator sets. On or around 27 December 2003, the parties also signed a
                    confirmation agreement acknowledging the sale and purchase of the generator
                    sets. The contract, which was drafted in Chinese, contained an arbitration
                    agreement (“the arbitration agreement”). It was not disputed that
                    the arbitration agreement read as follows when translated to English:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this contract
                        during performance shall be resolved by two parties through friendly
                        consultation. The dispute or controversy, which cannot be resolved by two
                        parties through consultation, shall be submitted to relevant departments for
                        final arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd
                    (“the plaintiff”) alleged that the defendant breached the terms of
                    the contract by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     failing and or omitting to supply to
                        the plaintiff generator sets which were brand new;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     failing and or omitting to supply to
                        the plaintiff generator sets that originated from England;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     supplying to the
                        plaintiff generator sets that were incapable of use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Arising from the breaches, the plaintiff
                    commenced proceedings (“the PRC claim”) against the defendant and
                    Shanghai Yates Genset Co Ltd (“Shanghai Yates”), which was also a
                    party to the contract as a guarantor, in the Suzhou Intermediate Court
                    (“the PRC court”), Jiangsu Province, in the People’s
                    Republic of China (“PRC”). It was not disputed by the defendant
                    that the plaintiff had served the papers relating to the PRC claim on the
                    defendant at its registered address in Singapore. However, the defendant chose
                    not to participate in the proceedings before the PRC court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The PRC court subsequently granted judgment in
                    favour of the plaintiff (“the PRC judgment”) and made the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The contract between the plaintiff
                        and the defendant be rescinded;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff to return the generator sets to the
                        defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        defendant to refund the contract price of US$190,000 to the
                        plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        defendant to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of RMB7,088 within a
                        month after the PRC judgment came into effect; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     Other claims of the plaintiff,
                            <em>ie</em>, for other losses, were
                        rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was not disputed that the PRC judgment was
                    served on the defendant in Singapore. The defendant did not pursue an appeal
                    against the PRC judgment and the dateline for the defendant to do so expired on
                    25 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 23 July 2011, the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors sent a letter of demand to the defendant to demand for payment of the
                    PRC judgement sums and the requisite interest. The defendant rejected this
                    demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 10 February 2012, the plaintiff commenced the
                    Suit in the Singapore High Court. On 29 February 2012, the defendant took out an
                    application to stay the Suit pursuant to section 6 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant submitted that this was a
                    straightforward application because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     there is an arbitration agreement in
                        the contract where it is clear that parties intended to arbitrate in the
                        event of a dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     despite the clear intention to arbitrate, the plaintiff has breached
                        the agreement by taking out an action in the Singapore courts;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Singapore
                        court can and should grant a mandatory stay of the Suit as the prerequisites
                        under s 6 of the IAA are met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Before me, the defendant argued that the fact
                    that the plaintiff had obtained a PRC judgment was irrelevant to this
                    application. It was further submitted that the plaintiff had pleaded both the
                    contract and the PRC judgment in their statement of claim, and so if the Suit is
                    allowed to proceed, this court would have to determine the substantive dispute
                    between the parties and whether the Chinese court has international jurisdiction
                    over the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff argued that the
                    defendant’s application was misconceived and therefore should be
                    dismissed. The Suit involves a claim by the plaintiff for a debt arising from
                    the PRC judgment and not a claim to enforce its rights under the contract
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It was further contended that s 6 of the IAA
                    is inapplicable here as there are no live disputes between the parties, since
                    the PRC court has already adjudicated upon, and disposed of the matter with
                    finality. The defendant has not adduced any evidence or made any assertion that
                    the PRC judgment was not made by a court of competent jurisdiction, or that it
                    was not final and conclusive, or was in any way irregular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Further and/or in the alternative, the
                    plaintiff submitted that the arbitration agreement is null and void,
                    inoperative, or incapable of being performed. It was argued that PRC law should
                    govern the agreement to arbitrate since it was also the law which governed the
                    contract. The plaintiff adduced a legal opinion from a PRC counsel to show that
                    the arbitration agreement in the contract is invalid under the laws of the
                    PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The main issue in this application is whether
                    the Suit, which appears to involve a claim by the plaintiff for <em>a debt</em> arising from the PRC judgment, should be stayed
                    pursuant to s 6 of the IAA. In the circumstances, it is appropriate to begin by
                    setting out the applicable law, before applying that to the factual matrix at
                    hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Suit should be stayed pursuant to s 6 of the
                IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Sections 6(1) and (2) of the IAA provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6.</b> -(1) Notwithstanding Article 8 of the
                        Model Law, where any party to an arbitration agreement to which this Act
                        applies institutes any proceedings in any court against any other party to
                        the agreement <b>in respect of any matter which is the
                            subject of the agreement</b>, any party to the agreement may, at
                        any time after appearance and before delivering any pleading or taking any
                        other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings
                        so far as the proceedings relate to that matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The court to which an application has been made in
                            accordance with subsection (1) shall make an order, upon such terms or
                            conditions as it may think fit, staying the proceedings so far as the
                            proceedings relate to the matter, unless it is satisfied that the
                            arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of
                            being performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is instructive to refer to <em>Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (“<em>Tjong Very
                    Sumito</em>”), where the Court of Appeal discussed the operation of
                    s 6 of the IAA at [22] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22     Section 6 of the IAA acknowledges the
                        primacy of the specific arbitration agreement in question. In order to
                        obtain a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration under s 6, the party
                        applying for a stay ("the applicant") must first show that he is party to an
                        arbitration agreement, and that the proceedings instituted involve a "matter
                        which is the subject of the [arbitration] agreement". In other words,
                            <b><em>the applicant has to show that the
                            </em></b><b>proceedings instituted fall within the
                            terms of the arbitration agreement</b>. If the applicant can show
                        that there is an applicable arbitration agreement, then the court <em>must</em> grant a stay of proceedings unless the party
                        resisting the stay can show that one of the statutory grounds for refusing a
                        stay exists, <em>ie</em>, that the arbitration
                        agreement is "<em>null and void, inoperative or incapable of
                            being performed</em>".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is clear from the above that the onus is on
                    the defendant here to show that the Suit instituted by the plaintiff falls
                    within the terms of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the law to the factual matrix</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The arbitration agreement in the contract
                    between the parties provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any <em>dispute or controversy arising out of or relating
                            to this contract during performance</em> shall be resolved by two
                        parties through friendly consultation. The dispute or controversy, which
                        cannot be resolved by two parties through consultation, shall be submitted
                        to relevant departments for final arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On a plain reading of the arbitration agreement, it appears <em>prima facie</em> that it only applies to disputes or
                    controversies arising <em>during</em> performance of the
                    contract. In this regard, it is important to determine what exactly the
                    defendant is seeking to stay in this application. In other words, is the
                    defendant seeking a stay of the dispute and/or controversy arising out of or
                    relating to the contract during performance, or is it seeking a stay of the
                    plaintiff’s claim for a debt arising from the PRC judgment? The answer to
                    this question would necessarily depend on the characterisation of the
                    plaintiff’s claim in the Suit, to which I now turn my attention
                to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the hearing before me, the defendant argued
                    that the plaintiff had pleaded both the contract and the PRC judgment in its
                    statement of claim (“SOC”). Accordingly, if the Suit is allowed to
                    proceed, this court would have to determine the substantive dispute arising out
                    of the contract between the parties and also whether the PRC court has
                    international jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant also submitted that the terms of
                    the arbitration agreement cover the Suit instituted by the plaintiff. The
                    defendant highlighted that the plaintiff had claimed in its SOC that the
                    defendant had breached the terms of the contract and so the plaintiff is
                    entitled to the sums of money ordered in the PRC judgment. Therefore, the
                    plaintiff’s claim clearly arises out of or relates to the contract, as
                    provided in the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With respect, I cannot agree with the
                    defendant’s arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     First, a plain reading of the SOC clearly
                    shows that the references to the contract and the circumstances under which the
                    parties entered into the contract were stated so as to provide the necessary
                    background to the plaintiff’s claim for a debt arising from the PRC
                    judgment against the defendant in Singapore. Moreover, the fact that the
                    plaintiff’s claim is for a debt arising from the PRC judgment against the
                    defendant in Singapore is also made clear in [17] of the SOC:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Accordingly, it follows that what the
                    defendant is seeking to stay in this application is the plaintiff’s claim
                    for a <em>debt</em> arising from the PRC judgment,
                        <em>and not</em> a claim which concerns any dispute or
                    controversy arising out of or relating to the contract between the parties
                    during performance, as provided in the arbitration agreement. Hence, it is clear
                    that the Suit instituted by the plaintiff, <em>ie</em>, to
                    claim for a debt arising from the PRC judgment from the defendant in Singapore,
                    does not fall within the terms of the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, I also note that the defendant does
                    not dispute that it was duly served with the PRC court papers before the PRC
                    proceedings took place, and also the PRC judgment after the PRC proceedings
                    ended. The defendant made the conscious decision of neither objecting to the
                    proceedings at the PRC court nor appealing against the PRC judgment when it was
                    subsequently granted. It was also not argued that the PRC judgment was either
                    not made by a court of competent jurisdiction or that it was in any way
                    irregular. In the circumstances, there can be no question that the PRC judgment
                    stands as a final and conclusive judgment. The plaintiff is therefore entitled
                    to institute the Suit in order to claim the debt arising from the PRC judgment
                    from the defendant in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In light of the above, I find that the
                    defendant has not been able to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the
                    Suit instituted by the plaintiff falls within the terms of the arbitration
                    agreement contained in the contract between the parties (see <em>Tjong Very Sumito</em> at [22]). Accordingly, the defendant’s application to stay
                    the Suit pursuant to s 6 of the IAA cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I note that the defendant had argued in the
                    second affidavit filed by one Yong Yit Yeng Mavis dated
                        5<sup>th</sup> April 2012, in support of its stay
                    application, at [21] that she was
                    advised “… that under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign
                    Judgments Act [(Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed)], other than by way of registration of the
                    judgment, no proceedings for the recovery of a sum payable under a foreign
                    judgment shall be entertained by the Singapore courts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The difficulty with this argument is that the
                    plaintiff is not seeking to register the PRC judgment in Singapore. Instead, as
                    noted above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>, what the plaintiff is seeking to do is
                    to claim a debt arising from the PRC judgment against the defendant in
                    Singapore. That the plaintiff is able to do so was noted by Belinda Ang J in
                        <em>Bellezza Club Japan Co Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko and
                        others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 342 at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Foreign judgments <em>in personam</em> may be
                        enforced by a claim in proceedings in Singapore if the foreign judgment is a
                        money judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the judgment
                        pronounced by the foreign court is final and conclusive as between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, in light of my finding at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above that the defendant’s application
                    to stay the Suit pursuant to s 6 of the IAA cannot succeed, it is not necessary
                    for me to examine the issues of whether the arbitration agreement is null and
                    void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed, and whether Singapore or PRC
                    law should govern the arbitration agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the
                    defendant’s application to stay this action pursuant to s 6 of the
                    IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
