<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involved the determination of
                    ancillary matters pursuant to an interim judgment of divorce pronounced by the
                    Family Court. It was transferred to the High Court as the matrimonial assets
                    were declared to exceed $1.5m in value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The matter was heard before me on
                    14 January 2011. As I was not satisfied with the defendant wife’s
                    (“the Wife’s”) disclosure of her assets and financial
                    position, I directed her counsel to clarify certain issues which I had raised
                    and meanwhile reserved judgment. The Wife subsequently filed an affidavit to
                    clarify some of those issues. This was followed by a response affidavit from the
                    plaintiff husband (“the Husband”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I gave judgment on 2 June 2011 and made the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     No order as to custody or care and
                        control of the parties’ daughter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     The matrimonial assets (valued at $4m in total)
                        would be apportioned 60:40 in favour of the Husband. To achieve this
                        apportionment, the matrimonial home would be sold and $1m of the ensuing
                        sale proceeds would be paid to the Wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     No order for the payment of any sum to the Wife
                        as maintenance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Husband was to pay $123,877.77, as he proposed, to the Wife as
                        maintenance for the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Wife has filed an
                    appeal against these orders and I now give the grounds for my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This was a 25 year marriage and there were two
                    children borne of this union. The parties registered their marriage on
                    28 March 1982. They had a son (“the Son”) in 1989 and a
                    daughter (“the Daughter”) in 1990. The Husband is a lawyer who, at
                    the time of these proceedings, was employed as the Director/Secretary of the
                    Board of Legal Education and drew a monthly salary of $13,500. The Wife was a
                    nurse who rose through the ranks - from staff nurse, to nursing officer and
                    eventually to Director of Nursing (at Thomson Medical centre). As Director of
                    Nursing, she was drawing a monthly salary of about $7,500.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, she left this position around May
                        2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and became an entrepreneur, setting up
                    two infant–care related businesses with a friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In mid 2002, 20 years into their marriage, the
                    couple ceased physical intimacy and the Husband decided to sleep apart from the
                    Wife in a separate room in the matrimonial home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In January 2005, the Husband moved out
                    of the matrimonial home. The Husband filed a writ for divorce in January 2007 on
                    the ground that he had lived separately and apart from the Wife for a continuous
                    period of four years since 2002. The Wife counterclaimed that the Husband had
                    improperly associated with other women and she could not reasonably be expected
                    to live with him. The Husband elected not to contest this and the Family Court
                    granted an interim judgment of divorce on 30 October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Both parties proceeded to file a series of
                    affidavits in the lead up to the ancillary matters hearing. When the parties
                    came before me in January 2011, the Husband was 61 years old and the Wife was 58
                    years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The ancillary matters pertained to the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The custody and care and control of
                        the children;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The division of matrimonial assets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The maintenance of the Wife and the
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody and care and control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Husband stated that the parties had agreed
                    earlier at a mediation session that both he and the Wife would have joint
                    custody of both children, with the Husband having care and control of the Son
                    and the Wife having care and control of the Daughter. Each of the parties would
                    have reasonable access to the child not in his or her care and
                        control.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was also the Wife’s proposal
                    in her first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“Wife’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> AOAM”) filed on 22 January 2008.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It appeared from the affidavits that the Son had
                    been living with the Husband until around July 2009 to February 2010, when the
                    Son returned to live in the matrimonial home as he was posted to a fire station
                    nearby for his National Service.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Daughter,
                    on the other hand, had been living in the matrimonial home with the
                        Wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I was
                    heartened to note that the parties had come to an arrangement which allowed each
                    other liberal access to the child not living with them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In their submissions tendered to me, both
                    parties acknowledged that this issue of custody, care and control was no longer
                    relevant to the Son as he had reached majority by virtue of turning 21 in May
                    2010. I agreed with the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     While the Wife continued to seek care and
                    control of the Daughter (which presumably was in the context of the joint
                    custody order agreed during the mediation session (see above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>)), the Husband submitted at the hearing before
                    me that this would be an appropriate case for the court to make no order on this
                        issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> I agreed with the
                    Husband’s submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In <em>CX v CY (minor: custody
                        and access)</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690, the Court of Appeal
                    considered the virtues of a “no custody order” over a
                    “joint custody order”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Whether the judge erred in granting joint custody to
                            the parties instead of sole custody to the mother</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18     As a preliminary point, we noted that both
                        parties did not take issue with the judge's variation of the district
                        judge's "no custody order" to that of a "joint custody order". We should
                        make it clear from the outset that a "no custody order" is not tantamount to
                        depriving both parents of custody. <em>It is generally
                            accepted that the practical effects of a "no custody order" and a "joint
                            custody order" are similar where a "care and control order" has been
                            made. In the normal course of events, the parents of a child will have
                            joint custody over him</em>. We thus agree with Prof Leong Wai
                        Kum's comments in <em>Principles of Family Law in
                            Singapore</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at pp 538–539 that
                        the making of a "no custody order" should be seen as leaving the law on
                        parenthood to govern the matter, as both parents continue to exercise joint
                        custody over the child. <em>Such an order also affirms the
                            approach of the courts not to intervene unnecessarily in the
                            parent–child relationship where there is no actual dispute between
                            the parents over any serious matters relating to the child's
                            upbringing</em> (see <em>Re Aliya Aziz
                            Tayabali</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 894   and
                            <em>Re G (guardianship of an infant)</em> [2004]
                        1 SLR(R) 229   ("<em>Re
                        G</em>")).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19     Since the practical effects of a "no
                        custody order" and "joint custody order" are similar, the more important
                        question to address is: Under what circumstances should a "no custody order"
                        be preferred over a "joint custody order"? <em>As mentioned
                            earlier, where there is no actual dispute between the parents over any
                            serious matters relating to the child's upbringing, it may be better to
                            leave matters at status quo, and not to make any custody
                            order</em>. As was suggested by Assoc Prof Debbie Ong in her
                        article <em>"</em>Making No Custody Order: <em>Re G (Guardianship of an Infant)</em>" [2003] SJLS 583 at
                        p 587–588, <em>in other circumstances where there is a
                            need to prevent parties from drawing the child into the battle over the
                            extent of their custodial powers, or where there is a need to avoid any
                            possibly negative psychological effect that comes about when one parent
                            "wins" and the other parent "loses" in a custody suit, it may also be
                            appropriate not to make any custody order</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The existing arrangement between the parties,
                    which the Husband appeared to find acceptable, already saw the younger child
                    residing with the Wife. I did not think there was any actual dispute between the
                    parents over any matter of weight relating to the Daughter’s upbringing.
                    Also, in my view, there was no need to risk the possibly negative psychological
                    effect that might come about if the Wife had “won” and the Husband
                    had “lost” the custody suit as far as care and control of the
                    Daughter was concerned. Therefore, I made no order as to custody and care and
                    control. In any case, I noted that the Daughter would have reached majority
                    shortly as she turned 21 on 19 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The starting point for the division of
                    matrimonial assets is found in s 112(1) of the Women's Charter
                    (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) while
                    s 112(2) provides a list of factors to be considered by the court when
                    exercising its wide powers of discretion under s 112(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In <em>NK v NL</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743, the Court of Appeal held that there are two
                    distinct methodologies when it comes to the division of matrimonial assets. The
                    first is the “global assessment methodology” and the second is the
                    “classification methodology” (see [31] to [33]). As I saw
                    no need for the separate apportionment of different classes of matrimonial
                    assets in this case, I opted for the “global assessment
                    methodology”. In my view, this would achieve a just and equitable
                    apportionment with minimal reshuffling of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I will now proceed to divide the matrimonial
                    assets in four steps:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Determining and valuing the pool of
                        matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Considering the direct contributions of the
                    parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Considering the indirect contributions of the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     Deciding on a just and equitable
                        apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making orders to achieve this
                        most conveniently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 1: Determining and valuing the pool of matrimonial
                assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The operative date at which the matrimonial assets are
                determined</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A preliminary issue which arose was the
                    question of the operative date at which the matrimonial assets are to be
                    determined or identified. The Court of Appeal has provided guidance on this
                    issue in its recent decision of <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo
                        Nancy and another appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157
                        (“<em>Nancy Tay</em>”). Having
                    comprehensively considered the positions in other common law jurisdictions
                    regarding the said operative date, the Court of Appeal observed (at [31]) that there was no uniformity of approach
                    among the various jurisdictions and that there was “no one single formula
                    or test which is adopted generally.” It went on to hold at [32] that the operative date is to be
                    determined at the court’s discretion, having taken into account all the
                    circumstances:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32     It seems to us that Parliament has very
                        aptly recognised that it would not be wise to lay down a fixed date for the
                        purposes of determining what assets would fall within the pool of
                        matrimonial assets and what would not. A fixed cut–off date may not
                        necessarily secure a just result in every case. <em>The
                            simple truth is that the circumstances under which an asset could be
                            acquired by a spouse are so varied that it would be best to leave it to
                            the court to determine where the line should be drawn after taking into
                            account all the circumstances</em>. It may be useful to illustrate
                        the problems through several examples.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At [39], the Court of Appeal presented the four possible options
                    which courts could adopt as the operative date for the determination of what
                    constitutes the pool of matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The date of
                    separation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        date on which the petition of divorce is filed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     The date on which a decree <em>nisi</em> (<em>viz</em>. an interim judgment
                        of divorce) is granted; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The date of hearing of ancillary matters (including the
                        date of the hearing of an appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, the Court of
                    Appeal went on to state in that same paragraph:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of the four possible cut–off dates, <em>it seems to
                            us that generally speaking it would be sensible to apply either the date
                            of the decree nisi or the date of the hearing of the ancillary
                            matters</em>. Much would depend on the
                        fact–situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Court of Appeal went on to affirm (at
                        [40]) the trial judge’s
                    adoption of the date on which the decree <em>nisi</em> was
                    granted as the operative date. The Court of Appeal appeared to be influenced by
                    the lapse of “some four long years” between the date of the decree
                        <em>nisi</em> and the determination of ancillary
                    matters. It was concerned that “[t]he spouse undertaking any new
                    investment should be made to bear the consequences of his or her
                    act...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the interim judgment of
                    divorce was granted on 30 October 2007 and the hearing of the ancillary
                    matters took place more than three years later, on 14 January 2011. I took
                    the view that it was sensible in the factual circumstances of this case to apply
                    the date of the interim judgment of divorce as the operative date for the
                    determination of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The date at which matrimonial assets are to be valued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Having established the operative date for the
                    determination of the matrimonial assets, the next step for the court is to
                    determine the date on which the matrimonial assets should be valued. Generally
                    speaking, not all matrimonial assets should be valued on the same date.
                    Matrimonial assets can broadly be divided into two categories: first, jointly
                    owned assets; and second, separately owned assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In most cases (such as the present), where the
                    parties are the registered joint owners of the matrimonial home, the matrimonial
                    home would be the quintessential jointly owned matrimonial asset. Other jointly
                    owned assets might include joint investments in shares or other immovable
                    property. Separately owned assets, on the other hand, are held in the sole name
                    of one party. They might be the parties’ own immovable property, personal
                    bank accounts or investment accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As a general principle, jointly owned assets
                    should be valued at the date of the judgment on ancillary matters, see Chan Seng
                    Onn J’s (“Chan J’s”) statements in <em>AJR v AJS</em> [2010] 4 SLR 617 at [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both parties ought to have the benefit of any appreciation and similarly,
                        suffer any depreciation in the value of the asset up to the date of this
                        judgement <em>since the parties themselves have implicitly
                            agreed to keep the matrimonial asset to the present date</em>
                        pending the conclusion of the ancillary hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should clarify that in making those statements, Chan J referred
                    to matrimonial assets generally. However, I think that he could not have meant
                    for those statements to apply to separately owned assets, over which one party
                    had sole control. This is because in that situation, it cannot be said that both
                    parties implicitly agreed to keep such matrimonial assets pending the conclusion
                    of the ancillary hearing. Indeed, a party might not even be aware of certain
                    assets separately owned by the other party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Although <em>obiter</em>,
                    I think that jointly owned assets which can be disposed of or otherwise dealt
                    with by either of the parties unilaterally should also come under the category
                    of jointly owned assets. An example is a joint share trading account owned
                    jointly by the parties, but which either party is allowed to transact without
                    further authorisation from the other party. If a husband takes a view on the
                    market and sells certain shares from the joint trading account, using the sale
                    proceeds to buy other shares for the same account, the wife would have no
                    problem monitoring the husband’s trading activity. If so, she should be
                    taken to implicitly agree with his management of the joint trading account,
                    unless or course she explicitly states otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On the other hand, separately owned
                    matrimonial assets should generally be valued at the date on which the
                    matrimonial assets were determined. In <em>AJR v AJS</em>
                    at [4], Chan J said, in the context of
                    explaining why any asset acquired after the date of interim judgment should not
                    be considered a matrimonial asset to be distributed between the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The party choosing to invest in new assets after the date of the Interim
                        Judgment takes the benefit of an appreciation and also the market risk of a
                        fall in the value of those investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Insofar as <em>AJR v AJS</em> can be read as
                    authority for the proposition that the date of interim judgment is invariably
                    the operative date at which the matrimonial assets are to be determined, it is
                    clear that from <em>Nancy Tay</em> that this is not the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The authorities reviewed above also support
                    the proposition that separately owned matrimonial assets should generally be
                    valued at the date on which the matrimonial assets were determined. Not only
                    should a party not be exposed to the risk of a gain or a loss flowing from the
                    other party’s <em>separate acquisition</em> of new
                    assets (funded out of existing matrimonial assets), a party should also not be
                    exposed to the risk of a gain or a loss flowing from the other party’s
                        <em>continued holding</em> of the existing matrimonial
                    assets which he or she separately owns in the first place. Indeed, to hold an
                    asset is as much an investment decision as to sell it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The corollary to the general principle of
                    limiting risk exposure to the party taking a unilateral decision on a separately
                    owned asset is that it also prevents the other party from benefiting from a
                    profitable investment decision which he or she had no part in; see <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 729 at [23]
                        (“<em>Samuel Ong</em>”) where the Court
                    of Appeal held that having disassociated herself with a certain property
                    investment by the husband, the wife could not reap its profits:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In our view, the Wife cannot now claim what she once rejected. If the
                        Wife maintains that she has nothing to do with the liabilities associated
                        with Malvern Springs, then she similarly can have no share in its
                        profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal determined that the property was not to be
                    included in the matrimonial asset pool for division (at [15]). In light of <em>Nancy
                        Tay</em>, <em>Samuel Ong</em> can also be
                    understood as having fixed the operative date for determining whether the
                    “Malvern Springs” property specifically was a matrimonial asset,
                    at a date before it was acquired in the husband’s sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For completeness, I am of the view that a
                    party should not need to expressly disassociate itself from a particular asset
                    so as to avoid the risk of a gain or loss flowing from it. In <em>Samuel Ong</em>, the Wife’s explicit disassociation from a
                    particular property was particularly relevant as the parties had at one point in
                    time intended for the property to replace their matrimonial home (see <em>Samuel Ong</em> at [5]). Her explicit dissociation thus put to rest any dispute over
                    whether that property was jointly or separately owned (see <em>Samuel Ong</em> at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I emphasise that the above dates for valuation
                    should only be applied generally as the starting points for consideration. One
                    can foresee situations in which it might be inequitable to adhere to the
                    aforesaid dates. For example, in the case of a wealthy tycoon husband with
                    massive investments under his sole name and a homemaker wife with no investments
                    under her sole name, the husband might suffer immense losses due to a bad
                    economy (through no fault on his own) between the date of interim judgment and
                    the date on which the division of matrimonial assets is ordered. In that event,
                    it would probably be inequitable to order the husband to pay over to his wife
                    her share of the matrimonial assets based on a valuation made before the economy
                    took a dive. Ultimately, the date on which matrimonial assets should be valued
                    is up to the court’s discretion, just as it is when it comes to the
                    operative date on which the pool of matrimonial assets should be determined.
                    What is critical is to arrive at a “just and equitable division”
                    (see <em>Nancy Tay</em> at [36]) in all the circumstances in each particular
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having expressed my views on this issue, I
                    note that in <em>Nancy Tay</em>, the Court of Appeal stated
                    at the end of [39], which discussed at
                    length a suitable cut–off date for the determination of matrimonial
                    assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Once an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided,
                        then for the purposes of determining its value, it must be assessed
                            <em>as at the date of the
                        hearing</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the true context in which that statement was made shows that
                    the Court of Appeal did not intend to cast in stone the date of valuation of
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     First, there was no discussion on the
                    justification for fixing the date of valuation invariably at the date of the
                    ancillary matters hearing. Secondly, as I have already noted at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, the Court of Appeal’s emphasis
                    was clearly on a “just and equitable division” (at [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative date or dates may not
                        really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable
                        division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Keeping that statement in mind, <em>Nancy
                        Tay</em> affords some flexibility in selecting valuation dates for
                    matrimonial assets insofar as they enable the court to arrive at a just and
                    equitable division in all the circumstances of the case before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In a few situations, where there are
                    protracted hearings or judgment has been reserved and material changes take
                    place in the value of assets in the meanwhile, I have no doubt that the court is
                    entitled to be updated where it would otherwise cause an injustice or prevent a
                    just and equitable division of assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Having considered the applicable principles on
                    the operative dates for determining and valuing the matrimonial assets, I will
                    proceed to apply them to the present facts. At this stage, I need to candidly
                    state that I came to my views on the said operative dates only after I had the
                    benefit of time to consider them subsequent to my oral judgment given on 2 June
                    2011. On the present application of these views, which I have had the additional
                    time to consider, I arrived at a slightly different total valuation of the
                    matrimonial assets. In giving my oral judgment earlier, I arrived at a total
                    valuation of the matrimonial assets slightly below $4m and thus rounded it up to
                    $4m. On the application of my distilled views, the total value I arrive at is
                    only slightly above $4m. I have rounded that figure down to $4m and therefore,
                    happily, my original orders on division stand unchanged.</p>

                    assets (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above), the Husband’s
                    contention did not straightforwardly fail. In <em>Nancy
                        Tay</em>, the Court of Appeal held that different operative dates
                    might apply for different assets, depending on the circumstances surrounding
                    their acquisition (at [36] and [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36     ... However, the problem is in determining
                        what that operative date should be, bearing in mind the possible diverse
                        assets, and the different circumstances under which they were acquired.
                            <em>Indeed, it does not follow that there can only be one
                            operative date. Multiple dates are distinctly possible, depending on the

                            acquisition</em>. Ultimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative
                        date or dates may not really be that critical as compared to arriving at a
                        just and equitable division.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39     ... Of the four possible cut–off

                        Much would depend on the fact–situation. <em>As
                            indicated at </em>[36] <em>, there is nothing to preclude the
                            court from applying different cut–off dates to different

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, I decided that the same operative
                    date should apply for the Malaysian Property. First, I noted that when the
                    Husband bought the Malaysian Property, he was still living under the same roof
                    as the Wife. Secondly and perhaps more pertinently, there appeared to be no real
                    practical difference anyway and it would be neater to have one operative date
                    for all the matrimonial assets. Adopting the date of interim judgment as the
                    operative for the determination of matrimonial assets, I valued the Malaysian
                    Property at the date of interim judgment since it was a matrimonial asset
                    separately held by the Husband. The closest valuation I had to the date of
                    interim judgment was RM 331,309<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, as stated in the
                    Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means filed on 10 January 2008
                    (“the Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup>
                    AOAM”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Pausing now to consider the position if I had
                    determined that an earlier operative date applied for the Malaysian Property
                    specifically (so that it was not a matrimonial asset): it must be noted that the
                    funds which the Husband used to buy the Malaysian Property would then have had
                    to be restored to the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>Nancy
                        Tay</em> at [33]). As the
                    Husband did not state how much he paid to purchase the Malaysian Property in the
                    first place, I would have approximated that figure by the earliest valuation of
                    the Malaysian Property available to me, which was the same figure of RM
                        331,309.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As the Husband did not propose an exchange
                    rate, I adopted the Wife’s proposed exchange rate at RM2.40 per
                        SGD.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the Malaysian Property was valued
                    at $138,045.42. I thus included the Malaysian Property (valued at $138,045.42)
                    into the pool of matrimonial assets. In making my orders to divide the
                    matrimonial assets between the parties to achieve the apportionment between them
                    which I deemed fair, I took into consideration the Husband’s intention for
                    the Malaysian Property to be his retirement home.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Motor vehicles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Husband purchased a Toyota Corolla (Altis)
                    SFW6284R in July 2005. It was valued at $36,000 on 31 December 2007, the
                    valuation dated closest to the date of interim judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Husband
                    submitted that this was not used for the purposes of the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I included this vehicle and valuation
                    into the pool of matrimonial assets for much the same reasons as those for the
                    Malaysian Property (see above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Insurance policies<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(a)   Great Eastern policies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Husband’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> AOAM stated that he had five Great Eastern
                    insurance policies which had surrender values I totalled at $292,589. Some of
                    these policies were subsequently surrendered and the proceeds reinvested into
                    managed funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I pause to note at this juncture the
                    difficulties engendered by setting in stone the rule that assets must be valued
                    at the date of the ancillary matters hearing (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>). Those policies which were surrendered simply did not
                    exist at the date of the ancillary matters hearing. The next best option would
                    have been to approximate their value by taking the value of the managed funds as
                    at the date of the hearing. However, in my view, it would not have been fair to
                    expose the Wife to the risk of gain or loss which the Husband unilaterally took
                    in reinvesting the surrendered policies into certain managed funds which he
                    picked. Therefore, it seemed most fair to simply value all the Great Eastern
                    insurance policies as closely to the date of interim judgment as
                    possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(b)   AIA and Prudential policies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Husband had two AIA insurance policies. As
                    the first listed the Daughter as its beneficiary (and did not state a surrender
                    value), I considered this the Daughter’s asset and did not include it in
                    the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. As for the second, the Husband did
                    not provide a surrender value but its coverage was stated to be $42,000 in the
                    Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> I took this
                    figure to approximate its surrender value and included it in the pool of
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Husband had one Prudential policy which
                    listed the Son as its beneficiary (and did not state a surrender value), as with
                    the first AIA policy, I considered this to be the Son’s asset and did not
                    include it in the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(c)   NTUC Policies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Husband had two savings/investments NTUC
                    policies which had cash values I totalled at $166,671.52. These were included
                    into the pool of matrimonial assets. He had two further health insurance
                    policies which I understood from the insurance provider’s website,
                    &lt;http://www.income.com.sg&gt; (accessed 13 May 2011), not to have a surrender
                    value. They appeared to cover medical expenses and provide cash payouts in the
                    event of severe disability. On that basis, I did not consider them assets to be
                    included in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Shares and unit trusts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Husband’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> AOAM stated that he had shares which values I
                    totalled at $68,021.02.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> It also stated that he had unit trust
                    investments which values I totalled at $310,156.14.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Some of those unit
                    trust investments were made in United Kingdom pounds (“GBP”). As
                    neither party proposed an exchange rate for these investments, I applied the
                    exchange rate of SGD2.81 per GBP, which I obtained from
                    &lt;http://sg.finance.yahoo.com&gt; as the exchange rate for the week of 7
                    January 2008, which was in the same week as the day on which the Husband’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> AOAM was sworn and filed (<em>ie</em> 10 January 2008). Therefore, I counted the Husband’s
                    investments, in shares and unit trusts valued as above, towards the pool of
                    matrimonial assets.</p>

                        1<sup>st</sup> AOAM stated that he had Singapore bank
                    accounts holding monies which I totalled at $75,772.79. He also had Malaysian
                    bank accounts which held monies I totalled at $18,850.60; and other foreign bank
                    accounts (denominated in GBP, Australian dollars (“AUD”) and US
                    dollars (“USD”)) which held monies I totalled at $11,349.65.
                    Again, as the Wife was the only party who proposed exchange rates,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I adopted her exchange rates at $1.30 per AUD
                    and $1.29 per USD. I included these monies as valued in the pool of matrimonial
                    assets.</p>

                    Membership valued at $6,000. I also included this in the pool of matrimonial

                    monies which were matrimonial assets held solely by her as they were most likely
                    accumulated before the date of interim judgment (because she left her salaried
                    position as Director of Nursing in May 2007). The CPF monies used to fund the
                    purchase of this vehicle are accounted for below as I counted her CPF monies
                    standing to her account (as at the date of interim judgment) towards the pool of
                    matrimonial assets.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Therefore, I valued the pool of matrimonial
                    assets at $4,007,299.44. I rounded this down to $4m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 2: Considering the direct financial contributions of the
                parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The matrimonial home was bought at around
                    $550,000 (since it was undisputed that the 10% initial cash deposit was
                        $55,000).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The Husband claimed that the
                    ratio of his direct financial contributions vis–à–vis the
                    Wife’s was around 84:16 (counting the financial contributions he claimed
                    to have made to the renovation, furniture and fitting as well). Against that,
                    the Wife claimed that the ratio was somewhat more to her favour at 73:27
                    (Husband:Wife). The difference pertained to disputes over whether the Wife had
                    contributed towards the initial $55,000 cash deposit towards the property, a
                    capital loan reduction payment of $105,000 made in 1997, as well as the
                    renovation, furniture and fittings which were valued at around
                        $100,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 3: Considering the indirect contributions of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indirect financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Husband contended that he had provided for
                    most of the family’s financial needs and the upkeep of the matrimonial
                    home. This allowed the Wife to keep most of her income to herself. The Husband
                    also said he provided the Wife an allowance when she was in between jobs with
                    Mount Elizabeth Hospital and National University Hospital.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Further, he stated that he had loaned
                    $30,000 to the Wife which assisted in the purchase of a car for her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The Wife said that
                    the car was a family car and suggested that the $30,000 was to make up the
                    difference for the higher priced car which the Husband (but not the Wife, who
                    wanted a smaller car) wanted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Husband
                    countered that there was already a family car but the Wife wanted a smaller car
                    for her own use. However, he accepted that the second car was used occasionally
                    for the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Wife contended that in “the early
                    years”, she supported the family financially as the Husband was serving
                    his pupillage and not earning much. Her monthly salary paid their rent back
                    then. She also claimed to have paid more than $1,000 for groceries and household
                    items “on a regular basis”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> To this, the
                    Husband said that he was gainfully employed by then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> As
                    for the Husband’s contention that the Wife kept most of her income to
                    herself, the Wife denied this, stating that she had used around 70% of her then
                    $5,000 “take home pay” for the family until the Husband started
                    contributing to household expenses in 2001. Instead, it was the Wife’s
                    financial contributions which allowed the Husband to amass his investments and
                    properties. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Wife stated that she paid for outings to
                    local attractions, cinema shows, musicals and meals for the children. She also
                    paid for clothing (including uniforms), and reading material (including
                    textbooks and enrichment material) for the children. In addition, she paid for
                    the Husband’s clothes. She said she gave the children festive gifts and
                    Chinese New Year “angpows”. She also stated that she paid for the
                    children’s medical bills and bought computers for the family’s
                    general leisure and education. She asserted that her financial contributions
                    made “over the years” were
                        “substantial”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Husband generally contested the
                    Wife’s claims but conceded that she had made financial contributions
                    occasionally. He stated that as the head of the household, he had provided for
                    most of the family’s expenses. In particular, he pointed out that the Wife
                    had not accounted for the children’s “angpows” which she
                    said she had saved for their future.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Wife responded
                    with a bare denial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indirect non–financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Husband said that up to the time he
                    decided to sleep separately from the Wife in mid 2002, he had fulfilled his
                    duties and obligations as a reasonable husband. His strong support as a husband
                    enabled the Wife to secure a well paying job and career advancement. He had
                    similarly been a dutiful and responsible father, even after he left the
                    matrimonial home. He had continued to provide for most of the upkeep of the
                    matrimonial home after he left. Also, the Son had been residing with him until
                    the Son began National Service, when the Son moved back to the matrimonial home
                    for convenience. Although he was firm with the children, the Husband said he had
                    no problems or difficulties communicating with them. On the other hand, the Wife
                    needed his assistance to resolve her disputes with the children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Husband further stated that even if the
                    Wife’s assertions that he had improper associations with women were true,
                    it did not necessarily mean that he had failed in his responsibilities as a
                    husband or father. He had tried his best and would continue doing his part. He
                    did not contest the Wife’s assertions as an acrimonious divorce would not
                    be to the children’s interests.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Wife denied that the Husband was a good
                    husband and father. At home, he would watch television while drinking beer
                    instead of spending time with the children or being concerned for their studies.
                    It was his irresponsible extra–marital affair that led to the
                    family’s break up. The Son confided in her that he was unhappy staying
                    with the Husband as he hardly spoke to the Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Wife contended that she was the sole
                    caregiver to the children when they were sick, nursing them back to health with
                    her occupational skills. The Husband left almost everything to her. She was the
                    one who took the children to the zoo and other places of interests, coached them
                    in their studies and shepherded them in times of transition. She maintained a
                    clean home and garden. She prepared meals and supervised the maid’s
                    household chores and cooking.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     She inspired the Husband by counseling and
                    encouraging him to maximize his potential, supporting him and comforting him
                    through his frustrations when times were bad. She took care of his health and
                    prepared meals for him. Looking back, she was proud of her contributions to her
                    children and the Husband which were “indisputably
                        immeasurable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Husband disputed the Wife’s claims
                    generally, stating that she had been engrossed and busy with her work and
                    further studies which allowed her promotion to Director of Nursing. She was not
                    the sole caregiver of the children when they were ill since the maid and the
                    Husband had to help when she was at work. As for the Wife being an inspiration
                    to him, the Husband said she was temperamental and suspicious. She frequently
                    nagged at him and the children and habitually humiliated and put him down in
                    front of her parents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>

                            is also on achieving a fair and reasonable division (see <em>Halsbury's Laws of Singapore</em> at paras 130.760
                            and 130.761). All this is undoubtedly not only consistent with the
                            existing case law but is also both logical and commonsensical. But there
                            is no substitute for a careful consideration of all the relevant facts

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The division of matrimonial assets is a subject to be approached with

                            rather than a purely rigid or mathematical formula. All relevant
                            circumstances should be assessed objectively and holistically. Generally
                            speaking, however, when a marriage ends a wife is entitled to an
                            equitable share of the assets she has helped to acquire directly or

                    can only do my best since neither party applied for the other to be
                    cross–examined. I am comforted that the law merely requires a broad brush
                    approach to achieve a just and equitable division, as the Court of Appeal stated
                    in <em>Nancy Tay</em> (at [78]):</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     At the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife
                    candidly conceded that the Husband has made more direct and indirect financial
                    contributions to the family than the Wife. As for indirect non–financial
                    contributions to the family, I noted that the Wife herself stated on affidavit
                    that she kept a “busy schedule”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> She rose to become a
                    nursing director which her counsel described as the “highest nursing
                        post”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Husband does not seem to be the
                    irresponsible father which the Wife has made him out to be. His
                        4<sup>th</sup> AOAM filed on 10 May 2010 exhibited a
                    utilities bill in the sum of $333.02 for the matrimonial home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> This was addressed to the Husband and
                    dated 18 January 2010, long after the interim judgment of divorce had been
                    given. Also, he produced multiple Automated Teller Machine funds transfer
                    receipts which showed that he had transferred amounts between $50 and $777.77 to
                    the Son’s and Daughter’s bank accounts over the course of 2009 to
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Copies of
                    the Son’s and Daughter’s bank passbooks confirmed their bank account
                    numbers. While the receipts did not show that transfers were made to both
                    accounts every month, some months saw multiple transfers of funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Above this, the Husband exhibited one card
                    from each of his children. The Daughter’s card read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">dear daddy,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">happy x’mas &amp; HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I [heart] you everyday. be safe and have a terrific trip to
                        M’sia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">thanks for being a great, supportive person throughout. I am honoured to

<p class="Judg-1">The Son’s card appeared to only have one line and read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A son will always belong to his father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Son then signed his name and added the words “Love
                    you”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Although indirect non–financial
                    contributions are difficult to measure in financial terms (see <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> at [39]), I am aware of the importance of “giving the
                        <em>fullest</em> effect to the non–financial
                    contributions” [original emphasis] of the parties (<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> at [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Taking a general view on the evidence, I do
                    not think that this is one of the cases in which a wife more than makes up for
                    her lesser direct and indirect financial contributions to the family <em>via</em> her indirect non–financial contributions to
                    the same. In fact, I am not entirely convinced that the Wife even made up for
                    the same through her indirect non–financial contributions. The Husband
                    appeared to have made his fair share of indirect non–financial
                    contributions to the family. Therefore, I would apportion a greater proportion
                    of the matrimonial assets to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In exercising my discretion on determining a
                    just and equitable apportionment of the matrimonial assets between the parties,
                    I also had regard to s 112(2)(f) of the Charter (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)  any period of rent–free occupation or other benefit
                        enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the
                        other party;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no indication from the evidence that the Wife paid the
                    Husband any rent since he moved out. In fact, as I noted at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above, it appears that the Husband has been
                    paying the utilities bills for the matrimonial home even after he moved
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As stated above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, during the
                    hearing, I had specifically asked counsel for the Wife to tell his client to
                    address the Husband’s queries regarding the surrender values of her
                    insurance policies. I also specifically asked him to tell her that I might draw
                    an adverse inference against her if she did not do so. Her unelaborated answer
                    that she could not obtain the surrender values as the policies had not matured
                    was unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     At the hearing, Counsel for the Husband had
                    also challenged the Wife’s assertion that she had no income from her
                    company, BabyBreeze.Biz, after she left her salaried position as Director of
                    Nursing. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Counsel for
                    the Husband additionally submitted that the Wife had refused to disclose whether
                    she was receiving director’s fees from her businesses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> He noted that the Wife’s tax
                    filings indicated that she had not been drawing an income from her two
                    businesses, namely Babybreeze.Biz Pte Ltd and BabyBreeze Confinement
                        Nanny.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> However, he drew
                    my attention to the Wife’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit filed
                    on 30 July 2010, which was a response to a further discovery request from the
                    Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At page 10 of that affidavit, the Wife exhibited the
                    “Trading and Profit &amp; Loss Account” of Babybreeze.Biz Pte Ltd.
                    The sum of $139,678.61 was booked under the line item “Salaries (Casual
                    Labour)”. I asked Counsel for the Wife to ask his client to clarify who
                    was drawing those salaries. I stated specifically to the Wife’s counsel
                    that I wanted to be fair to her and did not want to come away thinking that she
                    was hiding anything when she was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     However, the Wife’s
                        6<sup>th</sup> affidavit (filed after the hearing before me)
                    did not satisfactorily address the issue which I raised. Regarding salaries, she
                    simply stated that she had a staff member who was paid “$14,152.00 salary
                    and $1,249.50 CPF contribution.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Given the small scale of the business,
                    I assumed that those figures referred to an annual salary. This left the bulk of
                    the $139,678.61 figure unexplained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It is clear that the parties have duties to
                    make full and frank disclosure to the court. In <em>BG v
                        BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233, the Court of Appeal held (at
                        [52])</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52     First, the general duty that every party

                        relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets. <em>The position in law is that full and frank disclosure is

                            first approach is for the court, pursuant to the adverse inference, to
                            go on to determine the value of the undeclared asset</em>. In
                            <em>Tay Sin Tor v Tan Chay Eng</em> [2000]
                        2 SLR 225 , Kan Ting Chiu J at [18] held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An adverse inference was drawn against the husband that he has not
                            disclosed all his assets. The District Judge should not stop after
                            drawing the inference and should have gone on to determine the value of
                            the undeclared assets. This cannot be done with precision because it
                            springs from a lack of information, but nevertheless, a value should be
                            inferred from the information available and it is for the party who is
                            dissatisfied with it to show that it is unreasonable. This has to be
                            done so that a value for the undisclosed assets can be included in the
                            division. As matters stand, it is not known how much unaccounted assets
                            the husband was deemed to have, and how that influenced the eventual
                            decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    
                        <em>The other approach to giving effect to the adverse
                            inference drawn against a spouse is to order a higher proportion of the
                            known assets to be given to the other spouse</em>. In <em>NK v NL</em>, there was no explanation proffered by the
                        husband as to what happened to the particular amount in question (a
                        considerable sum of $2.7 million) warranting an adverse inference against
                        him. In the circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it was more just
                        and equitable (and practical) to order a higher proportion of the known
                        assets to be given to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Here, I adopted the latter approach of
                    ordering a higher proportion of the known assets (than I would have otherwise
                    ordered) to be given to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     For reasons including those stated above and
                    adopting the broad–brush approach, I came to the view that apportioning
                    60% ($2.4m) of the matrimonial assets to the Husband and 40% ($1.6m) to the Wife
                    would achieve a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. In
                    deciding on this amount, I also took into account the order as to the
                    maintenance of the Wife which I proposed to make.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     As the Wife already held assets amounting to
                    approximately $600,000 on her own, I ordered that the matrimonial home be sold
                    and $1m of the sale proceeds be transferred to her. For the avoidance of doubt,
                    I stated that the sum of $235,538.84 which she contributed to the purchase of
                    the matrimonial home from her CPF monies was to be included in this sum of
                    $1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In deciding on maintenance for the Wife, I had
                    regard to the factors set out s 114 of the Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Wife has estimated her monthly
                    expenditures at around $8,470.00.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> After deducting the line items
                    exclusively relating to the daughter (polytechnic monthly fees: $175; allowance,
                    food and transport: $500), the Wife’s monthly expenditures total $7,795.
                    Para 32 of the Wife’s Written Submissions stated that it would be
                    reasonable to estimate the Wife’s “income capacity” at
                    between $4,000 and $5,000. She sought a monthly maintenance sum of $2,500 as
                    maintenance for her and the Daughter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> While she asked to be paid maintenance so that
                    she could live in a condominium apartment so as to maintain her standard of
                        living,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> I noted that the Husband had
                    himself “downgraded” to a rented Housing and Development Board
                    flat since moving out of the matrimonial home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> Notwithstanding his monthly
                    salary of $13,500, the Husband is 61 years of age this year and diagnosed with
                    diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Taking the entire circumstances of this case
                    into account; and as I consider what I have apportioned to the Wife in terms of
                    the matrimonial assets to be generous in the circumstances, I make no order for
                    the payment of any sum to her as maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The power of the court to order maintenance
                    for children pursuant to a divorce is found in s 127 of the Charter.
                    However, the relevant factors for consideration are found at s 69(4) of the
                    Charter. As the Son has reached 21 years of age, s 69(5)(b) and (c) of the
                    Charter are also relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     As stated above at <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>, the Wife sought a monthly maintenance sum of $2,500 as
                    maintenance for herself and the Daughter. The Husband proposed that 15% of the
                    net sale proceeds from the matrimonial home (after deducting refunds to the
                    parties’ CPF accounts and sales charges), amounting to $123,887.77, should
                    be paid as maintenance for the children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> At the
                    hearing, his counsel informed me that the Son was presently serving National
                    Service and intended to pursue tertiary studies. The Daughter would turn 21 soon
                    and was in her first year of polytechnic studies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Pursuant to the provisions of the Charter
                    which I highlighted above and taking into account all the circumstances of this
                    case, I ordered that the sum of $123,877.77, as proposed by the Husband, be paid
                    to the Wife as maintenance for the children. The Husband can pay this out of the
                    remaining sale proceeds of the matrimonial home and/or by liquidating some of
                    his investments. These funds being maintenance for the children, the Wife should
                    set them aside for their education.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Having heard counsel, I made no order as to
                    costs. I gave parties liberty to apply.</p>
