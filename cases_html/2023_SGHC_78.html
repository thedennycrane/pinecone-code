670”) are applications in HC/OS 22/2022 (“OS 22”) and HC/OS 21/2022 (“OS 21”) respectively, brought by the Attorney-General (the “AG”), for orders of committal against Mr Ravi s/o Madasamy (“Mr Ravi”), an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. The applications concern Mr Ravi’s conduct in two sets of proceedings in November 2021.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In SUM 670, the AG alleges that Mr Ravi committed contempt of court during the hearing of SC-904600-2020, being the State Court proceedings of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Magendran Muniandy </span>(“SC 904600”). As for SUM 669, it arises out of Mr Ravi’s conduct in HC/S 699/2021, being the High Court proceedings of <span class="font-italic">Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Qwong Meng v SBS Transit Ltd</span> (“S 699”). At the time, Mr Ravi was practising at the law firm of M/s K K Cheng Law LLC (“K K Cheng LLC”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Pursuant to the request of Mr Ravi, the applications are dealt with together. This is because a defence common to both applications is that Mr Ravi was suffering from a relapse of his bipolar disorder. Also, as agreed by the parties, the issue of liability is to be determined first, with submissions on punishment to be furnished thereafter, should Mr Ravi be found liable for any of the allegations of contempt. This is, therefore, my judgment for both applications on the question of liability for contempt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Drawn from the transcripts of various court proceedings and contemporaneous communications, these background facts are largely undisputed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SC-904600-2020 (Public Prosecutor v Magendran Muniandy) </span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In SC 904600, the accused person, Mr Magendran Muniandy (“Mr Magendran”), claimed trial to certain criminal charges. The trial was fixed for hearing at 9.30am on 9, 10 and 11 November 2021 before District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt (“DJ Chay”). However, on 3 November 2021, Mr Magendran’s previous lawyer filed an application to discharge himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The discharge application was fixed for hearing at 9.15am on 8 November 2021 before DJ Chay. On that day, at 9.20am, Mr Ravi appeared on behalf of Mr Magendran. After Mr Magendran confirmed that he was appointing Mr Ravi as his new lawyer, DJ Chay granted the application by the previous lawyer to discharge himself.

This was “part of a considered policy choice to come out strongly in favour of upholding and protecting the integrity and standing of the Judiciary,” namely, it intended to pre-empt hair-splitting or fine distinctions as to the level of risk that had to be established in order to satisfy the test (<span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan v Attorney-General and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 804 (“<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span>”) at [36]). In the “risk” inquiry, the court is simply guided by the central question: “Is the risk one that the reasonable person coming across the contemptuous statement would think needs guarding against so as to avoid undermining public confidence in the administration of justice?” (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span> at [38]). In answering this question, both the <span class="font-italic">content </span>and <span class="font-italic">context </span>of the alleged contemptuous statement may be relevant (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA) </span>at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As for the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>, the contemnor must have intentionally published such material or committed such act. By s 3(2) of the AJPA, it is not necessary for the contemnor to have intended to scandalise the court. This is consistent with the common law position where there is no need for the contemnor to intend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice (<span class="font-italic">Au Wai Pang v Attorney-General </span>[2016] 1 SLR 992 at [24]–[31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I should add that by Explanation 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>to s 3(1) of the AJPA, “[f]air criticism of a court is not contempt by scandalising the court” within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA. To constitute fair criticism, the statement must (a) have some objective or rational basis; (b) be made in good faith and be respectful; and (c) generally be expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span> at [41] and <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 at [15]–[23]). Before the enactment of the AJPA, the Court of Appeal preferred the view that under the common law, the concept of fair criticism related to liability as opposed to being a separate defence to contempt (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [80]). This view has since been encapsulated in the AJPA. Therefore, the legal burden would fall on the AG to prove that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA) </span>at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 3(1)(d) of the AJPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Turning to contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA, the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>is the act of either insulting the judge or causing any interruption or obstruction to the judge while the judge is sitting in court proceedings. This limb concerns acts of contempt in the face of the court <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, ex facie </span>contempt, which disrupts the court process itself.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> is the intention to offer such insult or cause such interruption or obstruction. Further, s 3(6) of the AJPA provides that the contemnor is liable if he “knows or ought to have known that the act would prejudice or interfere with or obstruct or pose a <span class="font-italic">real risk</span> of prejudice to or interference with or obstruction of the course of the court proceeding [emphasis added].” Compared to scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), there is an additional <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement as to the effect of the act on the court proceeding. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 3(1)(e) of the AJPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Moving on, s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is a broad sweeping provision under the AJPA. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of contempt pursuant to s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is the commission of “any other act” that interferes with or obstructs the administration of justice or poses a <span class="font-italic">real risk</span> of the same. The <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> element<span class="font-italic"> </span>of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is the intention to commit such an act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Within s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), a form of the “real risk” test at common law is retained. As alluded to at [35] above, at common law, an act of scandalising contempt must “pose a real risk of <span class="font-italic">undermining public confidence in the administration of justice</span> [emphasis added]” (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]). Section 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), however, requires the act to “pose a real risk of <span class="font-italic">interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]”. This is, in my view, a slight legislative reformulation of the “real risk” test. Notwithstanding the difference, guidance as to the assessment of what constitutes a “real risk” remains instructive. As the Court of Appeal noted, the court must avoid either extreme on the legal spectrum, <span class="font-italic">viz, </span>of <span class="font-italic">either</span> finding that contempt has been established where there is only a remote or fanciful possibility that public confidence in the administration of justice is (or might be) undermined <span class="font-italic">or</span> finding that contempt has been established only in the most serious situations (as embodied in the “clear and present danger” test). In undertaking such an analysis, the court must not substitute its own subjective view for that of the average reasonable person, as the inquiry must necessarily be an objective one (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]). I adopt and adapt these guidelines in the inquiry within s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the question of the <span class="font-italic">real risk </span>of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Similar to s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), s 3(6) of the AJPA applies (see [38] above). Thus, there is a requirement for actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the contemnor that the act would prejudice or interfere with or obstruct or pose a real risk of prejudice to or interference with or obstruction of the course of the court proceeding. With these legal principles in mind, I deal with each of the 10 allegations made against Mr Ravi. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HC/SUM 670/2022  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First allegation: Intentionally providing false information on his availability to DJ Chay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In respect of the first allegation made under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the AJPA (see [23(a)] above), the AG has to show that:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi provided false information to DJ Chay concerning his availability for trial for SC 904600 for 9 to 11 November 2021, and that this posed a real risk of obstructing the administration of justice; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi did the act intentionally, and knew or ought to have known that his doing so posed a real risk of obstructing the administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In relation to the <span class="font-italic">actus reus, </span>the AG submits that when Mr Ravi informed DJ Chay that he was available for trial from 9 to 11 November 2021, he was already representing Mr Li for trial in SC 901420 on 8 to 10 November 2021. Therefore, Mr Ravi furnished <span class="font-italic">false </span>information to DJ Chay. This resulted in the “double-fixing” of trial dates which, the AG argues, posed a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice.  In relation to the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>, the AG argues that Mr Ravi must have been aware of his involvement in SC 901420 when he was addressing DJ Chay about his availability on 8 November 2021. Specifically, Mr Ravi was fixed to appear before PDJ Toh in SC 901420 (which had been fixed for trial on 8 to 10 November 2021) immediately after his hearing with DJ Chay. Furthermore, even during the hearing of SC 904600 on 8 November 2021, Mr Ravi mentioned to DJ Chay that “I’m in another Court right now … I actually have a 9:30 matter”

In this connection, when PDJ Toh asked him again whether he was representing Mr Li for the trial, it caused him to answer PDJ Toh in the affirmative.

By this, it appears that at the latest, before the hearing commenced before PDJ Toh, there would have been some discussion of the situation Mr Ravi found himself in, and some understanding that Mr Ravi would act for Mr Li for the trial. Unfortunately, in these proceedings, Mr Ravi does not provide any further details on the discussion with Mr Li that morning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, in oral submissions before me, Mr Ravi stated that, in light of the situation he was facing, “[he] appointed [himself] … ‘appointed [himself]’ meaning with the <span class="font-italic">consent</span> of [his] client, to continue with the proceedings as such [emphasis added]”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This also suggests that there was a discussion with Mr Li regarding Mr Ravi’s representation of the latter prior to the commencement of the hearing before PDJ Toh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For present purposes, it is not necessary for me to determine <span class="font-italic">exactly </span>what the understanding was with Mr Li concerning representation for the trial in SC 901420. In my view, there remains a reasonable doubt that Mr Ravi had been engaged by Mr Li for the trial when he appeared before DJ Chay. Based on the analysis above, at the highest, it seems to me that the understanding was reached with Mr Li <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to the hearing before PDJ Toh. The pertinent question, however, is whether this happened prior to the hearing before DJ Chay. In my view, there is a distinct possibility, which is not fanciful, that the discussion with Mr Li took place <span class="font-italic">after </span>the appearance before DJ Chay. From [6]–[7] above, there was a window of about 25 minutes between the two hearings that further instructions could have been obtained by Mr Ravi from Mr Li. I reiterate that based on the correspondence to the court prior to that morning, Mr Ravi was not supposed to be acting for Mr Li at the trial. Given these facts and circumstances, I am inclined to give Mr Ravi the benefit of doubt on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The AG argues that Mr Ravi’s defence is contradicted by his version of the events given to Dr Lim. At paragraph 21 of Dr Lim’s Report which is set out above at [28], it was recorded that Mr Ravi “went to court <span class="font-italic">thinking that he could discharge</span><span class="font-italic"> himself from another case the next day</span> hence told the judge he would be available on the dates that were asked of him” [emphasis added].

</div> This version contradicted the defence, and demonstrate that his defence is a mere afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Although paragraph 21 of Dr Lim’s Report falls under the header “Defendant’s Account of Alleged Offences”, the relevant portion of Dr Lim’s Report does not appear to be a verbatim record of what was said by Mr Ravi. As pointed out by Mr Ravi, this portion could well have been rephrased or summarised by Dr Lim. Furthermore, I note Mr Ravi’s submission that even if he used the words, he was not talking “technically [about] the discharge for the trial as such”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I thus do not think it is sufficient to rely on the words “<span class="font-italic">discharge himself</span><span class="font-italic"> from another case</span>” to infer that at the material time when Mr Ravi appeared before DJ Chay, he had instructions to act for Mr Li for the trial. Although the version in Dr Lim’s Report, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> that Mr Ravi wanted to seek a discharge, </span>conflicts with the defence proffered that he wanted to “<span class="font-italic">seek an </span><span class="font-italic">adjournment </span>of the [SC 901420] trial” on the basis of the judicial review application, it is the latter which is actually somewhat supported by the relevant extracts of the transcript. Thus, I am unable to accept the AG’s submission, that on the ground that the defence conflicts with the version in Dr Lim’s Report, the defence is to be rejected as an afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Moreover, even taking Dr Lim’s Report at face value, the fact that Mr Ravi was thinking that he could discharge himself from SC 901420 suggests that Mr Ravi wanted to avoid any clash of trial dates by making some arrangement as regards SC 901420. This casts doubt on the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> element of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether Mr Ravi <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> provided false information to DJ Chay on his availability for the trial of SC 904600. Consequently, I am of the view that even if Mr Ravi had incorrectly represented his availability to DJ Chay, there is insufficient evidence to show that this was intentional or that he did so with the knowledge that his act would pose a real risk of obstructing the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Undoubtedly, the “double-fixing” of trial dates was attributable to Mr Ravi’s mismanagement of his schedule, and he should have made suitable arrangements for <span class="font-italic">both</span> trials. In particular, he should have kept Mr Magendran informed of the situation after confirming to PDJ Toh that he would act for Mr Li. As it transpired, Mr Magendran did not know that Mr Ravi would not turn up on time on 9 November 2021. Eventually, Mr Magendran had to act in person. It may also well be that Mr Ravi was not perfectly candid at the hearing before PDJ Toh on 8 November 2021 with regard to the arrangements with Mr Li. Be that as it may, while Mr Ravi’s overall conduct was blameworthy, I do not find him liable for the first allegation of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second allegation: Accusing DJ Chay of being “biased”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Turning to the second allegation under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA (see [23(b)] above), the AG has to show that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi, by accusing DJ Chay of bias, impugned the impartiality of the court and posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi intentionally levelled the accusation at DJ Chay; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ravi’s accusation does not constitute fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The AG argues that Mr Ravi’s unfounded allegation in open court on 9 November 2021 that DJ Chay was “biased” against him amounted to an act of contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA.

This falls squarely within the ambit of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA. As observed by the Court of Appeal, “[a]n assertion that a Judiciary would decide matters otherwise than in accordance with the merits is self-evidently among the most serious attacks that one can make against courts and the administration of justice” and “goes to the very heart and essence of the judicial mission” (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span> at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Furthermore, Mr Ravi’s allegations of bias were levelled against DJ Chay in open court and in the presence of Mr Magendran. I agree with the AG that Mr Ravi, by making references to “article 9(3)”, “section 395 of the CPC”, and “Justice Woo Bih Li”, was attempting to conjure up a false sheen of legitimacy, which although incoherent, would have caused a reasonable layman observing the proceeding to form the view that there were some legitimate bases for his accusations. This, in my view, posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Mr Ravi’s defence is that he was suffering from bipolar disorder which contributed to his actions. He relies on Dr Yeo’s Report and Dr Lim’s Report, the material parts of which are set out above at [27] and [28] above. Specifically, Mr Ravi relies on paragraph 22 of Dr Lim’s Report, which states that: “Usually [Mr Ravi] would be able to hold back but due to his irritability and frustrations that had been ongoing for a few weeks, together with all his thoughts about different cases, it intensified his frustrations and irritability. Therefore, he told the judge that he was bias against him for not listening to him and interrupted him as well.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I am of the view that Mr Ravi’s bipolar disorder does not exculpate him from liability. Like paragraph 21, paragraph 22 of Dr Lim’s Report falls under the header “Defendant’s Account of Alleged Offences”, making it clear that the paragraph was Mr Ravi’s account of events to Dr Lim. The contents do not constitute Dr Lim’s professional assessment. Nowhere in Dr Yeo’s Report or Dr Lim’s Report is it stated that Mr Ravi made these statements in court (see [61] above) involuntarily, or that his bipolar disorder <span class="font-italic">negated</span> his <span class="font-italic">intention</span> in making these statements. While Mr Ravi might have experienced symptoms such as “flight of ideas”, “pressured speech” and “irritability”, individually or collectively, these did not mean that he was incapable of forming the necessary intention to make these statements. On the contrary, it is noteworthy that Dr Lim opined, in his professional capacity, that the bipolar disorder was but a “contributory link” to the conduct, and that Mr Ravi was “not of unsound mind” at the material time of the incident (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 9 November 2021). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Indeed, I note that after the exchange set out at [61] above, the allegation of bias was <span class="font-italic">repeated </span>a short time later when Mr Ravi sought to take up an application under s 395 of the CPC.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, as I have stated (see [37] above), fair criticism is an element of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA, with the burden falling on the AG to establish the absence of fair criticism beyond a reasonable doubt. As pointed out by the AG, Mr Ravi’s allegations of bias against DJ Chay was in response to DJ Chay pointing out that he had been fixed for two trials that morning. There is clearly no rational basis for Mr Ravi to attack DJ Chay’s impartiality. Furthermore, Mr Ravi’s allegations cannot be said to be made in good faith or expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner. Therefore, I find that the AG has shown that Mr Ravi’s words did not constitute fair criticism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Consequently, I find that the AG has established this instance of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third, fourth and fifth allegations: Repeatedly interrupting and insulting DJ Chay </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Next, I consider the AG’s third to fifth allegations (see [23(c)]–[23(e)] above) that Mr Ravi acted in contempt of court by (a) interrupting DJ Chay while DJ Chay was trying to speak to Mr Magendran on 9 November 2021; (b) offering an insult to DJ Chay by stating that he could be “removed…at will by the State” on 9 November 2021; and (c) offering an insult to DJ Chay by stating that he was “in contempt of Court” and “[didn’t] have security of tenure [and knew] what it means” on 10 November 2021. Since the AG grouped these allegations together in its written submissions as matters under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA, I will proceed to deal with them together.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 To prove these allegations, it has to be shown that Mr Ravi offered the insults and caused the interruption to DJ Chay while he was sitting in court proceedings, that Mr Ravi intentionally did so, and that he knew or ought to have known that doing so posed a real risk of prejudice to the course of the court proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In relation to the third allegation, in my view, the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>is clearly met on the facts. The transcript showed multiple instances in which Mr Ravi interrupted DJ Chay. The relevant portions are reproduced below:

Despite several reminders by DJ Chay that he wished to speak with and hear from Mr Magendran, Mr Ravi continued to interrupt DJ Chay by speaking in a language other than English, and then stated that Mr Magendran looked confused. In fact, thereafter, Mr Magendran stated that he had “no option but to follow [his] Defence Counsel’s advice” and applied for an adjournment of the matter. By repeatedly interrupting DJ Chay before DJ Chay could even finish his sentences, Mr Ravi’s conduct is neither respectful nor courteous to DJ Chay and inevitably interrupted the proceeding within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Mr Ravi argues that he only made a limited number of interruptions before “allowing” DJ Chay to speak to Mr Magendran.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As a preliminary point, Mr Ravi is not in a position to “allow” DJ Chay to speak to Mr Magendran. More importantly, even if there were only a limited number of interruptions, it does not change the fact that Mr Ravi clearly disrupted the course of proceedings. The assessment of whether there was an interruption of the proceeding within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA is a <span class="font-italic">qualitative </span>exercise, and not merely a quantitative one based on the number of interruptions. At most, it seems to me that the number of interruptions may be a factor to be considered at the sentencing stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Again, Mr Ravi relies on his bipolar disorder to challenge the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> elements in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and s 3(6) of the AJPA, arguing that (a) he did not intend to interrupt DJ Chay; and (b) he did not know or could not have known that his interruptions would obstruct the course of the court proceedings. I reject these submissions. As I have discussed at [65] above, the medical reports do not suggest that Mr Ravi interrupted DJ Chay involuntarily, or that he was unaware of the consequences of his conduct in the proceedings. Mr Ravi’s sole purpose in interrupting DJ Chay was to prevent DJ Chay from speaking to Mr Magendran, which, in my view, constitutes a clear intention to interrupt the course of the court proceedings. By causing such interruptions in open court in such a disrespectful manner, Mr Ravi would also have known that his conduct would have lowered the dignity and decorum of court proceedings, and be a real risk of prejudice to the conduct of the court proceeding. Consequently, I find Mr Ravi liable under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA for the third allegation of interrupting DJ Chay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For completeness, I should add that Mr Ravi’s conduct is also unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor. Rules 13(2) and 13(3) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 provide that a legal practitioner must always be respectful of a court or tribunal and must always be courteous in the conduct of a case. If it is necessary to confer privately with a client, counsel should seek permission from the court and should not, in any case, prevent the judge from communicating with the parties in the proceeding, much less speak in a different language to interrupt the judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Turning to the fourth and fifth allegations, shortly after DJ Chay explained to Mr Magendran that an adjournment would not be granted, Mr Ravi alleged that DJ Chay had breached Mr Magendran’s constitutional right to counsel and claimed that DJ Chay, unlike High Court Judges, could be “removed … at will by the State”.

</div>
</div> On the next day, after DJ Chay rejected Mr Ravi’s application under s 395 of the CPC, Mr Ravi alleged that DJ Chay was in contempt of court, that DJ Chay did not have “security of tenure” and that he “knows what it means”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The ordinary meaning of “to insult” is to show arrogance or scorn by speech or behaviour. Accordingly, “an insult” is defined as an act, or the action, of insulting (see <span class="font-italic">The Oxford English Dictionary</span> (Oxford University Press, 1989)). It seems clear that by stating that DJ Chay did not have the security of tenure unlike Judges in the High Court, Mr Ravi was belittling DJ Chay and undermining his status as a member of the Singapore judiciary. In my view, these scornful comments are clearly insults made by Mr Ravi towards DJ Chay to retaliate against DJ Chay for rejecting his applications. Such unwarranted insults fall squarely within the ambit of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The context in which the comments were made also suggests to me that Mr Ravi was directly challenging DJ Chay’s authority in open court. In particular, on 10 November 2021, he also said that “if [DJ Chay] continues with the trial, he’s in contempt of Court” and that “[a] crime against humanity complaint will be also filed [against DJ Chay]”.

</div> Such unfounded allegations attacked the standing of DJ Chay, and when made in open court, pose a real risk of prejudice to the course of the court proceeding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 During the hearing before me, Mr Ravi submitted that these comments constitute fair criticism.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I make two points in this regard. First, while not specifically argued before me, I am of the view that fair criticism does not apply in relation to acts falling within s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It will be recalled that the only instance where the concept of fair criticism is provided for in the APJA is in Explanation 1 to s 3 of the APJA, which applies only in relation to scandalising contempt within s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).  Fair criticism is not provided for in relation to s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA. Neither is the defence of fair criticism found in Part 4 of the AJPA, which sets out a number of legal defences to contempt. The reason for this can be found in the Explanatory Statement of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill (Bill No 23/2016), the relevant portions of which are reproduced below: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… The <span class="font-italic">Explanation </span>1 to clause 3(1) establishes that fair criticism does not amount to scandalising the court. This is in accordance with the provisional view of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan v Attorney-General</span> [2011] SGCA 26 that fair criticism goes towards liability for contempt of court. In accordance with this approach, Part 4 does not provide for a separate defence of fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As explained above in relation to clause 3, this Bill confirms the Court of Appeal’s view in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan v Attorney-General</span> [2011] SGCA 26 that the concept of “fair criticism” goes towards liability for contempt of court. Accordingly, the defence of fair criticism is absent from Part 4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 From the above, it is clear that save for s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic">, </span>Parliament did not intend to provide for fair criticism either as an element towards liability under any other limb of s 3(1) of the AJPA or as a defence to acts of contempt generally. I should add that s 8(2) of the AJPA has repealed all defences at common law to contempt of court not contained in the AJFA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, and in any event, I am of the view that Mr Ravi’s comments would not constitute fair criticism. Regardless of any factual basis for his comments, there is no reason for Mr Ravi to make these comments during the proceedings. These comments bore no relevance to Mr Ravi’s application for adjournment or his application under s 395 of the CPC. Nor did they relate to any possible point of law that may arise from the issues in SC 904600. Mr Ravi also delivered those remarks in an offensive manner. These comments only served to insult DJ Chay, as a means to protest DJ Chay’s rejection of his applications. Consequently, I reject Mr Ravi’s arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Next, Mr Ravi argues that he did not “intentionally” insult DJ Chay because he genuinely thought that he had a basis for what he was saying due to his bipolar disorder.

</div> Mr Ravi also argues that due to his bipolar disorder, he did not know or could not have known that his insults to DJ Chay would have posed a real risk of prejudice to the course of the court proceeding. However, as I have found above at [65], his condition did not render him incapable of forming the necessary intention to make those insults. Neither did the condition prevent him from being aware of the consequences of his conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Mr Ravi is a senior practitioner at the bar. His offensive manner shows that his insults were intentional. Given his experience, he ought to have known that the offensive and disrespectful comments towards DJ Chay on 9 November 2021 and 10 November 2021 would tend to diminish DJ Chay’s standing and undermine DJ Chay’s authority in the eyes of the public, and especially in the eyes of Mr Magendran, and thus pose a real risk of prejudice to the course of the court proceeding. Consequently, I find that the elements under ss 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and 3(6) of the AJPA are satisfied such that Mr Ravi is guilty of contempt in relation to these allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Given the above, I find Mr Ravi guilty of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA in relation to the third to fifth allegations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HC/SUM 669/2022</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sixth allegation: Accusing Lim J of being “biased”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Moving to SUM 669, the AG’s sixth allegation is that Mr Ravi scandalised the court on 22 November 2021 by accusing Lim J of being “biased” within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA (see [24(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In order for the AG to succeed on this ground, it must be shown that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi intentionally accused Lim J of being biased in favour of Mr Singh on 22 November 2021; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi’s accusations against Lim J impugned the impartiality of the court and posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ravi’s accusations do not constitute fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Upon a review of the transcript, it clearly shows that when Lim J was trying to provide directions for the cross-examination of Mr Chua, Mr Ravi accused Lim J of being “biased” multiple times and asked her to discharge herself from the case.

Lim J’s directions in relation to the cross-examination of Mr Chua were common and sensible ones, and furthermore did not favour one party over another (above at [89]). There was absolutely no reason at all for Mr Ravi to levy the accusations of bias. These allegations attack the impartiality of the court. As mentioned above, the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary “goes to the very heart and essence of the judicial mission” (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span> at [33]). Such unwarranted accusations of partiality and favouritism in open court undermine public confidence in the administration of justice and constitute contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In relation to <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>, it is clear from the transcript that Mr Ravi’s allegations of bias towards Lim J stemmed from his unhappiness with Lim J’s directions as regards the cross-examination of Mr Chua. The allegations of bias were made thrice during his exchange with Lim J and must evidently have been intentional.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 While Mr Ravi does not dispute this ground in the Respondent’s written submissions, I note that he raises the fact that he was suffering from bipolar disorder at the material time, which “contributed to [his] state of mind in making the statements pertaining to bias” against Lim J.

</div>
</div>
</div> In paragraph 24 of Dr Lim’s Report, she recorded that Mr Ravi reported “lack of clarity on his thoughts”, and that he “could not process information well”. He felt that Lim J was “rude and dismissive”. Unlike usual, he could not control himself, and he felt “more irritated and frustrated, leading him to saying that she was biased”. However, as discussed above at [65], nothing in the Dr Lim’s Report suggested that Mr Ravi was unaware of his actions at the material time, or that he was incapable of forming the necessary intention to make those allegations against Lim J. Dr Yeo’s Report similarly made no such findings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For completeness, Mr Ravi’s allegations of bias towards Lim J do not constitute fair criticism. There is no rational basis for Mr Ravi to impugn Lim J’s impartiality merely because he disagreed with Lim J’s directions. The allegations were also not made in good faith, nor in a dispassionate and temperate manner (see [37] above). Consequently, I find Mr Ravi liable under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for contempt of court for his baseless allegations of bias towards Lim J.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Seventh allegation: Repeatedly interrupting Lim J </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The AG’s next ground is that Mr Ravi acted in contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) by repeatedly interrupting Lim J during the hearing on 22 November 2021 (see [24(b)] above). For Mr Ravi to be guilty of this allegation, it must be shown that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi intentionally and repeatedly interrupted Lim J during the 22 November 2021 hearing; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi knew or ought reasonably to have known that his repeated interruptions would pose a real risk of interference with the course of the court proceeding on that day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On the facts, the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>is clearly made out on the facts.

Despite being reminded by Lim J to stop interrupting, Mr Ravi continued to interrupt Lim J because he did not agree with Lim J’s directions. Mr Ravi continued to interrupt Lim J when Lim J was clearly trying to direct the interpreter to update Mr Chua on the state of the proceeding. Such repeated interruptions clearly obstructed the course of the proceeding within the meaning of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Mr Ravi disputes the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>element in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and s 3(6) of the AJPA. Again, he argues that he interrupted impulsively as a result of his bipolar disorder without any intention to do so. As he was suffering from symptoms of his bipolar disorder, including disorganized chains of thoughts, flight of ideas, and irritability, he did not know or could not reasonably have known the impact he was having on the court proceedings.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I dismiss Mr Ravi’s defence for the same reasons I have set out above in [93]. The medical reports do not suggest, neither do they conclude, that Mr Ravi’s bipolar disorder was so serious that he made those statements involuntarily, or that he was unaware of the consequences of his interruptions. Consequently, I find Mr Ravi liable of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the AJPA for repeatedly interrupting Lim J.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Eighth allegation: Alleging that Lim J’s directions were unlawful etc</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Apart from accusing Lim J of bias, Mr Ravi raised a host of other allegations about Lim J’s conduct of the proceedings, which the AG argues constituted contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA (see [24(c)] above). To be liable for contempt for these accusations, the AG must prove that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi intentionally made such allegations against Lim J; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi’s allegations impugned the impartiality of the court and posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ravi’s accusations do not constitute fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As set out above (at [12]), after an adjournment at about 10.22am, the proceedings resumed at 10.34am. At that point, Mr Singh informed Lim J that Mr Ravi had told him “[D]on’t be a clown” three times during the discussion. While Lim J was seeking clarification from Mr Ravi whether this had occurred, Mr Ravi called Lim J “the interrogator” and stated that Lim J was “putting words into [his] mouth”.

Counsel may disagree with a judge’s directions. However, the proper recourse, and the only acceptable way, is for counsel to state his or her objections respectfully and courteously and if necessary, comply with the proper procedure to file an appeal against the judge’s decision. Within the courtroom, there is no room for rudeness or disrespectful behaviour regardless of how fervent the counsel might be in the advocacy of his client’s case. The manner in which Mr Ravi disagreed with Lim J’s directions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, accusing Lim J of applying “wrongful law” and “illegal law”, was neither respectful nor courteous and should not be condoned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Further, I am of the view that Mr Ravi’s series of comments in the above exchange amounted to an act of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA. I appreciate that Mr Ravi’s comments stemmed from his disagreement with Lim J’s directions. However, his accusations, framed in an inappropriate and disrespectful manner, went beyond registering his objections to her directions. Instead, they went towards impugning the propriety of the court. A reasonable person listening to the remarks would understand them to mean that Lim J’s conduct of the proceedings was highly unsatisfactory and even fundamentally contrary to the law. Such allegations pose a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Further, it seems to me clear that Mr Ravi intended to make these comments as he persisted in making the allegations over the course of the proceedings. In relation to his reliance on the bipolar disorder, I need not repeat what I have said above (at [93]); it does not absolve Mr Ravi of liability for his conduct. Given the nature of the comments and the context in which they arose, these allegations do not amount to fair criticism. Therefore, I find that the Mr Ravi is liable under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ninth and tenth allegations: Taking legal positions without the instructions of client </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The AG argues that Mr Ravi is guilty of contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the AJPA for intentionally taking legal positions without Mr Chua’s instructions during the hearing of S 699, including applying for Lim J and Mr Chua to be discharged (see [24(d)] above), and for instructing Mr Arun to send the 24 November Email (see [24(e)] above). Since the AG has grouped these two instances in its written submissions as offences under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the AJPA, I proceed to deal with these allegations together. I repeat the elements under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) which the AG has to establish beyond a reasonable doubt: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Ravi committed acts which interfere with, obstruct or pose a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Ravi acted intentionally; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Ravi knew or ought reasonably to have known that the acts in question would interfere with, obstruct or pose a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Before I go to the allegations, I note the AG’s position that while there are no reported cases dealing with this provision, an advocate and solicitor who acts in court either without instructions or in a manner contrary to his client’s instructions poses a real risk of obstructing the administration of justice because this is tantamount to misleading the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I agree. Indeed, in our legal system, lawyers are trusted to be completely truthful about their clients’ instructions because they are the main conduits through which their clients could communicate with the court. A lawyer who acts against, or without, his client’s instruction breaches the trust that his client has reposed in him, posing a real risk of interfering with or obstructing court proceedings, and undermining public trust in the administration of justice. This was emphasised by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Der Ming Andrew v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2018] 3 SLR 837 at [135]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">135 … A client’s positions and instructions for his lawyer are usually matters exclusively within the knowledge of the client and the lawyer; no one else would know or be able to verify these instructions, and all parties including the court have to rely on the lawyer to communicate them. <span class="font-italic">In the context, a lawyer who is not truthful about his instructions poses a serious threat to the profession and the public trust in the administration of justice</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I turn to the applications for Lim J to disqualify herself. As set out at [89] above, Mr Ravi repeatedly applied for Lim J to disqualify herself on the ground of bias. After Lim J rejected his application, he requested for time to file a notice of appeal against the decision. Mr Ravi, however, argues that he “never took this legal position within the instructions of Mr Chua”. He pointed out that shortly after, he clarified that he was not applying for Lim J to discharge herself. The relevant portions of the transcript are below:

After the adjournment, he again stated that he was not proceeding with such an application. Mr Ravi also avers that his actions at the material time are justifiable as he was acting in his client’s best interests “on the spot during proceedings” and that he did eventually seek an adjournment to confirm his instructions from Mr Chua.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In sum, Mr Ravi submits that he did not act against Mr Chua’s instructions and is not liable for contempt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 There is no merit to Mr Ravi’s position. Not only did Mr Ravi make the application, he repeated it. He also persisted even after Lim J ruled against the application. Then, he proceeded to indicate that he wished to file an appeal against the ruling (see [89] above). Such conduct, in my view, is clearly intentional and deliberate. An application for a judge to recuse or disqualify herself is one that should not be lightly made. It should not be made unless it is well founded. Rather than helping Mr Ravi’s case, the subsequent swift change in position to abandon the application supports the inference that Mr Ravi did not act <span class="font-italic">with </span>instructions from Mr Chua in the first place. Indeed, after the adjournment to speak with Mr Chua, Mr Ravi confirmed that he would not pursue the matter. In this case, acting without instructions to apply to disqualify Lim J, and thereafter indicating an appeal would be filed, did not merely pose a real risk of interference with the administration of justice. It caused an actual disruption to the proceeding as Lim J had to take time to deal with the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Next, I turn to the application for Mr Chua to be “discharged from the proceedings”. As Mr Chua is not counsel but a party in the action, it seems to me that there is no basis for such an application, and it is erroneous. I surmise that what Mr Ravi really means is for Mr Chua to apply for leave to withdraw the proceedings or to discontinue the proceedings. Be that as it may, for convenience, I shall refer to this as “Mr Chua’s discharge application”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In relation to “Mr Chua’s discharge application”, it is unclear to me whether Mr Ravi<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> acted against Mr Chua’s instructions during the hearing on 22 November 2021. Although Mr Lim Tean informed Lim J on 29 November 2021 that “Mr Chua’s discharge application” was made “totally without his instructions”, Mr Chua has not filed an affidavit stating the same. The transcript also suggests that there could have been some confusion on Mr Chua’s part during the hearing. This is especially when Mr Chua appeared to have no objections when Mr Ravi applied to Lim J to discharge himself and Mr Chua from the proceedings. The relevant portion of the transcript is set out below:

</div>
</div> Mr Chua, similarly, did not object to this application despite it being raised several times after the break. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I am of the view that there could have been some confusion as to Mr Chua’s position during the hearing on 22 November 2021. When Mr Ravi asked Mr Chua whether he understood that Mr Chua would “discharge” himself from the proceeding, Mr Chua replied that he understood (see [114] above). While it appears that Mr Ravi did not provide adequate information on the consequences of the course of action for Mr Chua to make an informed decision at that point in time, that is a separate issue from whether Mr Ravi acted <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> against Mr Chua’s instructions in making “Mr Chua’s discharge application” during the hearing on 22 November 2021. In the absence of any affidavit from Mr Chua, I am prepared to give Mr Ravi the benefit of doubt on this aspect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Consequently, in relation to the ninth allegation, I find that only the instance of contempt in making the application for Lim J to disqualify herself is made out. Insofar as the defence relying on the bipolar disorder is concerned, once again, I find that the condition does not absolve Mr Ravi of liability (see [93] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Turning to the tenth allegation, the AG argues that Mr Ravi had intentionally acted against Mr Chua’s instructions by instructing Mr Arun to send the 24 November Email. The AG argues that the 24 November Email created the impression that Mr Chua intended to proceed to trial with Mr Ravi as counsel, when Mr Chua’s instructions have been that he intended to engage new counsel. I find that both the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) are made out for this allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In Mr Chua’s Letter which was sent to the Registry after the conclusion of proceedings, Mr Chua stated clearly and unequivocally that he intended to continue with S 699 and wanted an adjournment of S 699 to engage new counsel.

</div>
</div> Despite his knowledge, Mr Ravi instructed Mr Arun to send the 24 November Email, the relevant portions of which state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We refer to the directions from the honourable court dated 22 November 2021, where we have been directed to file the application to disqualify her honour (Justice Audrey Lim) by 12pm 23 November 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since then, we have reconsidered the position and <span class="font-italic">we would like to proceed with the trial</span>.

However, given the lateness of the notice <span class="font-italic">we are ready to start the trial at any time tomorrow subject to your honours' direction.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Despite Mr Ravi’s knowledge that Mr Chua intended to discharge him and engage new counsel, the 24 November Email made no mention of the same. Instead, a plain reading of the 24 November Email suggests the opposite — that Mr Chua wanted Mr Ravi to continue to represent him in S 699 and wanted to proceed with the trial on 24 November 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Mr Ravi argues that the 24 November Email was ambiguous because it did not expressly state that Mr Chua wished to be represented by Mr Ravi in the trial.

</div> However, the statements “<span class="font-italic">we </span>would like to proceed with trial” and “<span class="font-italic">we </span>are ready to start the trial at any time tomorrow subject to your honours’ direction” means that Mr Ravi would continue to represent Mr Chua for the trial. More importantly, the representation that Mr Chua was ready to proceed with trial at 10am on 24 November 2021, which was mere hours from the time the e-mail was sent, directly contradicted Mr Chua’s intention to discharge Mr Ravi and seek an adjournment to engage new counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Mr Ravi also argues that he did not intend to create the false impression that Mr Chua wished to proceed with trial immediately or that Mr Chua wished to be represented by him in S 699.

</div> However, the circumstances of the case suggest otherwise. Mr Ravi was aware of Mr Chua’s intention to discharge him and engage a new lawyer, but this material fact was completely omitted in the 24 November Email. Moreover, Mr Arun’s evidence is that when Mr Ravi instructed him to send the 24 November Email, Mr Ravi <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> told him not to copy the e-mail to Mr Chua.

</div>
</div> Mr Ravi has not offered any satisfactory explanation as to why Mr Chua should not be apprised of the communications between his firm and the Registry. In the circumstances, I am of the view that Mr Ravi acted intentionally in causing Mr Arun to send the e-mail and in creating the impression that Mr Chua wished to continue being represented by him in S 699. By deliberately making representations against Mr Chua’s instructions, Mr Ravi breached the trust Mr Chua reposed in him, and posed a real risk of interference with the administration of justice. Indeed, the e-mail caused confusion on the part of the court as to how it should proceed with the case, and the Registry had to seek clarification from K K Cheng LLC on the matter (see [19] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Mr Ravi further argues that he did not know and could not reasonably have known, at the time the 24 November Email was sent, that his actions would interfere with, obstruct or prejudice the administration of justice or pose a real risk of the same.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I disagree. As I stated above, lawyers have to be trusted to truthfully represent their clients’ instructions to the court. Despite knowing that Mr Chua intended to adjourn the proceeding and engage new counsel, Mr Ravi created a false impression that Mr Chua wished to proceed with trial immediately and worse still, kept Mr Chua out of the loop by instructing Mr Arun not to copy Mr Chua in the correspondence. Mr Ravi ought to have known that by acting without Mr Chua’s instructions, he would have posed a real risk of obstructing the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 To the extent that Mr Ravi attributes the 24 November Email to his bipolar disorder, I dismiss his defence for the same reasons set out in [93] above. The medical reports do not suggest that Mr Ravi was suffering from relapse on 24 November 2021, nor do they suggest that Mr Ravi was unaware of his actions and consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 For completeness, during the hearing before me, Mr Ravi argues that the AG has breached legal professional privilege because they relied on communications between Mr Ravi and his paralegal, Mr Arun, without first informing him.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I dismiss this argument. From his oral submissions, it appears that he is relying on solicitor-client privilege between him and Mr Chua. However, Mr Chua had discharged Mr Ravi “immediately” after the proceedings on 22 November 2021 and this was communicated by Mr Lim Tean to Lim J at the hearing on 29 November 2021. This is supported by Mr Chua’s Letter seeking an adjournment to engage new counsel. Therefore, at the time Mr Ravi communicated with Mr Arun on 23 November 2021, there was no solicitor-client relationship between Mr Ravi and Mr Chua. In fact, the essence of the AG’s case is that the 24 November 2021 email was sent against Mr Chua’s instructions to discharge Mr Ravi. In my view, there can be no solicitor-client privilege arising from Mr Ravi’s communication with Mr Arun that is made <span class="font-italic">against </span>Mr Chua’s instructions.
