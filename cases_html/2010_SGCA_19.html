        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the appellant (“the
                    Appellant”), the owner of the land comprised in Lot 187-157 on which
                    house No 72 Belmont Road is erected, against the decision of the High
                    Court allowing the counterclaim of the respondents (“the
                    Respondents”), the owners of the adjacent land comprised in Lot 185-156
                    on which house No 70 Belmont Road is erected. The Respondents’
                    counterclaim was that, as the owners of Lot 185-156, they were entitled to a
                    right of way over part of the Appellant’s land (for convenience, the land
                    that comprises this right of way will be referred to hereafter as
                    “plot B”) as shown in the sketch plan in the
                    Annex hereto (“Sketch Plan”). In these grounds of decision,
                    we shall refer to both lots of land by the street numbers of the houses erected
                    thereon, <em>ie</em>, 70 Belmont Road for Lot 185-156
                    and 72 Belmont Road for Lot 185-157.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondents’ counterclaim was made in
                    response to an action by the Appellant for an injunction in Suit No 674 of
                    2007 to restrain the Respondents from building a gate (“the common
                    gate”) at the entrance of an access road (for convenience, the land that
                    comprises this right of way will be referred to hereafter as
                    “plot A”) where it meets Belmont Road. As shown in the Sketch
                    Plan, plot A leads to, and is part of the land on which is erected
                    70 Belmont Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The High Court Judge (“the Judge”)
                    dismissed the Appellant’s action and allowed the Respondents’
                    counterclaim (see <em>Lian Kok Hong v Lee Choi Kheong &amp;
                        Others</em> [2009] SGHC 18 (“the GD”)). At the
                    conclusion of oral pleadings before us, we allowed the appeal. We now give our
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Both 70 and 72 Belmont Road were part and parcel
                    of the same property comprised in Lot 187-102 until their common owner
                    subdivided the land and sold 70 Belmont Road to the Respondents’
                    predecessor in title in 1949, whilst retaining ownership of 72 Belmont
                    Road. 72 Belmont Road fronts Belmont Road directly whilst 70 Belmont
                    Road is situated behind 72 Belmont Road. Since 1949, both 70 and
                    72 Belmont Road have changed ownership many times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It can be seen from the Sketch Plan that, after
                    the subdivision of Lot 187-102 in 1949, the owner of 70 Belmont Road would
                    not have been able to gain access to Belmont Road except through plot A,
                    whilst the owner of 72 Belmont Road would have been able to do so through
                    both plot B and plot A. Nevertheless, the common owner of Lot 187-102
                    decided, upon its subdivision, to grant to the owner of 70 Belmont Road a right
                    of way over plot B and reserved to herself as the owner of 72 Belmont Road
                    a right of way over plot A (which was part of the subdivided lot on which
                    70 Belmont Road is erected). The transaction was effected by an Indenture
                    1056 No 101 dated 24 November 1949<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The express grant and reservation
                    of the two easements respectively provided for were as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                        annexed as is included in the Conveyance hereby made [<em>ie</em>, plot A – the access road].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As regards 72 Belmont Road, the Appellant
                    purchased it on 25 July 1994 from Peter Leo Chin Fang
                    (“Peter”) who had purchased the property from Koh Ah Kim
                    (“Koh”) on 18 February 1987. Koh in turn purchased the
                    property from Muriel Anna Hutchinson on 6 August 1971. Following this
                    transaction, 72 Belmont Road was brought under the Land Titles Act (now
                    Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the LTA”) on 15 December
                    1971, with a qualified title. The caution endorsed on the Certificate of Title
                    lapsed on 5 March 1987 and the title became unqualified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As for 70 Belmont Road, the Respondents
                    purchased their property on 20 September 2007 from Gan Boon Hwee
                    (“Gan”) who had purchased it from Tsang Shou Meng
                    (“Tsang”) on 4 October 1986. Tsang purchased the property on
                    10 February 1977 from Singapore Oxygen Air Liquide Pte Ltd
                    (“Singapore Oxygen”) which had bought the property on
                    1 December 1971 from Far East Oxygen &amp; Acetylene Company Ltd
                    (“FEOAC”). Following the purchase of the property on
                    10 February 1977, 70 Belmont Road was brought under the LTA on
                    22 December 1977, with a qualified title. The caution endorsed on the
                    Certificate of Title lapsed on 4 October 1986 and the title became
                    unqualified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       What happened next after Koh purchased
                    72 Belmont Road in 1971 which is material to the dispute in this case was
                    that she constructed a chain-linked fence along the common boundary of the two
                    houses and fenced off plot A. The fence effectively became a party wall
                    separating the two properties and deprived FEOAC, the then owner of
                    70 Belmont Road, of its right of way over plot B (which was adjacent
                    to plot A) to gain access to Belmont Road. The Respondents’ case is
                    that the fence was constructed around 1980 (according to the evidence of their
                    surveyor). In our view, however, the fence was most likely constructed on or
                    before August 1973 when the renovation plans of 70 Belmont Road showing the
                    existence of the fence were approved by the Building Control Division. However,
                    what is more material to the dispute in this case, and which was not, and could
                    not be, denied, is that there is no evidence that FEOAC had ever objected to
                    plot B being fenced off and thereby preventing FEOAC from using plot B
                    as a right of way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Since then, plot B had been fenced off,
                    unavailable for use as a right of way to all successive owners of
                    70 Belmont Road until the issue as to its existence was raised by the
                    Respondents in their counterclaim. It seems clear that they would not have made
                    the counterclaim to the right of way over plot B, but for the action
                    commenced by the Appellant which has led to this appeal. The Appellant’s
                    reply to the counterclaim was that the right of way had been extinguished by
                    express or implied consent of the previous owners of 70 Belmont Road or by
                    surrender of the usage of the easement by the previous owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge held that the easement continued to
                    subsist for the reasons set out at [2] of the GD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence showed that when 70 and 72 Belmont Road were created in
                        1949 under Indenture 1056 N0 101 (by sub-dividing 70 Belmont Road from
                        the parent lot), the then owner also created mutual easements over both
                        properties. The owner of 72 Belmont Road was entitled to an easement
                        through the access road which was part of the property of 70 Belmont
                        Road and the owners of 70 Belmont Road had a right of easement over a
                        part of the property belonging to 72 Belmont Road. This part of the
                        mutual easement had been walled off since it was part of the
                        [Appellant’s] land. It was not known to the parties that the
                        [Respondents’] easement had been blocked in this way because what was
                        shown on the sketch plans was not obvious on site. The easements were
                        created to be mutually co-existing and one could not be abandoned without
                        the abandonment of the other. The mere encroachment by walling off the
                        easement by the previous owner was not by itself sufficient proof of
                        abandonment. I find that there was no abandonment of the easement as alleged
                        by the [Appellant].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the Appellant contended that the
                    Judge’s decision was wrong on three grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that one “mutual” easement could
                            not be abandoned without the abandonment of the other;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that there was no abandonment of the easement;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that, in any case, the right of way over
                            plot B was extinguished.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">We will deal with these three grounds in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mutuality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We agree that the Judge was wrong to hold that
                    on the facts of this case the easements over plots A and B were created to
                    be mutually co-existing and that, therefore, one could not be abandoned without
                    abandoning the other. There was no evidence of such intention on the part of the
                    creator of the easements. On the facts, this conclusion was clearly wrong as the
                    right of way over plot B could be abandoned without affecting the right of
                    way of both owners over plot A. It might be that if the mutual easements
                    together constituted a right of way of necessity for both owners, neither
                    easement could be abandoned without one house becoming landlocked. Except on
                    this ground, there is, in principle, no reason why one dominant owner may not
                    abandon his right of way over the relevant servient tenement, if he is still
                    able to access the main road without the use of the right of way over the
                    servient tenement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     To put the materiality of the
                    Respondents’ counterclaim in perspective, the width of plot A is
                    sufficiently wide for vehicles to pass and repass to and from 70 Belmont
                    Road to Belmont Road. The fencing off of plot B did not appear to have
                    caused any inconvenience to any of the successive owners of 70 Belmont
                    Road, including the Respondents, from accessing Belmont Road. The counterclaim
                    for the restoration of the right of way over plot B appeared to have been
                    the Respondents’ tit-for-tat response to the Appellant’s unwise and
                    wrongful action in trying to prevent the Respondents from building the common
                    gate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsistence of right of way under s 46(1) of the LTA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The right of way over plot B, as is the
                    right of way over plot A, is subject to the common law as both easements
                    were created before the relevant lands were brought under the LTA.
                    72 Belmont Road was brought under the LTA on 15 December 1971 and
                    70 Belmont Road was brought under the LTA on 22 December 1977. Section
                    46 of the LTA confers an indefeasible title on the registered proprietor in the
                    circumstances. However, s 46(1)(c)(ii) subjects such indefeasibility to any
                    “subsisting easement … which was in existence at the date on which
                    the land was brought under the provisions of [the LTA]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the case of 72 Belmont Road, the land
                    was brought under the LTA on 15 December 1971. On that day, the owner of
                    70 Belmont Road undoubtedly had a subsisting right of way over plot B.
                    It was only after Koh had become the proprietor of 72 Belmont Road that, as
                    part of the renovations to the house, she fenced off the right of way. The Judge
                    held (at [2] of the GD) that the mere encroachment by walling off the easement
                    by Koh was not in itself sufficient proof of abandonment. Counsel for the
                    Appellant accepted this statement of principle but contended that there was
                    sufficient evidence of acts of abandonment or acquiescence by the successive
                    owners of 70 Belmont Road to justify the court making a finding of
                    abandonment under the law. What the facts show is that the action of Koh in
                    fencing off plot B would have been done openly, and the owners (through the
                    actual occupiers) of 72 Belmont Road would have seen it happening or would
                    have known about it shortly after plot B had been fenced off. Evidently,
                    they did not object to plot B being fenced off or consider Koh’s
                    action worth protesting against. The facts also show that all successive owners
                    of 70 and 72 Belmont Road (up to September 2007 when the Respondents
                    purchased 70 Belmont Road) conducted themselves as if either the right of
                    way had never existed or that they had no use for it, since they knew or ought
                    to have known of the prior existence of the easement as any competent
                    conveyancer would have ascertained this with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In our view, if the proprietor of
                    70 Belmont Road had, in 1971 or shortly thereafter, taken action to recover
                    the right of way over plot B, he would have been entitled to do so and that
                    action alone would have confirmed that the right of way had not been abandoned.
                    The next entry in the Register of Titles regarding 72 Belmont Road is on
                    5 March 1987 when Peter became the registered proprietor. On the same day,
                    the caution which had been notified on the title lapsed, and the title became
                    unqualified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When Peter contracted to purchase
                    72 Belmont Road in December 1986, the title to the land was still qualified
                    title and therefore he was obliged to investigate the title for subsisting
                    encumbrances. If he and/or his solicitors had checked the Indenture of
                    Conveyance dated 5 December 1947<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> or the Indenture dated
                    11 May 1951<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, the right of way over plot B
                    would have been discovered. But if they had checked the Indenture of Conveyance
                    dated 8 October 1954<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, they would not have found a right of
                    way mentioned in that conveyance. How far they went to investigate title, we do
                    not know. But, they would not have seen plot B except as part of the land
                    on which 72 Belmont Road was erected. Indeed, Peter might have purchased
                    the land on the basis of “as is, where is”, <em>ie</em>, there was no visible right of way over any part of the land
                    on which 72 Belmont was erected. Thus, if the right of way over plot B had
                    been abandoned or extinguished, he would have obtained an indefeasible title by
                    virtue of s 46(1) of the LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The next purchaser of 72 Belmont Road is
                    the Appellant who became the registered proprietor of the property on
                    25 July1994. That would be about seven years after the title to
                    72 Belmont Road became unqualified and about 21 years after Koh had
                    fenced off plot B. There would have been no reason for the Appellant to
                    know of the previous existence of plot B or the right of way over it,
                    unless his solicitor had investigated title going back more than 30 years.
                    We have no evidence on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Let us now look at the chronology of
                    transactions concerning 70 Belmont Road, the dominant tenement <em>vis-à-vis</em> the right of way over plot B. The
                    Respondents became the proprietors on 20 September 2007, having purchased
                    the property from Gan who became the proprietor on 4 October 1986. Gan had
                    purchased the property on or about 8 July 1986 from Tsang who became the
                    owner on 10 February 1977. Now, after Tsang became the owner,
                    70 Belmont Road was brought under the LTA on 22 December 1977 and a
                    qualified Certificate of Title Vol 198 Fol 61 was issued to Tsang. Attached
                    to the Certificate of Title was a plan of the land (Lot 187-156) showing
                    plot A as the only right of way in existence. This plan also shows broken
                    lines demarcating what was plot B on Lot 187-157 (on which 72 Belmont
                    Road is erected).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     These facts show two things: first, the
                    Respondents purchased 70 Belmont Road with no expectation of having such a
                    right of way over plot B since a visual examination of the site would not
                    have shown plot B as part of the access road to either 70 Belmont Road or
                    72 Belmont Road. In other words, they did not pay a purchase price which
                    had factored in the benefit of a visible right of way. Neither had Gan nor Tsang
                    when they respectively acquired title to the property. But if they did, they did
                    not take any steps to recover the right of way. By the time the Respondents
                    purchased 70 Belmont Road in September 2007, the total period of
                    acquiescence was more than 30 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The question is whether these circumstances
                    were sufficient for us to infer that the right of way over plot B was no longer
                    a subsisting easement under s 46(1)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of
                    the LTA when the Respondents became proprietors on 20 September 2007 for
                    the reason that it had been abandoned or that it had been extinguished by
                    operation of law prior to that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abandonment and Extinguishment of Easements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The word “subsisting” is not
                    defined in s 46(1)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the LTA but, in
                    our view, it must mean an easement which the dominant owner is entitled to
                    enjoy. The word “subsisting” does not mean visible, physically
                    existing, or legally extant. The easement would, however, not be subsisting if
                    it has been abandoned or extinguished in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the Appellant relied on both
                    abandonment and extinguishment in this case. He contended that there was
                    abandonment in law and, alternatively, the right of way over plot B was
                    extinguished by operation of law. We shall deal with the issue of abandonment
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the right of way abandoned by 1994 or 2007?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At common law, rights under an easement are
                    perpetual and, therefore, the court will not lightly infer that the dominant
                    owner would give it up for no consideration. Hence, mere non-user (<em>by itself</em>), without more, <em>however
                        long</em>, cannot amount to abandonment (<em>Gale on
                        Easements</em> (Jonathan Gaunt &amp; Paul Morgan eds) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 18<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) (“<em>Gale</em>”) at para 12-66). However, <em>Gale</em> also states at para 12-66 that a <em>presumption</em> of abandonment will arise in at least two
                    situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     where there are circumstances
                        adverse to the user and sufficient to explain the non-user, combined with a
                        substantial length of time during which the dominant owner has <em>acquiesced</em> in that state of affairs;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     where the
                        dominant owner does some act <em>clearly indicating the firm
                            intention</em> that neither he nor any successor in title of his
                        should thereafter make use of the easement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In a recent English High Court case, <em>viz</em>, <em>Odey and others v
                        Barber</em> [2007] 3 All ER 543 (“<em>Odey</em>”), Silber J restated the principles as follows
                    (at [103], see further, <em>Gale</em> at

                            Easements</em> as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Whether a person intends an abandonment is not

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Abandonment depends on the intention of the
                                person alleged to be abandoning the right of way as perceived by the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the Appellant relied on the above
                    passage from <em>Gale</em> and submitted that his case was
                    not a case of “mere non-user” but something more. The construction
                    of the fence in 1971 was an adverse circumstance to the user, coupled with the
                    substantial length of time during which three successive owners of
                    70 Belmont Road had acquiesced in that state of affairs, constituted
                    grounds for finding that abandonment had taken place. When the fence was
                    constructed between 1971 and 1973, the then owner of 70 Belmont Road,
                    Singapore Oxygen did not protest; at least there is no evidence of any
                    protest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Singapore Oxygen conveyed 70 Belmont Road
                    to Tsang and in that conveyance (Indenture of Conveyance dated 10 February
                        1977<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>), the
                    right of way over plot B was described as “the roadway shown on the
                    plan annexed to an Indenture of Conveyance dated 24<sup>th</sup>
                    November 1949 (Registered in Volume 1056 No. 101) and made between
                    Elizabeth Gilmour Buchan of the one part and Group Estates Limited of the other
                    and thereon coloured Brown”. Accordingly, it is clear from this Indenture
                    that the right of way over plot B was conveyed to Tsang, and he should have
                    known about plot B. On taking possession of 70 Belmont Road, he should
                    have known that plot B had been fenced off, but he did nothing about it. We
                    can only conclude that he was satisfied with using plot A for the purpose
                    of accessing Belmont Road. Neither was there any protest forthcoming from the
                    successors in title, <em>viz</em>, Gan from October 1986 to
                    September 2007 when the Respondents became the owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     By the time the Appellant purchased
                    72 Belmont Road in February 1994, plot B had been fenced off for more
                    than 20 years without any protest by the successive owners of 70 Belmont
                    Road. If the doctrine of adverse possession were applicable to the easement, the
                    Appellant’s immediate predecessor in title would have obtained a good
                    title against the easement on plot B. This situation subsisted for another
                    13 years, until 2007 when the Respondents raised the issue for the first time in
                    these proceedings to reclaim the right of way over plot B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In our view, these facts were sufficient for
                    us to conclude that the owners of 70 Belmont Road, the dominant tenement,
                    had abandoned the right of way. It was not so much the actual non-user that is
                    crucial in this case, but the long acquiescence by the successive owners of 70
                    Belmont Road to the right of way over plot B being fenced off. Such conduct
                    amounted to acquiescence to the right of way being rendered unusable and would
                    amount to a conscious act of abandonment. The acquiescence started with
                    Singapore Oxygen which was the owner of 70 Belmont Road from
                    1 December 1971 to 10 February 1977 and, at some point of time
                    thereafter, the owner of 72 Belmont Road would have inferred that the
                    dominant owner had decided to abandon the easement. As we have mentioned
                    earlier, the owner of 70 Belmont Road from 1977, <em>viz</em>, Tsang, was holding a conveyance which had conveyed the
                    right of way over plot B to him, but he also chose to do nothing about
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Extinguishment of easement by operation of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We next deal with the arguments of counsel for
                    the Appellant on the extinguishment of the right of way over plot B. He
                    referred to the judgment of this court in <em>Lee Tat Development
                        Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301</em>
                    [2009] 1 SLR(R) 875. Counsel argued that there were good policy
                    reasons for deciding that the right of way had been extinguished by operation of
                    law as the fact that it had not been used at all for more than 35 years, without
                    any protest or action of any sort by the dominant owner, must raise a question
                    mark as to whether the easement continued to accommodate the dominant tenement
                    in the manner as originally intended (see <em>Re Ellenborough
                        Park</em> [1956] Ch 131).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In our view, it is not necessary for us to
                    justify our decision on this ground. We were satisfied that the easement had
                    been abandoned by the time the Appellant purchased 72 Belmont Road in 1994
                    and certainly by the time the Respondents purchased 70 Belmont Road in
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Although not relevant to our determination, we
                    would add that from the point of view of equity and fairness, the Respondents
                    should have no complaints. They purchased 70 Belmont Road for a
                    consideration which, on the face of it, did not include any right of enjoyment
                    over plot B as a right of way to gain access to Belmont Road. On the other
                    hand, the Appellant purchased 72 Belmont Road for a consideration that, on
                    the face of it, included plot B without any visible right of way over it.
                    It could be said for both parties that, in terms of commercial value, each of
                    them got what they had paid for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For the reasons given above, we allowed the
                    appeal, with each party bearing his/their costs both here and
                below.</p>
