<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       From around the middle of 2012, the plaintiffs
                    Boon Lay Choo and Law Khim Huat (“the Plaintiffs”) were looking to
                    purchase landed property. They approached their banker at United Overseas Bank
                    (“the Bank”), one Leslie Ong (“Ong”), about the
                    financing of such a purchase, and on 12 July 2012, they were granted
                    in-principle approval for a loan by the Bank. The maximum quantum of this loan
                    would be capped at the prevailing loan-to-value ratio of 80%<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> imposed by MAS Notice
                    632 for purchasers in the Plaintiffs’ position. MAS Notice 632 is a notice
                    prescribed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“the MAS”)
                    pursuant to s 55 of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Banking
                    Act”) to banks for the purposes of regulating residential property loans.
                    The term “value” is defined as the market value or the net
                    purchase price of the residential property sought to be purchased, whichever is
                        lower.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 5 October 2012, the MAS issued an amendment
                    to MAS Notice 632 (the amended MAS Notice 632 is hereafter referred to as
                    “the 5 October Notice”). The press release accompanying the 5
                    October Notice explained that this was “part of the Government’s
                    broader aim of avoiding a price bubble and fostering long term stability in the
                    property market”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The 5 October
                    Notice, addressed to banks, provided, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that from 6 October 2012, for purchasers in the Plaintiffs’ position, the
                    loan-to-value ratio would be capped at 60% if the tenure of the facility sought
                    exceeded 30 years or if the sum of the tenure and the age of the borrower at the
                    time applying for the loan facility exceeded 65.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This represented a tightening of the
                    permissible loan-to-value ratio from 80% previously.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 10 October 2012, the Plaintiffs made a verbal
                    offer to the defendant Ting Siew May (“the Defendant”) to purchase
                    a property owned by her known as 30 Jalan Angin Laut Singapore 489226
                    (“the Property”). On 12 October 2012, almost a week after the new
                    restrictions imposed by the 5 October Notice were imposed, an agreement was
                    reached between the parties on the purchase price of $3.68 million.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Plaintiffs, they were advised by Ong to ask their property agent to check with
                    the Defendant if she was willing to date the option to purchase as 4 October
                    2012 instead of the actual date when the Defendant was to sign it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> They thought that if
                    the Option to Purchase was dated prior to 5 October 2012, they would be able to
                    obtain financing for the purchase on the more favourable terms allowed prior to
                    the issue of the 5 October Notice. This was because the tenure of the loan they
                    sought to obtain was 24 years,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> which when added together with the
                    Plaintiffs’ ages exceeded 65 years, and banks were accordingly allowed to
                    grant the Plaintiffs a loan at a loan-to-value ratio of up to 60% instead of
                        80%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiffs also
                    deposed that Ong had told them that “a lot of buyers” were
                    backdating their purchases to dates prior to 5 October 2012 for that
                        reason<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    and that it was simply “common practice” to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> On 13 October 2012, an option to
                    purchase was signed by the Defendant and was dated 4 October 2012 (“the
                    Option to Purchase”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> An option fee of $36,800,
                    being 1% of the purchase price, was paid by the Plaintiffs to the Defendant by
                    way of a cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Defendant’s evidence was that she was
                    abroad when the draft of the Option to Purchase was sent to her by her estate
                    agent, Ryan Liew (“Liew”), for her signature and she did not know
                    why 4 October 2012 had been typed into the draft as the date of the Option to
                        Purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> She said that when
                    she signed the Option to Purchase on 13 October 2012, her son, who was with her
                    at that time, did not sign as a witness in the relevant signature block of the
                    document because he wanted an explanation from Liew on the date stated in it.
                    She said that she did not agree to such backdating.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> On her son’s return to Singapore
                    on 15 October 2012, he was informed by Liew that the backdating was to
                    “facilitate” the obtaining of a loan by the buyer and that it was
                    common practice and there was nothing wrong in doing so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Her evidence was that her son in good
                    faith accepted Liew’s explanation and handed over the signed Option to
                    Purchase in exchange for the cheque from the Plaintiffs. It would appear that
                    Liew subsequently signed as a witness to the Defendant’s signature in the
                    Option to Purchase. According to the Defendant, it was only on 19 October 2012
                    that she and her son learned about the 5 October Notice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The Defendant was advised by her son
                    that to have backdated the Option to Purchase was illegal and that she should
                    not proceed with the sale of the property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Option to Purchase provided that it was to
                    expire “at 4:00pm on the 25th day of October 2012”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> On 24 October 2012, one day before
                    the expiry of the Option to Purchase, the Defendant’s solicitors wrote a
                    letter to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors stating that the backdating of the
                    Option to Purchase to 4 October 2012 in order to enable the Plaintiffs to obtain
                    a bank loan in contravention of the 5 October Notice was an “illegality
                    or irregularity”, and that the Defendant did not want to be a party to
                        it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> They said that they had instructions
                    to reject any exercise of the Option to Purchase. On the same day, the
                    Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote two letters to the Defendant’s
                    solicitors informing them that the Plaintiffs had the right to proceed with the
                    exercise of the Option to Purchase, and informing them that if the Defendant
                    refused to accept such exercise, she would be sued for damages for any loss
                    suffered by the Plaintiffs as a result of penalties imposed by their bank for
                    not proceeding with taking the loan that had already been approved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> On 25 October 2012, the
                    Plaintiffs’ solicitors attempted to exercise the Option to Purchase at the
                    offices of the Defendant’s solicitors. This was rejected by the latter.
                    There was a series of correspondence between the parties’ solicitors which
                    followed. Among other things, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors, in a letter
                    dated 6 December 2012, proposed performing the contract on the basis that it was
                    dated 13 October 2012, the actual date of signature of the Option by the
                    Defendant, and that they would obtain bank financing on that basis in accordance
                    with the 5 October Notice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> However, no resolution was
                    reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Originating Summons No 27 of 2013, the present
                    application before me, was brought by the Plaintiffs on 11 January 2013
                    for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that the Option to
                        Purchase is valid and binding on the Defendant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     an order for specific performance by
                        the Defendant of the Option to Purchase or, in the alternative,
                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s contention of illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was the Defendant’s case that because
                    the Plaintiffs backdated the Option to Purchase for an illegal purpose, namely,
                    to obtain a loan at an 80% loan-to-value ratio in contravention of the 5 October
                    Notice, the Option to Purchase was an illegal contract and was therefore
                    unenforceable. The Defendant further contended that because of the alleged
                    illegality, the Plaintiffs were approaching the court with “unclean
                    hands” and were therefore not entitled to an order of specific
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiffs did not deny that the Option to
                    Purchase was backdated in order to obtain the better loan terms but contended
                    that this did not make the Option to Purchase unenforceable. Further, they
                    argued that their hands were not unclean or that even if they were, they had
                    “washed them” prior to coming to the court for relief by agreeing
                    to perform the contract as though it had not been backdated by obtaining
                    financing from the Bank under the conditions stipulated in the 5 October
                    Notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the contract illegal or contrary to public policy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The unenforceability of contracts for illegality
                    or public policy is often regarded as a facet of the maxims “<em>ex dolo malo non oritur actio</em>” and
                        “<em>ex turpi causa non oritur
                    actio</em>”. The courts are asked to refuse to enforce contracts
                    which are otherwise validly formed, in order to give effect to the principle
                    that in certain circumstances, the broader objectives of the greater public good
                    override the parties’ otherwise legitimate contractual rights. Where the
                    balance is to be struck between public and private interests is often not a
                    straightforward exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     What was the alleged illegality in the present
                    case? According to the Defendant, the 5 October Notice was issued by the MAS
                    pursuant to its power under s 55 of the Banking Act to give directions or impose
                    requirements on or relating to the operations or activities of banks and s 71 of
                    the Act provided that a bank which acted in contravention of a s 55 notice is
                    subject to the penalty of a fine not exceeding $100,000, and in a case of a
                    continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day during
                    which the offence continued after conviction. The Defendant contended that this
                    constituted the statutory backdrop against which it could be said that the
                    backdating of the Option to Purchase to avoid the consequences of the 5 October
                    Notice was an attempt to contravene the law, and it rendered the Option to
                    Purchase unenforceable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    The Defendant also argued that the backdating was an act of deception on the
                        MAS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defendant did not, in my view, define the
                    alleged illegality with sufficient precision. From a perusal of the affidavits
                    before me, it would appear that either or both parties could be said to have
                    engaged in illegal conduct in two possible ways. First, on the faith of being
                    shown the Option to Purchase which was dated 4 October 2012 rather than its
                    actual date, the Bank offered the Plaintiffs a loan facility at an 80%
                    loan-to-value ratio which was promptly accepted by them on 19 October
                        2012,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and this
                    was something the Bank would not otherwise have done but for the backdating. In
                    other words, the act of deception was on the Bank, rather than MAS and the act
                    of backdating by either or both parties could be viewed as abetting such a
                    deception. Secondly, the Bank itself could <em>possibly</em> be in breach of the 5 October Notice by providing the
                    loan facility and accordingly would have committed an offence under s 55 of the
                    Banking Act punishable under s 71 and the act of backdating was an abetment by
                    either or both parties of such an offence by the Bank. I need to emphasise,
                    however, that this analysis has been based solely upon the assertions made and
                    the evidence adduced by the two parties to this action and should not be taken
                    as a determination of the liability of the Bank, which was not a party and did
                    not have the opportunity to put its version of events to the
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I will not undertake a comprehensive review of
                    the relevant jurisprudence on unenforceability of contracts for illegality or
                    public policy. I note that broadly speaking, the leading writers organise the
                    cases into two categories: those involving statutory illegality and those
                    involving illegality at common law founded on the concept of public policy. It
                    will therefore be on these two bases that I consider whether the Option to
                    Purchase in the present case is a contract which will not be enforced by this
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statutory illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The mere existence of a contravention of a
                    statutory provision does not automatically result in the adverse consequence of
                    the contract being rendered unenforceable. The question to ask is whether, on a
                    proper construction of the statute in question, it was the legislature’s
                    intention that, on account of the contravention, the contract in question should
                    be prohibited. In the most obvious of cases, a statute may expressly prohibit
                    the contract by declaring it illegal. In most cases, however, such prohibition,
                    if any, will be implied rather than express, and it is incumbent on the court to
                    ascertain if it was the legislature’s intention that over and above
                    proscribing the conduct in question, the contract should also be prohibited. As
                    succinctly framed by Devlin J in <em>St John Shipping Corp v
                        Joseph Rank Ltd</em> [1957] 1 QB 267 (“<em>St
                        John Shipping</em>”) at 287:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fundamental question is <em>whether the statute means
                            to prohibit the contract</em>. The statute is to be construed in
                        the ordinary way; one must have regard to all relevant considerations and no
                        single consideration, however important, is conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two questions are involved. The first... is: does the statute mean to
                        prohibit contracts at all? But if this be answered in the affirmative, then
                        one must ask: does this contract belong to the class which the statute
                        intends to prohibit?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the words of Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) in <em>Hemlata Pathela (trading as Coco Properties) v Suresh Partabrai and
                        another</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 393 at [10], the exercise is one of
                    gauging “the parliamentary pulse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As I have noted, the statutory contravention
                    in the present case would be an abetment of the Bank’s possible breach of
                    s 55 of the Banking Act when it committed itself to giving a loan to the
                    Plaintiffs at an 80% loan-to-value ratio (see above at [11]). What I then need
                    to determine is whether it was the legislature’s intention in enacting
                    this provision in the Banking Act to prohibit contracts such as the present
                    Option to Purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There is no express provision in the Banking
                    Act or its subsidiary legislation that loan agreements, let alone options to
                    purchase property for which such loan agreements are taken out, are invalidated
                    by virtue of a contravention of a s 55 notice. As to whether there is an implied
                    parliamentary intention to that effect, I note that the Banking Act deals with
                    the regulation of banks and s 55 empowers the MAS to issue notices to banks. Any
                    prohibition imposed by such notices under s 55 is therefore a prohibition
                    imposed on “banks” within the meaning of the Act and not the
                    general public at large. The 5 October Notice is a case in point as is apparent
                    from the words of the applicable para 2 which provides that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    
              <b><em>A bank shall not</em></b> grant –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    any credit facility for the purchase of
                                Residential Property to a Borrower...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">in certain specified circumstances. Further, the penalties imposed
                    under s 71 of the Banking Act for contraventions of s 55 are only imposed on
                    banks. It should also be noted that the 5 October Notice was directed at loans
                    which banks could give to their customers. The only reference in the 5 October
                    Notice to “options to purchase” is to define by date the property
                    transactions which would be subject to the new loan-to-value limits.
                    Accordingly, as the Plaintiffs pointed out to me, if any contract is to be
                    impliedly prohibited by the statutory scheme, it would be the loan agreement
                    between the Bank and its customer. It would require far more cogent evidence to
                    establish that Parliament intended by implication that the prohibition would
                    cover agreements entered into by two private parties which were separate from
                    but merely related to the loan agreement and to which the Bank was a total
                    stranger. I am accordingly not persuaded that there was any express or implied
                    legislative intention that the act of backdating the Option to Purchase to
                    enable the Plaintiffs to obtain a loan beyond the limits which the Bank could
                    give would render the Option to Purchase unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The writings in this area traditionally also
                    draw a distinction between contracts illegal as formed and illegal as performed
                    although in the view of the learned author in <em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy
                    Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em>”) at paras 13.042–13.043, such a
                    distinction is “unhelpful”. Be that as it may, could it be said
                    that although the Option to Purchase itself is not prohibited by the statutory
                    provisions, the Plaintiffs intended, in the performance of it, to act contrary
                    to statutory provisions, and so the contract ought not to be enforced? I do not
                    find that to be so. First, it is not apparent that the parties’
                    <em>performance</em> of any contractual obligation pursuant
                    to the Option to Purchase would contravene the law. The illegality was in the
                    backdating of the contract, and not its performance. Secondly, in analysing the
                    relevant cases, Devlin J in <em>St John Shipping</em> (at
                    284–286) explained that it was not the illegal manner of performance which
                    renders a contract unenforceable, but rather, a contract may be rendered
                    unenforceable where the performance of it “turned” it into a
                    contract prohibited by statute (at 284):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When fully considered, it is plain that [the previous cases] do not
                        proceed on the basis that in the course of performing a legal contract an
                        illegality was committed; but on the narrower basis that <em>the way in which the contract was performed turned it into the sort of
                            contract that was prohibited by the statute</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Devlin J went on to note (at 289):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the statutes to which the principle has been applied, what was
                        prohibited was a contract which had at its centre – indeed often
                        filling the whole space within its circumference – the prohibited
                        act...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, it must be remembered that the Option to Purchase
                    in question is a contract which concerned a sale and purchase of land and its
                    grant and exercise were, in and of themselves, perfectly legal. The illegal (if
                    at all) manner in which the financing of the sale and purchase was intended to
                    be procured by the Plaintiffs was a matter only merely incidental to the
                    contract and so cannot be said to transform it into a contract prohibited by
                    statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Even if performance of the contract did not
                    involve a breach of a statutory provision, is there a more general proposition
                    that if at least the Plaintiffs in this case entered into the contract with the
                        <em>intent</em> of abetting such a breach, this would
                    render the contract unenforceable by them? <em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em> (at para 13.051) refers to another
                        <em>dictum</em> of Devlin J in <em>St
                        John Shipping</em> (at 283) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] contract which is entered into with the object of committing an
                        illegal act is unenforceable. The application of this principle depends upon
                        proof of the intent, at the time the contract was made, to break the law; if
                        the intent is mutual the contract is not enforceable at all, and, if
                        unilateral, it is unenforceable at the suit of the party who is proved to
                        have it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From this passage, the textbook suggests (at paras 13.052 and 13.055)
                    that even where the contract in question is not expressly or implied prohibited
                    by statute, a party cannot seek enforcement of it where he entered into it with
                    the intention of contravening the statute and that this would be in position in
                    Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I will proceed on the basis that no
                    distinction is to be drawn in this regard between contracts entered into with
                    the intention to commit a statutory breach and contracts entered into with the
                    intention to <em>abet</em> such a breach. It is not evident
                    to me that the observations made in <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> I referred to envisage a <em>fixed</em> rule that any intention of a party at the outset of a
                    contract to do something prohibited by a statute, however serious or however
                    incidental, would automatically render the contract unenforceable at his suit.
                    Toulson LJ in the English Court of Appeal in <em>ParkingEye Ltd v
                        Somerfield Stores Ltd</em> [2013] 2 WLR 939 (“<em>ParkingEye</em>”) at [63], in analysing this part of
                    Devlin J’s judgment in <em>St John Shipping</em>,
                    observed that, when Devlin J’s judgment was read as a whole, it was
                    apparent that there was no such <em>fixed</em> rule.
                    Toulson LJ observed from the other parts of Devlin J’s judgment that even
                    Devlin J himself recognised that any such fixed rule had the potential of
                    leading to peculiar results, and concluded (at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When Devlin J’s judgment is read as a whole his reasoning is
                        characteristically subtle and cogent. To draw from it a fixed rule that any
                        intention from the outset to do something in the performance of the contract
                        which would in fact be illegal must vitiate any claim by the party concerned
                        does not do justice to his judgment. It is too crude and capable of giving
                        rise to injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Professor M P Furmston (“Prof
                    Furmston”) in M P Furmston, <em>The Analysis of Illegal
                        Contracts</em> (1966) 16 UTLJ 267 at 280 discussed the category of
                    cases where there is an agreement to commit a crime, and observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yet it is probable that even in this class the Court must exercise some
                        element of decision. It is not clear that because X is a crime, the contract
                        is necessarily illegal. The general principle stated in the books that an
                        agreement to commit a crime is illegal is based on cases where the crime was
                        a serious one and here the principle is clearly sound. The policy
                        considerations are much less clear where the crime involves only a venial
                        infraction of a minor statutory requirement. Here to hold the contract
                        illegal may be to impose a penalty very greatly in excess of any fault.
                        Suppose, for instance, a contract is made to carry goods by road and the
                        parties know that the goods can only be delivered by a short period of
                        illegal parking. It seems very doubtful whether public policy really
                        requires the carrier to be deprived of his freight and it is even more
                        doubtful whether he should be discharged from any liability for negligence
                        on the ground that the contract is illegal. Certainly if the contract is to
                        be held illegal, it should not be simply because improper parking is a crime
                        but because of a deliberate assessment of the overriding importance of
                        controlling parking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Among other things, Prof Furmston opined that the court must draw
                    distinctions between different sorts of statutory contraventions in coming to a
                    conclusion as to whether the contract in question should be held unenforceable.
                    As Prof Furmston suggests (at 283), it is in the end analysis a “delicate
                    problem of balancing the desirability of deterring crime against that of
                    upholding agreements” and that “some measure of flexibility seems
                    essential to reach a satisfactory result in this type of
                    situation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In any case, the proposition that a party
                    cannot enforce a contract he or she entered into with the <em>intent</em> of contravening a statute does not appear to be one which
                    belongs to the realm of statutory illegality (as explained above at [13]).
                    First, Devlin J’s remarks applied to illegality without any distinction
                    being drawn between statutory and common law illegality. Secondly, even if the
                    illegal act was prohibited by statute, the analysis in this instance does not
                    involve an ascertainment of either an express or implied Parliamentary intent in
                    enacting that legislation. The proposition, to the extent to it exists, would in
                    my view more properly be regarded as an aspect of common law illegality where
                    the courts as a matter of public policy will refuse to enforce contracts tainted
                    with illegality in certain circumstances. Among them are contracts to commit a
                    crime, tort or fraud. But, as I will explain below, the refusal to enforce such
                    contracts is not an inflexible rule. A court may still enforce a contract
                    involving the contravention of a statute if the illegality is sufficiently
                    remote or if there is no need for the enforcing party to rely on the illegality
                    for the purposes of enforcement (see below, especially at [26]–[27] and
                    [28]–[29] respectively). As a matter of logic, the same exceptions of
                    remoteness and non-reliance on the illegality would have to apply whether one is
                    confronted with a contract to commit a crime as such or a contract entered into
                    with the intent that a statute will be contravened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Professor R A Buckley (“Prof
                    Buckley”) in R A Buckley, <em>Illegality and Public
                        Policy</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) at para 2.06, in his
                    commentary on the case of <em>Shaw v Groom</em> [1970] 2 QB
                    504, suggests that the courts may render contracts unenforceable in order to
                    give effect to the objectives of a statute without necessarily finding either an
                    express or implied legislative intent as such. In <em>Shaw v
                        Groom</em>, a landlord suing for rent was met with a defence of
                    illegality raised by the tenant on the basis that the landlord had failed to
                    supply a rent book as required by the statutory regulations in force, <em>viz</em>, the Rent Book (Forms of Notice) Regulations 1965.
                    The English Court of Appeal held that on a true construction of the legislation,
                    Parliament had not intended that the landlord be precluded from enforcing the
                    contract. In the judgment of Sachs LJ (at 519D), it was highlighted that there
                    was “not the slightest suggestion” that the landlord’s
                    breach of the regulations was “knowingly or wilfully committed”.
                    Prof Buckley (at para 2.06), noted that while this suggests that had the breach
                    been deliberate, the result would have been different and the contract would
                    have been held unenforceable, an analysis of Sachs LJ’s statement only
                    indicates that there are cases where “[i]t may well... be appropriate for
                    the law of contract to discourage the anti-social conduct at which the statute
                    is directed, without necessarily ascribing that result to the statute
                    itself”. A type of case envisaged by Prof Buckley, is one where, for
                    example, there is a “combination of high potential profits, and fines
                    that may have become absurdly low” such that there creates an
                    “incentive to law-breaking”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defendant submitted that to uphold the
                    present Option to Purchase would be to approve such deliberate acts of
                    backdating among property buyers in the general market, and urged me to declare
                    it unenforceable as a form of deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I agree with Prof Buckley’s observations
                    that there may be circumstances where the courts will refuse enforcement in
                    order to deter conduct proscribed by the statute. I note in passing that Prof
                    Buckley’s analysis is premised on the intention of the contracting party
                    to contravene a statute being <em>a</em> relevant fact in
                    determining unenforceability and is not in and of itself conclusive of that
                    outcome. But I am not persuaded that the Option to Purchase in the present case
                    should be rendered unenforceable on these considerations. Apart from the
                    Plaintiffs’ statement that they were told by Ong that there was a
                    “common practice” in the market of backdating purchase dates to
                    avoid the new loan regulations, and the evidence that the Defendant’s son
                    was told the same by Liew, there was no evidence put before me of how widespread
                    such a practice was. This statement was, in any event, hearsay. Nor was there
                    any evidence or submissions as to whether the existing sanctions, including
                    those under s 71, were adequate and if not, whether it was then necessary for
                    the civil court to intervene and whether such intervention had to extend to
                    rendering not only the actual loan agreements unenforceable, but also the
                    associated options to purchase as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality at common law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Illegality at common law is founded on the
                    concept of public policy which is more fluid and harder to define. There are
                    however two established situations of illegality at common law which are
                    pertinent to the present case – contracts to deceive the public
                    authorities and contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendant argued that the backdating was
                    an act of deception such that the Option to Purchase ought <em>ipso facto</em> to be declared unenforceable<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> and emphasised that the 5
                    October Notice was one made in and for the public interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I understood the
                    Defendant’s argument to be that a deception performed in the context of a
                    matter affecting the public interest should lead to the Option to Purchase being
                    unenforceable. I am not persuaded by this argument. First, any deception in the
                    present case is not on the MAS, but on the Bank, which is a private entity.
                    Although it might be argued that the Bank performs some functions of a
                    quasi-public nature, there is nothing to suggest that the head of public policy
                    covering the deception of public authorities ought to be expanded beyond public
                    authorities to privately owned banks or other entities (<em>cf</em> the Malaysian Federal Court decision in <em>Theresa Chong v Kin Khoon &amp; Co</em> [1976] 2 MLJ 253). Secondly,
                    and more importantly, the case law is clear that there is no automatic rule
                    against enforcement of a contract merely because it is one which involves an
                    illegality and this is regardless of whether the illegality takes the form of a
                    deception of public authorities or the commission of a crime, tort or
                    fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I referred earlier to Toulson LJ’s
                    remarks in <em>ParkingEye</em> in which he refused to
                    interpret Devlin J’s <em>dictum</em> in <em>St John Shipping</em> as laying down an inflexible rule that
                    a contract entered into with the intention to do something illegal rendered it
                    unenforceable. Among the relevant factors which Toulson LJ considered in the
                    final disposal of the matter, <em>viz</em>, in determining
                    whether enforcement should be refused, was the “centrality of the
                    illegality” (at [69] <em>et seq</em>). The case
                    involved a contract to provide an automated monitoring and control system to
                    some of the car parks owned or operated by the defendant Somerfield Stores Ltd.
                    Somerfield Stores Ltd committed a repudiatory breach which was accepted by the
                    claimant ParkingEye Ltd, who then sued for damages for lost revenue. The
                    defendant raised illegality as a defence. It referred to letters which the
                    claimant would send to recover “fines” from motorists who had
                    defaulted on parking charges. Some of these letters falsely suggested that the
                    claimant had the authority to and was intending to commence legal proceedings to
                    recover the parking charges. The sending of the letters was held by the trial
                    judge to have amounted to the tort of deceit. However, he found that the sending
                    of the illegal letters was not one of the purposes of the contract, the most
                    important of which was the installation of the system in car parks. He therefore
                    concluded that any illegality was too remote to render the agreement
                    unenforceable. On appeal, Sir Robin Jacob (at [34]) and Toulson LJ (at [71])
                    agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The centrality or degree of remoteness of any
                    illegality as a consideration also featured in the English decision of <em>21st Century Logistic Solution v Madysen</em> [2004] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 92 (“<em>Madysen</em>”)
                    which the Plaintiffs pointed me to. In that case, Field J in the High Court held
                    that the fact that the supplier of computer processor units intended to defraud
                    the revenue authorities was not a bar to it recovering the purchase price of the
                    goods. The existence of the contract of sale provided the opportunity to the
                    supplier to commit the fraud on the revenue authorities, but that was not
                    something which it had done, since it was only obliged to account to the customs
                    and excise authorities at the end of the relevant accounting period. It was held
                    (at [21]) that the supplier’s fraudulent intention was too remote from the
                    contract to render it unenforceable. The contract was in the words of Field J
                    (at [19]), “in and of itself” a lawful contract for the sale and
                    purchase of goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In her submissions, the Defendant referred me
                    to the Singapore case of <em>American Home Assurance Co v Hong
                        Lam Marine Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992 (“<em>Hong Lam Marine</em>”) at [67] for the proposition
                    that the backdating of a contract for an illegal purpose (of deception) renders
                    the contract unenforceable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> What the Defendant
                    appeared to overlook was the fact that in <em>Hong Lam
                        Marine</em>, the backdating of a shipbuilding agreement, though
                    illegal, was held by the Singapore Court of Appeal not to be a bar to its
                    enforcement. Yong Pung How CJ, delivering the judgment of the court,
                    distinguished the earlier cases of <em>Suntoso Jacob v Kong Miao
                        Ming</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 524, <em>Alexander v
                        Rayson</em> [1936] 1 KB 169 and <em>Palaniappa Chettier
                        v Arunasalam Chettier</em> [1962] MLJ 143. Yong CJ held, <em>inter alia</em>, that in those three cases, the claimants had
                    to reveal the illegal purpose in seeking the assistance of the courts to enforce
                    the contract. In contrast, the claimants in <em>Hong Lam
                        Marine</em> did not need to rely on the backdating to found their
                    claim for the breach of a specific term in the shipbuilding contract. Yong CJ
                    explained (at [67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, in contrast, the respondents did not need to rely on
                        the backdating in order to succeed in their counterclaim against the
                        shipyard. <em>It was not necessary for them to found their
                            claim against the shipyard as the owners of a Singapore-registered ship,
                            as their cause of action was based on the delay in the delivery of the
                            vessel in breach of a specific term of the shipbuilding
                            agreement</em>. If they had to go behind the backdating to prove
                        the actual date of the shipbuilding agreement in order to succeed in their
                        claim, or if their claim was dependent on the status of the vessel as a
                        Singapore-registered ship, the cases cited by the shipyard (<em>viz Suntoso Jacob</em>, <em>Alexander v
                            Rayson</em> and <em>Palaniappa Chettiar</em>)
                        might be relevant and applicable since the respondents would be basing their
                        claim on a state of affairs which was obtained through a deception on the
                        Registrar. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This principle has been described as the
                    “reliance principle” (see, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <em>Relief from Unenforceability of Illegal Contracts and
                        Trusts</em> (5 July 2002) at paras 7.2–7.6 and The Law
                    Commission of England and Wales, <em>Illegal Transactions: The
                        Effect of Illegality on Contracts and Trusts</em> (Consultation Paper
                    No 154, 1999) at paras 2.64–2.67), and is often traced to the case of
                        <em>Bowmakers Ltd v Barnet Instruments Ltd</em> [1945]
                    1 KB 65 (“<em>Bowmakers</em>”). In <em>Bowmakers</em>, the plaintiff had delivered machine tools
                    under hire purchase agreements to the defendants in contravention of an order
                    made by the Minister under the UK Defence (General) Regulations 1939. The
                    defendants defaulted on the hire purchase agreements and sold the tools which
                    were the subject of two of the agreements to a third party, and refused to
                    redeliver the tools under the last agreement. The plaintiff sued in conversion
                    and the court allowed the recovery of damages notwithstanding the illegality of
                    the hire purchase transactions themselves. The case established the principle
                    that where a party can seek recovery via an independent cause of action which
                    does not require him to rely on the illegality, recovery will be
                allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The reliance principle was subsequently
                    reaffirmed by the House of Lords in <em>Tinsley v
                        Milligan</em> [1994] 1 AC 340. In that case, the plaintiff and the
                    defendant, a lesbian couple, had pooled their monies together to purchase a
                    house. However, the house was registered in the name of only the plaintiff, and
                    this was so to enable the defendant to make false benefit claims on the UK
                    Department of Social Security. When the parties fell out, the plaintiff sought
                    to claim sole possession and ownership over the house. The defendant
                    counterclaimed for a declaration that the house was held by the plaintiff in
                    trust for the parties in equal shares. The counterclaim was allowed. The House
                    held that a presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of the defendant, and
                    that this was not affected by the illegality because she did not have to rely on
                    the illegal transaction to establish this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Although the reliance principle as derived
                    from <em>Bowmakers</em> and <em>Tinsley v
                        Milligan</em> was applied in those cases in relation to the assertion
                    of proprietary rights, Quentin Loh J in the High Court in <em>Lim
                        Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd and another</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 657 at [204] observed, on the basis of the Court of Appeal
                    decisions in <em>Hong Lam Marine</em> and <em>Siow Soon Kim v Lim Eng Beng</em> [2004] SGCA 4
                        (“<em>Siow Soon Kim</em>”) that the
                    principle has found general application. I note that, in contrast, an earlier
                    High Court decision in <em>Chee Jok Heng Stephanie v Chang Yue
                        Shoon</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1131 at [42] preferred the narrower
                    interpretation that it was applicable only in relation to proprietary rights.
                    Given that the two Singapore Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Hong Lam Marine</em> and <em>Siow Soon Kim</em>
                    applied the reliance principle outside the sphere of proprietary rights, I too
                    accept that it is, as a matter of Singapore jurisprudence, a principle of
                    general application and it is applicable to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     There is a significant degree of overlap
                    between (a) the centrality or degree of remoteness of the illegality and (b) the
                    reliance principle in determining whether the illegality renders a contract
                    unenforceable. While <em>ParkingEye</em> and <em>Madysen</em> (see above at [26] and [27] respectively)
                    adopted the former approach, it would, on the facts in both cases, also have
                    been unnecessary to rely on the illegality to establish the claims. Similarly,
                    it is possible to regard the extent to which reliance on the illegality is
                    required to establish the claim as one aspect of determining if the illegality
                    is too remote for the court to deny enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, regardless of which
                    principle is applied, the illegality is not an obstacle to enforcement. As
                    regards remoteness, there was no illegality <em>per se</em>
                    in the grant and exercise of the Option to Purchase. The illegal manner in which
                    the financing was intended to be procured by the Plaintiffs was a matter which
                    was merely incidental to the contract constituted by the Option to Purchase and
                    is therefore too remote to render the Option to Purchase unenforceable. As
                    regards the reliance principle, there is similarly no need in the present case
                    for the Plaintiffs to rely on the backdating to found their claim against the
                    Defendant. Although the Option to Purchase had a date printed on it which was
                    not the actual date of the agreement, that was not something the Plaintiffs had
                    to point to in seeking to enforce it. This was not a case where the Option to
                    Purchase provided that it was to expire within a stipulated timeframe from the
                    date of the agreement, and there was a dispute as to when it expired which
                    required the Plaintiffs to explain why it was dated 4 October 2012 and not the
                    actual date of 13 October 2012. The Option to Purchase expressly set out instead
                    a specific date and time for its expiry, namely “at 4:00pm on the 25th
                    day of October 2012”, which was not determined by reference to the date
                    of its signature.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I should add that the decision in <em>Hong Lam Marine</em> is also demonstrative of the fact that
                    Devlin J’s <em>dictum</em> in <em>St
                        John Shipping</em> (see above at [17]) cannot be regarded as
                    articulating an absolute rule that a contract entered into with intent to commit
                    a breach of a statutory provision will automatically be unenforceable. In
                        <em>Hong Lam Marine</em>, it was common ground that the
                    shipbuilding agreement was backdated with the intent to avoid compliance with
                    reg 13F of the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Regulations (at [63]). The
                    backdating could be regarded as an abetment of a breach of that regulation as
                    well as an abetment of a deception on the Registrar of Ships, in a manner
                    similar to the present case. But the outcome was one where the shipbuilding
                    contract was nevertheless held to enforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on illegality and public policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to
                    accept the Defendant’s assertion that the Option to Purchase is
                    unenforceable for illegality, whether that illegality is statutory or based on
                    common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The doctrine of <em>locus
                poenitentiae</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I would add a few words about the doctrine of
                        <em>locus poenitentiae</em> (<em>viz</em>, “a place for repentance”) in the context of
                    the present case. Before me, counsel also argued quite extensively over whether
                    the Plaintiffs could avail themselves of the <em>locus
                        poenitentiae</em> doctrine. The Plaintiffs argued that they had
                    “repented” from the illegality when they offered to seek financing
                    in accordance with the loan-to-value ceiling established by the 5 October
                    Notice. They argued that having brought themselves within the <em>locus poenitentiae</em>, the Option to Purchase was no longer illegal
                    and was thus enforceable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It would appear that counsel might not have
                    fully understood the operation of this doctrine. The doctrine, as understood in
                    this context, applies where a party is seeking to recover benefits (money or
                    property) conferred on the other party under an <em>illegal</em> contract (see the explanation of it in <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> at para 13.155 and
                    Nelson Enonchong, <em>Illegal Transactions</em> (LLP
                    Reference Publishing, 1998) at p 333). This would be relevant, for example, if
                    the Option to Purchase was held to be unenforceable, and the Plaintiffs were
                    seeking to recover the $36,800 option fee paid to the Defendant (as was the case
                    in <em>Aqua Art Pte Ltd v Goodman Development (S) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 865). The issue of whether a contract is legal
                    or illegal is therefore a logically anterior one. In the present case, I have
                    found that the contract is not unenforceable for illegality. Accordingly, the
                    issue of whether the Plaintiffs have brought themselves within the <em>locus poenitentiae</em> does not come into
                play.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Specific performance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In addition to arguing that the contract was
                    unenforceable for illegality, the Defendant also contended that the Plaintiffs
                    were not entitled to an order for specific performance for the same reason,
                        <em>viz</em>, the alleged illegality as discussed
                        above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The Defendant relied on the maxim ‘he
                    who comes to equity must come with clean hands’. But if a contract is not
                    void and not unenforceable at law, I can see no reason why it should
                    nevertheless not be specifically enforceable in equity. In this regard, Page
                    Wood VC in <em>Aubin v Holt</em> (1855) 2 K &amp; J 66 at
                    70 explained thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The agreement must be legal or illegal, and it is not within the
                        discretion of the Court to refuse specific performance because an agreement
                        savours of illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is especially so given that in Singapore, law and equity are
                    administered by the same courts, as they are in England today. It would be odd
                    if the court were, on the one hand, to reject arguments of illegality and find a
                    contract enforceable but, on the other, deny specific performance of it on the
                    basis of the very same arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Much time was also spent by counsel at the
                    hearings before me on the issue of whether the Plaintiffs, to use the evocative
                    language employed, had “washed their hands” before coming to the
                    court to seek relief in equity. As I have come to the conclusion that there is
                    no reason to deny the Plaintiffs an order for specific performance, I do not
                    need to make any findings in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I accordingly declare that the Option to
                    Purchase is valid and binding on the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Aside from the arguments on illegality which I
                    have rejected above, the Defendant did not dispute the Plaintiffs’
                    entitlement to the relief of specific performance in the present case. In any
                    event, this was not a case where, on the facts disclosed, the usual position
                    that an order for specific performance should be granted for contracts for the
                    sale of land should be departed from. In the premises, I order that the Option
                    to Purchase is to be specifically performed by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Costs are to follow the event and are to be
                    taxed if not agreed.</p>
