<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns="">1.  The plaintiffs, AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd (hereinafter referred to

as "AFM 2000"), contended that their former sales and handling agents for sea

freight, the defendants, Freight Links Express Ltd (hereinafter referred to as

"FLE"), caused them loss by wrongfully withholding their cargo and by failing

and/or refusing to carry out their contractual obligations to tranship or deliver cargo

forwarded to them. FLE denied having breached their contractual obligations and made a

counterclaim for the sum of US$635,165.30, which they claimed was owed to them by AFM

2000.</p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="center" xmlns="">A.  BACKGROUND</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.  Until August 2000, FLE and another company, AFS Freight

Management Pty Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "AFS") had an agency arrangement,

under which both companies agreed to act as exclusive agents for each other in sea freight

consolidation services between Australia and Singapore. AFS owed FLE more than S$1m for

services rendered under the agency arrangement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.  In early 2000, AFS wanted to sell their assets and goodwill.

Discussions were held with the New American Consolidators Association (hereinafter

referred to as "NACA") and it was finally agreed that Trident Logistics (Aust)

Pty Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Trident"), a company within the NACA

Group, would acquire the fixed assets and goodwill of the AFS Group. The acquisition,

which was concluded on 18 August 2000, did not involve the taking over of the AFS

Group’s debts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.  After the completion of the purchase, Trident incorporated a

new company, AFM 2000, to run the business of sea freight consolidation previously

conducted by AFS. This new company, which was keen to continue AFS’ business links

with FLE, proposed that a new agency agreement with FLE be signed. The agreement, which

was left with FLE, was never signed. However, it is pertinent to note that FLE adopted the

freight rates stipulated in the unsigned agreement in their dealings with AFM 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.  FLE asserted that the AFS representatives and NACA’s own

representatives represented to them that AFM 2000 would assume the massive debt

(hereinafter referred to as "the AFS debt") owed to them by the AFS group. They

contended that on the basis that AFM 2000 would be liable for the AFS debt, they did

business with AFM 2000. However, AFM 2000 asserted that it was made clear to FLE that

Trident had merely purchased the business assets of the AFS Group and that there was no

transfer of the liabilities and/or debts of the AFS Group.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.  In the early part of 2001, FLE realised that the AFS Group was

in liquidation. Relations between FLE and AFM 2000 took a turn for the worse. According to

AFM 2000, their customers started to complain from late February to March 2001 that

consignments that had been shipped with them, and which had been forwarded to FLE as far

back as January 2000, had not arrived at their intended final destination. AFM 2000

asserted that FLE’s unreasonable conduct exposed them to potential claims from their

customers. After paying FLE around US$41,000, which FLE claimed was owed to them for

services rendered, and a further sum under protest with respect to storage charges for the

detained goods, the goods in question were finally released.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center">B.  THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIM AGAINST FLE</p>
<p align="center">           FOR

WRONGFUL DETENTION OF CARGO</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.  AFM 2000’s claim against FLE centres around the

consequences of what they claimed was the wrongful detention of their cargo in the first

quarter of 2001. They asserted that whatever grouses FLE may have had against them, there

was no justification for the detention of the cargo forwarded to FLE under agreed agency

arrangements. AFM 2000 thus sought the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) a declaration that FLE acted in breach of contract when they

    detained the cargo in question;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) damages for breach of contract; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the refund of the sum paid by them under protest for storage

    charges for the detained cargo.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.  FLE initially contended that they were not in breach when they

detained AFM 2000’s cargo because they had not been paid for their services under the

agency arrangements with AFM 2000. However, FLE’s senior vice-president, Mr Alex Ng,

conceded during the trial that his company had acted without justification when they

detained the said cargo. When cross-examined and when he was questioned by me, he said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Q.        I put it to you that FLE

  had no basis to withhold cargo shipped to them by the plaintiffs

  in March        2001.  Do you agree?</p>
<p> A.        I agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">             

Ct.       You agree with the plaintiffs’ counsel that

what FLE did was wrong?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">              

A.       Yes.</p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.  When FLE’s counsel, Mr Francis Goh, gave him an

opportunity during re-examination to clarify his position, Mr Alex Ng reiterated that FLE

had no right to detain the cargo in question when he said as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">    Q.       It was put to

  you that you had no basis for withholding the cargo in March 2001. You said

  that          you agreed. Would you like to

  clarify the position</p>
<p align="justify">    A.       I stand by my

  earlier answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Whether or not Mr Ng conceded the point, there can be no doubt that

FLE’s detention of AFM 2000’s cargo cannot be justified. FLE admitted that they

gave AFM 2000 no notice whatsoever of their intention not to handle any more of the

latter’s goods. Mr Alex Ng said as follows during cross-examination:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>    Q.       Prior to taking action to

  withhold AFM 2000’s cargo, did FLE inform the latter that they would do so if no

  money was forthcoming?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<ol type="A" xmlns="">
<ol type="A">
<li>    No.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<ol start="17" type="A">
<li>    AFM 2000 would have assumed that you would deal with their cargo as

      you had always done?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<ol type="A" xmlns="">
<ol type="A">
<li>    Yes.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<ol start="17" type="A">
<li>    If you were going to hold their cargo, why did you not inform AFM

      2000 about that?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<ol type="A">
<li>    I am not certain about that.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns="">             

Q.     You are a senior management person representing your company at

this trial and yet you are unable to say why no warning was issued to AFM 2000 that you

would withhold their cargo? 

</p><ol start="17" type="A" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">    A.      I cannot comment on

  that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. I thus hold that FLE breached their contractual obligations when

they detained AFM 2000’s cargo. Damages will be assessed by the Registrar. AFM 2000

are also entitled to a refund of the storage charges paid by them to FLE under protest to

secure the release of their cargo and to costs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="center" xmlns="">C. FLE’S COUNTERCLAIM</p>
<p align="center" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. I now turn to FLE’s counterclaim, which relates to the

allegation that AFM 2000 is responsible for the AFS debt of more than S$1m. FLE’s

case, as pleaded, is that around August 2000, Mr Steve Reison, AFS’ managing director

and subsequently AFM 2000’s chief operating officer, represented to them that the

following terms will govern the future relationship between FLE and AFM 2000:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) AFM 2000 shall represent the AFS Group of Companies and FLE shall

    represent the Freight Links Group of Companies;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) AFM 2000 will be responsible for and settle the debts of the AFS

    companies; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) AFM 2000 will make payments promptly when due for all new business.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. FLE also asserted that in or about October 2000, two

representatives of NACA and AFM 2000, namely Mr Bob Hackett, AFM 2000’s managing

director, and Mr Pece Gorgievski, the then vice-president of business development in the

NACA Group, made the following representations to them:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    NACA were effectively the new owners of AFS;</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    NACA wanted FLE to continue as AFM 2000’s

    agents in Singapore;</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    NACA was aware of the substantial debts owed by

    AFS to them and AFM 2000 will be      responsible for settling

    the debts; and</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>          (d)    FLE will

  continue to work closely with Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. I have no hesitation in rejecting FLE’s assertion that AFM

2000 had agreed to be responsible for the AFS debt for a number of reasons. FLE’s

witnesses contradicted one another and their hesitant answers did not convince me that

their case rested on solid ground. To begin with, FLE’s evidence as to when the

alleged representations were made leaves much to be desired. Initially, they asserted that

they relied on representations made to them in July 2000 and that these representations

were subsequently repeated in writing. These assertions were contained in a letter from

their solicitors, Ari, Goh &amp; Partners, to AFM 2000’s solicitors, Drew &amp;

Napier LLC, on 23 March 2001. The relevant parts of this letter are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. The AFS companies, in the course of their dealings with our clients

    incurred total debts which presently amount to in excess of $1,000,000.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In about July 2000, it was intimated by Mr Steve Reison and Scott

    Bell, who are presently with your clients that there was a change of ownership in the AFS

    group and that Australian Freight Services Ltd was to be renamed … [AFM 2000] …

    to manage the operations of the group. Our clients were given at the point to understand

    that they were dealing in effect with the same parties and that the changes were in line

    with the reorganisation being effected within the group. These oral representations were

    subsequently followed up in writing.</p>
<p align="justify">4. It was further represented by Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell

    … [that AFM 2000] would continue to be responsible for the existing debts of the AFS

    companies ….</p>
<p align="justify">5. Our clients continued their business on the basis of the aforesaid.

    It transpired in about early March 2001 that the AFS companies were being placed under

    receivership …. Our clients have come to know that the AFS companies and [AFM 2000]

    are controlled by the same parties.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Our clients are by reason of the aforesaid facts entitled to lift

    the corporate veil vis--vis the aforesaid companies to show that they are owned and

    controlled by common parties. They will be making a claim against [AFM 2000] for the

    entirety of the sums due to them.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. A comparison of the contents of the above letter and FLE’s

pleaded case will reveal fundamental flaws in FLE’s position. Contrary to what was

asserted in Ari, Goh &amp; Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001, FLE conceded during the

trial that no representations were made in writing and no serious attempt was made during

the trial to pierce the corporate veil.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. Secondly, although Ari, Goh &amp; Partners’ letter of 23 March

2001 referred to representations that were made in July 2000, FLE’s Defence and

Counterclaim did not refer to any such representations. Instead, reliance was placed on

alleged representations made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by a NACA team in

October 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. A question arises as to why the alleged representations that were

allegedly made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by NACA’s representatives in

October 2000 were not referred to in Ari, Goh &amp; Partners’ letter of 23 March

2001. That the alleged representations by NACA’s representatives are important to

FLE’s case was conceded by Mr Alex Ng, FLE’s senior vice-president, who said as

follows during cross-examination:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. The understanding reached with NACA’s representatives in

    October 2000 is an important part   of FLE’s position that AFM 2000 had

    taken responsibility for payment of the AFS debt to FLE?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Yes….</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. Mr Ng could not shed any light as to why the important October 2000

meeting with NACA representatives and the August 2000 meeting with Mr Steve Reison were

not referred to in Ari, Goh &amp; Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001. When

cross-examined, he merely said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. Given that the entire basis of FLE’s claim is based on

    representations made in August and       October 2000, can

    you explain why no reference was made to those representations in this letter?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I have no explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. Apart from being unsure about when the misrepresentation of facts

was made, FLE was also unclear as to what had been allegedly misrepresented. FLE was

clutching at straws when they said that AFM 2000 must be taken to have assumed liability

for the AFS debt because they had been told that it was "business as usual" and

that after the formation of AFM 2000, Mr Steve Reison’s business card was similar to

that used by him when he was in AFS. The words "business as usual", if used,

must be read in their proper context. More importantly, FLE’s allegation that they

thought that it was "business as usual" because Mr Hackett had represented to

them in October 2000 that FLE could continue to work with AFS’ stalwarts, Mr Steve

Reison and Mr Scott Bell, cannot be believed. It is most unlikely that Mr Hackett would

have represented to FLE that Mr Bell would be working with FLE for the simple reason that

the latter did not join AFM 2000 or NACA. In any case, it is rather odd that after having

asserted that FLE felt reassured that they could continue to work with Mr Scott Bell,

FLE’s Mr Alex Ng denied any knowledge of the fact that Mr Bell was not part of the

AFM 2000 team. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. You were assured that FLE could work with Mr Steve Reison and Mr

    Scott Bell?</p>
<p align="justify">A. With both of them.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. How could that be when Mr Scott Bell did not join AFM 2000 or NACA?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I am not aware of that.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Did you ever deal with Mr Scott Bell after August 2000?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. In that case, you must have known that Mr Scott Bell had no role to

    play in the new company?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I am not aware of his specific role in AFM 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. It is important to note that Mr Alex Ng finally conceded that as

far as he was concerned, it was his own perception that AFM 2000 had assumed liability for

the AFS debt. When questioned by me, he said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ct.    Did Mr Reison tell you that AFM 2000 were going

    to pay the AFS debt?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">                   

A.     No.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ct.    Is it your own understanding that AFM 2000 will

    pay the AFS debt?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">                   

A.     Yes.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. Apart from the uncertainties regarding the time and nature of the

alleged representations made by AFM 2000, FLE did not act as if they really believed that

AFM 2000 were responsible for the AFS debt. From the time FLE commenced business with AFM

2000 in August 2000, no notice was served on AFM 2000 regarding the amount owed by AFS

until after AFS had gone into liquidation. Admittedly, Mr Lee Hock Seng, FLE’s

assistant vice-president, claimed that before Ari, Goh &amp; Partners’ letter of 23

March 2001 was sent to AFM 2000’s solicitors, FLE had informed AFM 2000 of the amount

owed by AFS. When cross-examined, he asserted as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. Do you have any documentary evidence that prior to the letter of

    2001, the plaintiffs were informed of the debt of the AFS Group?</p>
<p align="justify">A. There were letters from our financial controller.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Are any of these letters in evidence?</p>
<p align="justify">A. They are with our financial controller.</p>
<p align="justify">Q<i>. Is it your personal evidence that letters were sent to the

    plaintiffs, demanding payment of the debts of the AFS Group?</i></p>
<p align="justify">A<i>. Yes.</i></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">                   

(emphasis added)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. Mr Alex Ng also asserted that FLE had sent AFM 2000 monthly

statements with respect to the AFS debt. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>Q.    Is there any documentary evidence to show that before your lawyers

    wrote a letter of demand, FLE informed AFM 2000 of the amount owed by AFS?</p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>          A.    No, not

<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>Q.     I put it to you that no statement of accounts was sent to

    AFM 2000 with respect to the AFS debt because they did not assume AFS’ liability.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>           A.    We

<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. FLE’s financial controller, Mr Thomas Woo, contradicted Mr Lee

and Mr Ng. When cross-examined, he stated that he took no steps to inform AFM 2000 about

the AFS debt because "internal senior people assumed the responsibility of collecting

the debt". That no statement of accounts relating to the AFS debt was ever sent to

AFM 2000 is patently clear from the following position taken by Mr Woo during

cross-examination:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>Q.    From August 2000 until the matter became a legal problem, no

    demand was made to AFM 2000 for payment of this large debt of $1m.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">A. No demand was made.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. From August 2000 to March 2001, you never sent a notice of demand to

    AFM 2000 to show that they owed the debt of $1m?</p>
<p align="justify">A. No.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. Apart from not demanding from AFM 2000 the amount owed by AFS until

after the latter had gone into liquidation, FLE’s senior vice-president, Mr Alex Ng,

agreed with AFM 2000’s managing director, Mr Bob Hackett, in March 2001 that the

total amount owed by AFM 2000 to FLE was only around US$41,000. On 12 March 2001, Mr

Hackett wrote to Mr Ng as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I understand your position has been that AFS Freight Management 2000

    had owed FLE around USD41,000 and therefore had exceeded your credit limit, so that

    bookings were blocked by your system. Further, I understand that all you desire is that we

    pay each other what we owe, and move on. This is all we want as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. On 13 March 2001, Mr Ng replied to Mr Hackett as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">As you correctly said, our position has been that [AFM 2000] is owing

    [FLE] about US$41,000 plus, details of which have been given to you. If you are agreeable

    to this amount, please arrange to settle this urgently.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. Mr Ng made no reference whatsoever to the AFS debt when he stated

that FLE’s position has been that AFM 2000 owed FLE around US$41,000. AFM 2000 paid

the sum claimed by FLE even though they thought that the amount should have been a little

less. FLE is in no position now to say that the AFS debt was not included in Mr Ng’s

confirmation of the amount owed by AFM 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. If one looks at the whole picture squarely, much as AFM 2000 wanted

to have a business relationship with FLE, there was no reason for them to cripple

themselves by assuming liability for the AFS debt, which amounted to more than S$1m. In

paras 11-13 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Steve Reison, AFM 2000’s chief

operating officer and the man accused of having represented to FLE that the AFS debt would

be paid by the new company, stated as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">11. Immediately following the conclusion of the purchase of the AFS

    Group by Trident, AFS sent a written announcement out to all customers, vendors and

    agents, advising them of the changes arising from the purchase and how the accounting was

    to be treated….</p>
<p align="justify">12. The announcement made clear that notwithstanding the sale, all

    transactions prior to 31 July 2000 would remain the responsibility of AFS.</p>
<p align="justify">13. As the Defendants were agents of AFS, the fax announcement would

    have been sent to the Defendants. In addition, I personally followed up with several

    telephone calls thereafter to one Wang Tek Lee from the Defendants. During those phone

    calls, I advised the Defendants again that neither Trident nor the Plaintiffs were

    responsible for the debts owed by AFS prior to 31 July 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. The announcement, which was sent to FLE, was in the following

terms:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We are pleased to announce that effective from 1<sup>st</sup> August

    2000 AFS has undergone a change of ownership and has joined the N.A.C.A. (New American

    Consolidators Association) organization.</p>
<p align="justify">This change of ownership will also change our trading name to:</p>
<p align="justify">AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd</p>
<p align="justify">The previous structure of AFS Freight Forwarding operations, offices

    and personnel will remain unchanged and it is business as usual….</p>
<p align="justify">All invoices and credit notes up to 31<sup>st</sup> July 2000 in the

    name of [AFS] will continue to be processed and reconciled from Brisbane and we would ask

    that you refer any matters on this to:</p>
<p align="justify">AFS Freight Management Pty Ltd</p>
<p align="justify">[Queensland]</p>
<p align="justify">All invoices and credit notes for business arriving 1<sup>st</sup>

    August 2000 and thereafter will be finalised in the name of the new company and we would

    ask that you issue invoices/credit notes to the relevant office of [AFM 2000] as shown

    below. All shipment documentation, bills of lading, and airway bills are also to be issued

    to AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. I have no doubt that this announcement did not put the position

clearly. Mr Bob Hackett was honest enough to concede that the above-mentioned announcement

regarding the setting up of AFM 2000 and the treatment of accounts with effect from 1

August 2000 could have been more clearly worded. However, he asserted that whatever

ambiguities may have remained after the announcement, they were cleared up soon enough.

When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I can understand that if the announcement was the only communication

    that took place with the agents, there could be a misunderstanding. The reality of the

    situation was that all the announcements were followed by personal dialogue, telephone

    calls and other communications that I believed clarified with potential partners that this

    was a goodwill purchase and that the AFS debts were not acquired by the new company.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. Mr Hackett testified that he personally explained the position to

FLE when he came to Singapore in October 2000 and that the FLE team fully understood the

implications of their relationship with AFM 2000. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I went into more details in the October meeting. I told the defendants

    that Trident had purchased the business and not the company and that it had set up a new

    company to handle its business. I asked them if they understood and they said

    ‘yes’. I further explained that acquisition did not include debtors or

    creditors. Mr Wang said that he understood and accepted that. He said that there were some

    outstanding debts but I told them that they had to discuss these debts with the directors

    of the old company, Mr Reison and Mr Bell. That was the end of the discussion. It was not

    a long discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. Mr Hackett’s account of what transpired at the October 2000

meeting was supported by Mr Pece Gorgievski, who categorically denied that representations

had been made to FLE that AFM 2000 would assume liability for the AFS debt.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. Taking all circumstances into account, there can be no doubt that

the evidence of AFM 2000’s witnesses is more credible than that of FLE’s

witnesses. As FLE has not discharged the burden of proving that representations were made

to them that AFM 2000 would take over the AFS debt, their counterclaim against AFM 2000 is

dismissed with costs.</p>
