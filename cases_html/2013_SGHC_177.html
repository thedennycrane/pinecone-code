<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 3 May 2013, I heard the application of Mr
                    Michael Jacob Beloff QC (“the Applicant”) to be admitted on an ad
                    hoc basis pursuant to s 15 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed, as
                    amended in 2012) (“the Act”) to practise as an advocate and
                    solicitor in Singapore for the purpose of representing nTan Corporate Advisory
                    Pte Ltd (“NCA”) in certain proceedings I will elaborate on below.
                    This application met with strong opposition. On 17 May 2013, I allowed the
                    application. The decision has been appealed against and I now give my
                    grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The principal order that I made reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The Applicant be
                            admitted on an ad hoc basis pursuant to section 15 of the Legal
                            Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Revised Edition) to practice as an
                            advocate and solicitor in Singapore for the purposes of representing
                            nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd (RC No. 200102926R), the Other Party,
                            in:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Summons No. 5682 of 2012/A;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Summons No. 6520 of 2012/K;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Summons No. 6475 of 2012/C; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Summons No. 108 of 2013,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">in Civil Appeal No. 44 of 2010/E and Civil Appeal No. 47 of 2010/S, and
                        other ancillary proceedings which are directly related to or arise from the
                        aforesaid summonses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background to the application was somewhat
                    complicated. In October 2008, NCA was appointed as the independent financial
                    adviser of a Singapore incorporated company, TT International Ltd (“the
                    Company”), which was experiencing serious financial difficulties. The
                    fees payable by the Company to NCA for its services, as set out in two
                    engagement letters dated 28 October 2008 and 15 May 2009, included a value added
                    fee (“VAF”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 29 January 2009, the Company applied for and
                    received approval from the court pursuant to s 210(1) of the Companies Act (Cap
                    50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the COA”) to summon a meeting of its creditors
                    to consider a proposed scheme of arrangement (“the Scheme”).
                    Meetings of the Company’s creditors were held subsequently and, on 17
                    December 2009, the proposed Scheme Manager reported that the Scheme had been
                    passed by a majority of creditors representing 75.06% in value of the
                    Company’s debts. It should be noted that under the Scheme, the proposed
                    Scheme Manager was Mr Nicky Tan and/or Mr Dan Yock Hian and/or Ms Lim Siew
                    Soo who were all employees of NCA, Mr Nicky Tan being its chief executive
                    officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Company then applied for court sanction of
                    the Scheme. The application which came on for hearing before me in due course
                    was opposed by a number of the Company’s creditors. After hearing
                    arguments, I approved the Scheme. Two of the opposing creditors then appealed
                    against my decision (<em>vide</em> Civil Appeal No 44 of
                    2010/E and Civil Appeal No 47 of 2010/S (“CA 44” and “CA
                    47”)). On 27 August 2010, the Court of Appeal (“the CA”)
                    allowed the appeals. It also ordered that a fresh meeting of creditors be held
                    in accordance with various directions made by the CA. At the fresh meeting, the
                    requisite number of creditors voted in favour of the Scheme and, on 13 October
                    2010, the CA sanctioned the Scheme, subject to certain alterations made pursuant
                    to the powers awarded to the courts under s 210(4) of the COA. Subsequently a
                    monitoring committee (“the Monitoring Committee”) comprising three
                    of the Company’s creditors was formed to monitor the implementation of the
                    Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The CA’s directions were set out in its
                    brief grounds of decision dated 13 October 2010 (“Brief Grounds”).
                    On 31 January 2012, the CA released the full grounds of decision <em>viz The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank
                        NV) and others v TT International Ltd and another appeal</em> [2012]
                    SGCA 9 (subsequently reported in [2012] 2 SLR 213) (“the
                    Judgment”). The Judgment deals comprehensively and extensively with the
                    law in Singapore in relation to schemes of arrangement under s 210 of the
                    COA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before I proceed, I should say something about
                    the VAF as this fee lies at the heart of the dispute. The VAF was based on a
                    formula which provided for it to be calculated in relation to the savings or
                    capital injections obtained for the Company by the Scheme Manager. The VAF was
                    not disclosed to the Company’s creditors prior to either vote that was
                    taken in respect of the Scheme. Apparently, in the events that occurred, when
                    the formula was applied, the VAF worked out to be a very substantial sum in the
                    region of between $15m and $30m. The fees payable to NCA are not covered by the
                    Scheme and are payable by the Company in priority to the amounts owing to the
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A few days prior to the release of the Judgment,
                    M/s Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“R&amp;T”), acting as solicitors for the
                    Monitoring Committee, wrote a letter to the CA in which it raised the issue of
                    payment of the VAF due to NCA and raised certain queries regarding [8(j)] of the
                    Brief Grounds which had directed that all professional costs and disbursements
                    of the Scheme Manager and the Company’s professional advisers incurred
                    after 27 August 2010 should be taxed by the High Court. R&amp;T sought various
                    further directions from the CA in this respect. This letter led to an exchange
                    of correspondence (which included submissions from the parties) between the
                    parties and the CA during the period from 27 January 2012 until 10 April 2012.
                    The persons involved in this exchange were R&amp;T, M/s WongPartnership LLP
                    (“WongP”) which was acting for the Company and the Scheme
                    Manager’s solicitors, M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP
                    (“A&amp;G”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 27 September 2012, the CA handed down a
                    further written judgment in CA 44 and CA 47 (which was subsequently reported
                    under the same case name in [2012] 4 SLR 1182) dealing with the issues that had
                    been raised in the correspondence/submissions referred to in [8] above
                    (“the Second Judgment”). In brief, the CA held:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The existence of the VAF and its
                        estimated quantum were material information which ought to have been
                        disclosed by the Company and the Scheme Manager to the creditors and the CA
                        prior to sanction of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Scheme Manager was in a position of conflict as the
                        quantum of the VAF payable to NCA was dependent on the value of the debts
                        which would be adjudicated by the Scheme Manager himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Scheme would ordinarily have been
                        set aside and put to a fresh vote as a result of the non-disclosure of the
                        VAF to the creditors. However, as the Scheme had been implemented for more
                        than two years, it was not practical to set it aside since doing so would
                        cause more harm to the Company and the creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     The CA directed the Scheme Manager/NCA,
                        the Company and the Monitoring Committee to try and reach an agreement as to
                        the proper amount of professional fees to be awarded for NCA’s efforts
                        in reviving the Company to date. In the event that the parties were unable
                        to reach an agreement, NCA’s global fees (both before and after the
                        Scheme Manager’s appointment) would be assessed by a High Court Judge
                        in accordance with the principles stated in <em>Re Econ Corp
                            Ltd (in provisional liquidation)</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R)
                    264.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is NCA’s contention that in the
                    Second Judgment, the CA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     made several crucial findings of
                        fact (“Findings of Fact”) that directly affected NCA;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     on the
                        basis of the Findings of Fact, the CA gave directions relating to
                        NCA’s fees (“the Fee Orders”) as set out in [9(d)]
                        above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     NCA took the view that the Second Judgment is
                    not valid because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Findings of Fact and Fee Orders
                        were made, <em>inter alia</em>, without the necessary
                        jurisdiction; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     they were made in breach of the rules of natural justice, in
                        particular, the fair hearing rule, which gives all litigants the right to be
                        heard before a decision is taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 5 November 2012, NCA filed Summons No 5682
                    of 2012 in CA 44 (“Summons 5682”) and Summons No 6520 of 2012 in
                    CA 47 (together “the Summonses”). The relief sought in the
                    Summonses is the same. NCA wants:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     leave to intervene in the respective
                        appeal cases; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     substantively, for the CA to set aside the Second Judgment in each
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Summonses were, according to NCA, filed
                    only after it had obtained the advice of the Applicant. Having accepted the
                    Applicant’s advice, NCA was, not surprisingly, desirous of being
                    represented by the Applicant when the Summonses came on for hearing. Hence, on
                    22 November 2012 the present application was filed. Subsequently, the three
                    banks that formed the Monitoring Committee <em>viz</em>,
                    DBS Bank Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
                    (“the Interveners”) applied for permission to intervene in the
                    application so that they could oppose it. I granted that application. When the
                    Summonses came on for hearing, they were opposed by the Company, by the Law
                    Society, by the Attorney-General and by the Interveners. I shall hereafter
                    sometimes refer to these four parties collectively as “the Opposing
                    Parties”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The law relating to <em>ad
                        hoc</em> admission of foreign counsel to the Singapore Bar for the
                    purpose of representing litigants in domestic litigation in the Singapore courts
                    has undergone several changes over the years. From a fairly relaxed approach
                    which saw most such applications succeeding, the law moved to an extremely
                    restricted approach which made such admissions extremely rare. In 2012, the
                    position changed again and I had to consider the Applicant’s application
                    in relation to fairly recent statutory provisions. Fortunately, I had the
                    guidance of two reported decisions <em>viz</em>, <em>Re Andrews Geraldine Mary QC</em> [2013] 1 SLR 872
                        (“<em>Re Andrews</em>”) and <em>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC</em> [2013] 3 SLR
                66.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The present law regarding <em>ad hoc</em> admissions is set out at s 15 of the Act, with the
                    material sections being ss 15(1), (2) and (6A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15.—(1</b>)    Notwithstanding anything to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Pursuant to s 15(6A) of the Act, the Legal
                    Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notification 2012 (S 132/2012) (“the

                            whether to admit a person under section 15 of the Act for the purpose of

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the nature of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In considering the application, I bore in mind
                    the observations of V K Rajah JA in <em>Re Andrews</em>
                    regarding what the court had to do in dealing with such application. Rajah JA
                    pointed out that the court must strike a balance between a plurality of
                    objectives which include: (a) nurturing the local Bar, (b) allowing litigants to
                    engage counsel of their choice to advance their case as well as possible, and
                    (c) ensuring the proper and timely administration of justice. Another relevant
                    factor was whether there was a wider public interest in developing the local law
                    in the specific area(s) of law involved in the underlying dispute. This
                    balancing process was highly discretionary and would turn on the precise factual
                    matrix of each case. The court was required to engage in a judicious balancing
                    of the competing interests in each case: at [66] and [67].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Rajah JA also gave very useful advice on how
                    the criteria in the Notification should be handled. He said at [44] and
                    [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    In my view, the architecture of the 2012 Amendment
                            and the Notification plainly indicates that the courts are under a duty
                            to consider all the matters listed in para 3 of the Notification.
                                <em>The 2012 Amendment is not intended to lead to a
                                “free for all”, and in assessing applications
                                for</em> ad hoc <em>admission, the courts are
                                required to conduct a judicious balancing of the competing interests
                                in the particular case at hand within the framework of the matters
                                specified in para 3 of the Notification</em>. Interpreting
                            para 3 of the Notification to mean that the courts are obliged to
                            consider all the matters set out therein also ensures consistency in
                            assessing future applications for the ad hoc admission of foreign senior
                            counsel. In turn, this consistency in approach will lend some
                            predictability and certainty for both the Bar and litigants who intend
                            or are considering whether to apply for the ad hoc admission of foreign
                            senior counsel. At the same time, however, it hears emphasis that the
                            matters set out in para 3 of the Notification, and in particular, para
                            3(d) have been judiciously designed to be sufficiently flexible to allow
                            for the inclusion of other situational considerations which may carry
                            significant weight in a particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    The four criteria in para 3 of the Notification are
                            schematically set out in a mode that does not indicate any particular
                            precedence or that all four of the listed criteria must be identically
                            satisfied in every application for ad hoc admission. No particular
                            weight has been assigned to any of the matters identified as being
                            relevant in assessing the merits of an application. Paragraph 3 of the
                            Notification does not set out a new rigid four-stage test that replaces
                            the earlier test in s21 of the 1990 LPA of “sufficient difficult
                            and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the
                            case”. Additionally, the court is not obliged to invariably
                            accord equal weight to each of the matters listed in para 3 of the
                            Notification (see below at [63]). It would be inappropriate, and,
                            indeed, unprincipled, to give equal emphasis to the four matters
                            identified in para 3 of the Notification, given that the application of
                            these matters to the facts is necessarily fact-dependent. What the court
                            is obliged to do in considering an application for the ad hoc admission
                            of foreign senior counsel is to <em>carefully
                                evaluate</em> these matters in the exercise of its discretion
                            to grant or reject the application. Having considered all these matters,
                            the court may well decide that on the facts of a particular case, less
                            weight should be assigned to some or even most of them. In short, the
                            emphases to be placed on the matters identified in paras 3(<em>a</em>)-3(<em>d</em>) of the
                            Notification will necessarily vary from case to case. The court now has
                            a <em>substantial</em>, although not unfettered,
                            discretion in assessing the merits of each ad hoc admission
                            application.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Preliminary Objection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Law Society, the Company and the
                    Interveners raised the preliminary point that the application should be
                    considered on the basis that it fell within s 15(2) of the Act and that
                    therefore the Applicant could only be admitted if I was satisfied that there was
                    a special reason to do so. They argued that the Summonses dealt with matters of
                    administrative law and that was why they were covered by s 15(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     They noted that the definition of
                    administrative law given in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> vol 1 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2012 Reissue)
                        (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at para
                    10.001 was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Administrative law, like constitutional law, is a branch of public law. It
                        has been said to the law relating to administration, which law determines
                        the organisation, powers and duties of administrative authorities.
                        Administrative authorities include boards and tribunals. Another definition
                        is the body of principles, practices and institutions which provide
                        mechanisms for the supervision, regulation and structuring of the exercise
                        of executive power of government. <em>In this work, it is
                            understood to mean the law relating to the discharge of functions of a
                            public nature in government and administration. It includes functions of
                            public authorities, judicial review of the exercise of those
                            functions</em>, the civil liability and legal protection of those
                        purporting to exercise them …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Further, <em>Halsbury’s</em> had endeavoured to define “Public
                    authorities” in the following way (at para 10.005):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no official or statutory definition of the term “public
                        authority”. It is, however, used in this section to mean any person
                        or administrative body entrusted with functions or duties to perform for the
                        benefit of the public or for a public purpose generally and not for private
                        profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Using the above definitions, they contended
                    that because NCA was, by the Summonses, asking the CA, a public body, to set
                    aside its own judgment by reason of a lack of jurisdiction and for acting in
                    breach of the rules of natural justice, NCA was effectively seeking judicial
                    review of the Second Judgment. This, they argued, was clearly a matter under the
                    purview of administrative law. I should point out here that the Attorney-General
                    did not agree with this position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I had little hesitation in rejecting the
                    argument that the Summonses relate to administrative law. It is clear from the
                    definition of “administrative law” in <em>Halsbury’s</em> that this area of the law deals with, <em>inter alia</em>, the court’s powers to supervise the
                    discharge of powers by the executive and the conduct of hearings by inferior
                    tribunals. In exercising such supervisory powers, the court often has to
                    consider questions of jurisdiction and whether natural justice has been afforded
                    to the individuals affected by the administrative or tribunal decision which is
                    being challenged. That does not mean that when the court considers a challenge
                    to its own jurisdiction or whether any of its decisions can be impugned because
                    of an alleged breach of natural justice the challenge falls within the category
                    of administrative law or that the court’s consideration is in the nature
                    of “judicial review” within the commonly understood meaning of
                    that term. The Second Judgment is a judicial decision and not the decision of an
                    executive agency or an inferior tribunal. Nor was it made by an administrator
                    acting in an executive capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As <em>Marplan Private Limited
                        v Attorney-General</em> [2013] 3 SLR 201 makes clear, the challenge to
                    the Second Judgment does not concern issues of administrative law and is not
                    amenable to the prerogative writs which formed the original basis of
                    administrative law. In that case, the applicant applied for judicial review to
                    quash Lee Seiu Kin J’s decision in a District Court Appeal. Andrew Ang J
                    considered the application to be unsustainable and dismissed it. In the course
                    of his judgment, he said (at [22], [23], [24] and [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    The High Court is

                            court, its decisions are not susceptible to judicial review. Sinnathuray

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… Where courts are expressly declared by statute to be superior

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    Accepting the Applicant’s proposition that a
                            right of judicial review lies against a High Court decision (whether by
                            way of review by another High Court Judge or by the Court of Appeal)
                            would be tantamount to saying that the superior court of Singapore can
                            exercise supervisory jurisdiction over itself. This makes nonsense of
                            the word “supervisory”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     If the High Court is a superior court because
                    of the operation of the relevant legislation, then <em>a
                        fortiori</em> the CA is a superior court. The Summonses have been
                    filed in proceedings before the CA and it is the CA that will be hearing them
                    and deciding whether or not the Second Judgment can and/or should be set aside.
                    In undertaking this exercise the CA cannot be considered to be conducting a
                    supervisory exercise because, as Andrew Ang J pointed out, such an
                    interpretation would make “nonsense of the word
                    ‘supervisory’”. In dealing with the Summonses, the CA will be
                    considering how its own procedures may be regulated and what comprises the
                    nature and scope of judicial authority. Though some principles encountered in
                    this exercise may be principles that are also involved in administrative law,
                    this overlap does not transform the essential nature of the exercise into an
                    administrative law one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal criteria for ad hoc admission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In considering this application, I had, as
                    pointed out above, to consider the four matters set out in the Notification and
                    thereafter, had also to be satisfied that the Applicant satisfied s 15(1) of the
                    Act. There are three requirements in s 15(1). In this case the first two were
                    not disputed since the Applicant does hold Her Majesty’s Patent as
                    Queen’s Counsel and does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia
                    but will be coming here for the purpose of the Summonses. It was the third
                    requirement, <em>ie</em> whether the applicant had special
                    qualifications or experience for the purposes of the case that was in dispute. I
                    will deal with the Applicant’s qualifications and experience in the course
                    of discussing the factors laid down by the Notification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The nature of the factual and legal issues involved in the
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The first Notification factor required me to
                    identify and apply my mind to the legal and factual issues which had been raised
                    in the underlying case (see <em>Re Andrews</em> at [47]).
                        <em>Re Andrews</em> pointed out that some of the points
                    to be considered in this regard were whether the issues were novel (even if not
                    complicated and difficult); whether there were procedural complexities in the
                    underlying case; whether the underlying case would be of significant
                    precedential value; whether there would be public interest in that the case
                    would involve the development of Singapore law; and whether the integrity of the
                    litigant was impugned by the litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Applicant submitted that the Summonses
                    raise questions as to the extent to which the CA may exercise its powers in
                    relation to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     deciding (serious) factual
                        allegations between <em>inter alia</em> two non-parties
                        to the Appeal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     where the allegations were not part of the original action before the High
                        Court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     concerning a subject-matter which is a separate commercial agreement
                        between the Company and a non-party;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     with the result that the agreement, though otherwise
                        perfectly valid in law, is varied or re-written by the CA;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     in procedural
                        circumstances where there no hearing was conducted (despite repeated
                        requests) with the result that a judgment on fact and law was made only on
                        an exchange of letters between the non-parties and the
                CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Edwin Tong (“Mr Tong”),
                    counsel for the Applicant, fleshed out the points stated above in the following
                    manner. He said that the questions raised were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, what is the proper
                        jurisdiction of the CA over the parties (including the non-parties) to the
                        appeals in relation to matters raised after the appeals proper have been
                        disposed of in a situation where:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       at all material times, the
                            jurisdiction of the High Court and the CA was founded on s 210 of the
                            COA which gave them the jurisdiction (and discretion) to decide whether
                            or not to sanction the Scheme and, if so, on what terms. All submissions
                            and evidence put forward by the Company and the creditors before the
                            High Court and the CA addressed the question of whether the Scheme
                            should be sanctioned;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the VAF was not part of the Scheme but had
                            arisen before the Scheme on the basis of a separate contract between the
                            Company and its financial advisor NCA (thus giving rise to the issue
                            whether the CA had jurisdiction over the VAF as a private contract which
                            preceded the Scheme); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       NCA was not a party to the proceedings under s
                            210 and it was Mr Nicky Tan and two other persons who were appointed to
                            the post of Scheme Manager, the issue here being the extent to which the
                            CA is able to exercise jurisdiction at the appellate stage over a
                            non-party in respect of an issue which was not part of the original
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, if the CA has jurisdiction in relation in the
                        situations set out in (a) above, what powers would it have to enquire into
                        and make findings on a separate private agreement entered into between the
                        Company and a non-party (NCA) where the agreement was not made an issue by
                        any party in the appeal and in this respect, the questions that arise would
                        be:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       on what basis would the CA
                            be able to vary or re-write the contractual terms of NCA’s
                            engagement letter where the fee arrangement would otherwise be upheld as
                            a valid legal and binding agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       even if the creditors opposing the
                            Scheme had, during the hearing before the CA or High Court obtained
                            disclosure of the fees payable to NCA, the creditors would not have had
                            any cause of action on the VAF against NCA and therefore, can any
                            free-standing cause of action can exist in the appeals against NCA in
                            relation to the VAF and if so, by whom.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, even if the CA had jurisdiction
                        and powers to deal with the matters then:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether in considering the
                            same, there had been such a fundamental departure from due process as to
                            give rise to a breach of the principles of natural justice (and in this
                            respect, whether an exchange of letters on issues of fact and law can
                            constitute proper procedure); and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       if so, what would the appropriate remedies be
                            that could be granted to NCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my view, the essential issues which the
                    Summonses put forward before the CA are whether the CA had the jurisdiction to
                    decide, after it had issued its substantive judgment in the appeals before it, a
                    consequential question that arose between the creditors and an entity which was,
                    allegedly, not a party to the appeals, and secondly, if it did have such
                    jurisdiction whether there was a breach of natural justice in the way that the
                    question was dealt with. Embodied in these questions is the factual issue of
                    whether NCA was a party to the appeals and in that regard whether the Scheme
                    Manager was a party to the appeals and, if so, what effect that would have on
                    NCA’s position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     One issue that was canvassed a great deal by
                    the Opposing Parties was that of whether an appellate court has the inherent
                    jurisdiction to revisit and/or reopen its own judgment. This is an issue which
                    necessarily precedes the consideration of the issues set out in [30] above. The
                    Opposing Parties took the view that this is a settled question and does not
                    qualify as a difficult and novel issue which needs the assistance of foreign
                    counsel. I agreed that <em>Management Corporation Strata Title
                        Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 998
                        (“<em>Lee Tat</em>”) did establish that
                    the CA has inherent jurisdiction to reopen and rehear an issue which it decided
                    in breach of natural justice as well as to set aside the whole or part of its
                    earlier decision founded on that issue. In my view, however, <em>Lee Tat</em> although helpful to NCA in this respect, is very far
                    from being applicable to the wider jurisdictional questions that arise in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The questions that NCA has raised deal more
                    with the ability of the CA to make determinations after its primary function has
                    been fulfilled and the parties to whom those determinations can be made
                    applicable. The questions will require detailed consideration of the powers
                    bestowed on the court by s 210 of the COA and the Supreme Court of Judicature
                    Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (the “SCJA”) and the limits of the
                    “inherent” power relied on in <em>Lee
                        Tat</em>. The precise boundaries of that power remain to be
                    defined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Opposing Parties, while accepting that the
                    circumstances which gave rise to the Second Judgment were unique, argued that
                    there could be no doubting the ability of the CA to do what it did because it
                    “was simply exercising its jurisdiction to grant further directions as to
                    the manner in which [NCA’s] costs were to be determined, as it was
                    empowered to do under the SCJA and/or under its inherent jurisdiction”.
                    That submission airily missed the point – it is the width of the inherent
                    jurisdiction which is the issue here. They further argued that if NCA had wished
                    to put in further evidence or have matters set out on affidavit or heard by the
                    CA “it was open to [NCA] to make the relevant applications to be joined
                    as a party”. This submission seemed to recognise that NCA was not a party
                    to the proceedings but at the same time did not appreciate the effect such a
                    status might as a matter of law have on the ability of the court to make an
                    order binding on NCA. Dealing with the factual matrix, the Opposing Parties
                    submitted that it was straightforward and that at the core of the Summonses,
                    “the only issue is whether the [Second Judgment] was proper
                    notwithstanding that it was not delivered in the context of a formal application
                    being made. This is a question of law, not of fact”. That submission
                    indicated the existence of an ancillary issue which is to what extent and in
                    what circumstances the court can make orders when there is no formal application
                    before it. To my mind, that is not a straightforward issue and it is one that
                    will receive differing answers depending on the facts and, perhaps, applicable
                    legislation, in different cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Tong also submitted that the CA in Summons
                    5682 could not have reasonably made key findings of fact (based solely on an
                    exchange of letters) on, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    non-disclosure and suppression of the VAF, or acting in conflict of interest, or
                    taking advantage of the Company in executing the VAF, in the light of the fact
                    that the Monitoring Committee told the CA on 14 February 2012 that it was not
                    seeking a ruling on factual allegations. NCA will be asking the CA to consider
                    that the adverse factual findings against it contained in the Second Judgment
                    therefore, and reasonably, came as a complete surprise to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Opposing Parties argued that the facts in
                    the case are not complicated and I agreed that complex facts underlay the
                    Judgement rather than the Second Judgment. However, complexity did arise in
                    relation to the question of the CA’s ability to make factual findings in
                    the circumstances. This would depend partly on what evidence was before the
                    court in the underlying case. The other part of the question would depend on the
                    jurisdiction of the CA in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Having heard the arguments, I was satisfied
                    that the issues raised by the Summonses involved questions of law and procedure
                    which were fairly complex and required depth of knowledge and subtlety of
                    approach if they were going to be adequately explored and presented. Issues
                    involving the court’s jurisdiction which cannot be decided by a quick
                    reference to a statutory provision usually require sophisticated legal
                    reasoning. In any case, under the new regime, complexity is not the be-all and
                    end-all. In my view, the issues do not have to be extremely complex but simply
                    of a nature which the court considers would benefit from expertise of
                    knowledgeable and experienced counsel. In my judgement, the issues in the
                    Summonses met that standard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Necessity for foreign counsel and availability of local Senior
                Counsel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Re Andrews</em> at
                    [50], it was stated that the criterion of the necessity for foreign counsel is
                    to be taken “broadly” and in a “common-sense
                    manner”. It is for the court to consider what is necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Applicant submitted that various factors
                    supported the need for NCA to be represented by foreign counsel. First, all the
                    parties in CA 44 and CA 47 and the Interveners had been and continued to be
                    represented by Senior Counsel. Second, 14 law firms and their Senior Counsel
                    could not act for NCA as they were currently, or had previously been, involved
                    in the matter. Third, while currently there are 42 Senior Counsel in Singapore
                    who hold practising certificates, a substantial number of them are either in a
                    position of conflict or no longer litigate or do not practise in the relevant
                    areas of the law that concern this case. Given the issues raised, it was
                    reasonable for NCA to seek to be represented by an advocate with obvious
                    standing and with Commonwealth and appellate judicial experience to advise it
                    and appear on its behalf. Third, the Summonses raise serious questions
                    concerning the propriety of the CA’s process in this case and fundamental
                    questions as to its jurisdiction. The Law Society had conceded, having regard to
                    the nature of the application, this was an application which a local counsel
                    “may not relish” making. Fourth, given the complexity/novelty of
                    issues and the fact that other parties are, and had been from the start, all
                    represented by Senior Counsel, the court should place weight on an
                    “equality of arms” and the need for a level playing
                field.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I considered that it was in the context of
                    satisfying the court that there was a “need” for foreign counsel
                    that the Applicant faced the most difficulty. As the Opposing Parties were quick
                    to point out, NCA is a sophisticated and well-funded litigant. It is currently
                    represented by A&amp;G, one of Singapore’s largest law firms with an
                    established and respected litigation practice. This firm should have more than
                    adequate resources to deal with the necessary questions of fact and law.
                    Further, the law requires a litigant who wishes to be represented by foreign
                    counsel to make reasonably conscientious efforts to secure the services of
                    competent local counsel from the available pool. This included not only Senior
                    Counsel but other counsel with relevant experience. In this case, NCA had made
                    no efforts whatsoever to obtain the services of any Senior Counsel,
                    notwithstanding that A&amp;G itself has two Senior Counsel. It was submitted
                    that the present case was far from the situation envisaged by Parliament in
                    enacting the amendments being that of a litigant who is unable to find a large
                    firm to represent him because of issues of conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There was much force in those points. This was
                    especially so in relation to the capacity of A&amp;G to adequately represent
                    NCA. I should point out however, that Dr Stanley Lai, SC (“Dr Lai,
                    SC”), one of the firm’s Senior Counsel, has his main practice in
                    the area of intellectual property and would not be the obvious choice of a
                    litigant bringing a case like that under consideration. The other Senior Counsel
                    with A&amp;G, Mr Ang Cheng Hock, SC (“Mr Ang, SC”), has a much
                    wider area of practice and has been involved in cases which concerned, <em>inter alia</em>, natural justice issues. According to
                    A&amp;G’s own write-up, his practice “spans a wide range of civil
                    and commercial litigation and arbitration matters”. In fact, I had little
                    doubt that Mr Ang, SC and Mr Tong himself (although not a Senior Counsel) could
                    have handled this matter. However, I had also to consider in this connection,
                    the experience and expertise of the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Applicant was called to the English Bar by
                    Gray’s Inn in November 1967 and became a Queen’s Counsel in 1981. He
                    has therefore had more than 45 years of legal practice and experience. According
                    to the affidavit evidence, the Applicant had appeared as counsel more than 50
                    times in the House of Lords (eight times in the Supreme Court), ten times in the
                    Privy Council, 12 times in the European Court of Justice and 8 times in the
                    European Court of Human Rights. He had also appeared as counsel in the courts of
                    ten other Commonwealth countries including Singapore. In Singapore he had
                    appeared at least four times, primarily before the Court of Appeal. These cases
                    involved the discharge of a Mareva injunction, an application for a writ of
                        <em>habeas corpus</em>, floating charges and the
                    interpretation of a statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Applicant has also had extensive judicial
                    experience. He was appointed a Recorder of the Crown Court from 1984-95, a
                    Master of the Bench of Gray’s Inn in 1988, Deputy High Court Judge from
                    1989-96 (designated to sit in the Crown Office list), and Senior Counsel
                    Ordinary Appeal Judge of the Courts of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey from 2005
                    (Judge of the Courts of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey from 1995). In addition he
                    had been identified in various legal publications as a leading practitioner in
                    the areas of commercial, administrative and public law. He was one of six
                    barristers in the Times List of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in Great
                    Britain in 2008, 2009 and 2012. He was also the first Chairman of the
                    Administrative Law Bar Association from 1986-89 and is now a Vice-President and
                    Emeritus Chairman of that organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I was given a copy of the Applicant’s
                    CV. In addition to the matters stated above, this showed that the Applicant had
                    authored and contributed to many legal publications. Many of his contributions
                    were in respect of areas like human rights, judicial review, natural justice and
                    judges and judicial accountability. Further, the Applicant has delivered many
                    named lectures. Also provided was a long list of reported cases (463) in which
                    the Applicant was involved. These covered a wide range of commercial and public
                    law areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Attorney-General contended that it had not
                    been shown what relevant expertise or experience the Applicant had with regard
                    to Singapore’s judicial processes and practices. Mr Tong’s response,
                    which I accepted, was that the Applicant was extremely familiar with
                    Singapore’s legal procedure and system having argued in the Singapore
                    court on many previous occasions. This familiarity had been judicially noted
                    (see <em>Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R)
                    943 (“<em>Re Beloff</em>”) at
                [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     With due respect to Mr Ang, SC and Mr Tong, it
                    was obvious that they could not claim to have as wide ranging experience and
                    expertise as the Applicant. Indeed, there are few Senior Counsel in Singapore
                    with the years and range of experience of the Applicant. Having considered the
                    Applicant’s qualifications, it appeared to me that he would be able to
                    bring a depth of knowledge and court craft to the handling of the Summonses
                    which could be of great value to the CA. The Applicant’s experience on the
                    bench in various jurisdictions could also enable him to assist the CA in
                    relation to an appellate court’s jurisdiction to supplement an earlier
                    decision and to the appropriate procedures to be followed so as to ensure that
                    the rules of natural justice are observed. Whilst there may be different
                    provisions in different national territories governing the jurisdiction of the
                    national courts, the courts in which the Applicant has served are common law
                    courts which would have inherited traditions and attitudes that are similar to
                    those of the Singapore bench in regard to inherent jurisdiction and natural
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I also noted that it is no bar to a litigant
                    seeking to admit a Queen’s Counsel that the law firm that represents him
                    has Senior Counsel. In <em>Re David Joseph QC</em> [2012] 1
                    SLR 791, the applicant was admitted notwithstanding the fact that the litigant
                    was represented by WongP which then had four Senior Counsel among its lawyers.
                    At [52(b)], V K Rajah JA stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Respondent suggested that the Plaintiffs could obtain the
                        services of Senior Counsel (including, but not limited to, the four Senior
                        Counsel in Wong Partnership LLP). However, as I have pointed out earlier, I
                        do not think that there is an iron rule of law that the availability and
                        ability of local counsel is <em>per se</em> an absolute
                        bar to admission of a Queen’s Counsel. [original emphasis
                        omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The observation cited above was made in a case
                    that was decided under the old <em>ad hoc</em> admission
                    regime which imposed much stricter criteria for the admission of Queen’s
                    Counsel. Thus, it followed that under the present regime, there was no iron cast
                    rule precluding the Applicant’s admission because of the presumed
                    availability of Dr Lai, SC and Mr Ang, SC to handle the case. It all depended on
                    the overall circumstances of the case. Indeed, in <em>Re
                        Beloff</em>, the Applicant himself was admitted to act alongside Mr
                    Michael Hwang, SC who was already representing the litigant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is it reasonable in the circumstances to admit the
                Applicant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Applicant submitted that in all the
                    circumstances it was reasonable in this case to admit a Queen’s Counsel to
                    represent NCA. The issues in the case were significant and raised substantial
                    issues of jurisdiction and fair process. These questions arose against a factual
                    back-drop that was novel. This would be the first time that there would be any
                    judicial pronouncement as to the propriety of a fact-finding procedure deployed
                    by the CA to resolve factual issues at the appellate stage. Both Summonses would
                    have significant precedential value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I agreed with the Applicant that the
                    circumstances of the matter made it reasonable to allow the admission of a
                    foreign counsel to represent NCA. Such admission would obviously fulfil one
                    objective of the legislation, <em>ie</em> allowing
                    litigants to engage counsel of their choice to advance their case as well as
                    possible. I also thought that there was in this case a wider public interest in
                    developing local law in relation to the jurisdiction and powers of the CA. This
                    is an area of law that is not often explored in our courts and in this regard
                    the experience of counsel who has appeared before and also sat as a judge, in
                    different common law jurisdictions had the potential to add a great deal of
                    value to the exercise. Whilst the admission would not directly nurture the local
                    Bar, I did not consider that to be a significant factor in this case since the
                    factual and legal issues involved in the Summonses are, if not novel, then
                    somewhat arcane and of a nature that would not commonly arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Although NCA had made no effort to engage a
                    local Senior Counsel, I considered that that omission should not weigh too
                    heavily against it here since many Senior Counsel had already been involved in
                    the underlying case and very few Senior Counsel in Singapore, including those in
                    A&amp;G, have the breadth of experience of the Applicant. I was also strongly
                    influenced by the nature of the case that NCA wishes to make. Local counsel
                    acted very competently for the litigants in <em>Lee
                        Tat</em> but the present case has complications that did not exist
                    there especially in relation to the allegation of improper fact-finding. When
                    pressing such arguments, NCA would naturally wish to be represented by counsel
                    in whom they could have the greatest confidence because of his learning and
                    experience in the relevant legal areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the reasons given above, I was satisfied
                    that this was a proper case in which to admit the Applicant to practise under s
                    15(1) of the Act.</p>
