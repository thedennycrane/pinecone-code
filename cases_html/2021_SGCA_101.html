font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 The desire to do justice is at the heart of the legal process. In the context of criminal justice, that objective is commonly understood to mean the proper adjudication of guilt and the determination of truth. Yet, as we observed in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>”) at [47], we must never lose sight of another equally important function of justice, which is the attainment of <span class="font-italic">finality</span>. After all, to permit “an endless repetition of inquiry into facts and law in a vain search for ultimate certitude implies a lack of confidence about the possibilities of justice that cannot but war with the effectiveness of the underlying substantive commands” (see Paul M Bator, “Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners” (1963) 76(3) Harv L Rev 441 (“<span class="font-italic">Bator</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 452). There must therefore come a point where a concluded court decision may legitimately be left in a state of repose, unencumbered by the prospect of further judicial review (see <span class="font-italic">Mackey v United States </span>401 US 667 (1971) (“<span class="font-italic">Mackey</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 683).</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div><hr/><div class="row"><div class="col col-md-12 align-self-center"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The balance between the search for truth and the attainment of finality is one which every legal system will inevitably have to negotiate. A system that leaves no room for corrigibility risks the ultimate injustice of condemning the innocent and allowing the guilty to go unpunished. On the other hand, a system that caters to a perpetual and unreasoned anxiety of error would do violence to the search for closure that the pursuit of every legal contest awaits (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [50]). In <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, we<span class="font-italic"> </span>examined the balance between truth and finality in the context of legal arguments that were belatedly raised after the appellant had been convicted and his appeal, dismissed. The applications before us raised the related but distinct issue of when a court may reopen an earlier decision on the basis of <span class="font-italic">subsequent changes in the law</span>. We therefore considered that these applications presented an opportunity to clarify the conditions under which such a change can form the basis for reopening a previous court decision that was properly made in accordance with the law at the material time, a subject which has hitherto not been considered in our jurisprudence. In this judgment, when we refer to a subsequent change in the law, we mean one that is effected by a judicial decision, unless otherwise indicated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We begin by setting out the relevant background facts. The backdrop to these applications is our decision in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan </span><span class="font-italic">Chandaram v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2020] 2 SLR 95 (“<span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>”), in which we considered the permissibility of the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice”. Under the “dual charging practice”, where a single compressed block of cannabis-related plant material was certified by the Health Sciences Authority as containing (a) cannabis and (b) fragmented vegetable matter containing cannabinol (“CBN”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the Prosecution would consider preferring both (a) a charge in respect of the portion certified to consist purely of cannabis, and (b) a charge in respect of the portion consisting of fragmented vegetable matter that had been found to contain CBN and THC. We held in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan </span>(at [197] and [198(c)]) that the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice” was impermissible. More recently, we reaffirmed the impermissibility of the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice” in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Karim bin Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Kuppai Khan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1390<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Karim</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The respondents in these applications had been charged with and convicted pursuant to the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice”. Following our decision in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Prosecution filed these applications inviting us to review our previous decisions in relation to the respondents, set aside the cannabis mixture charges that had been preferred against them in accordance with the “dual charging practice” and consequently reconsider the sentences imposed on them. However, by way of a letter dated 15 February 2021 (“the PP’s Letter”), the Prosecution sought leave to withdraw all four applications. The Prosecution took the stance that <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> did not automatically apply to the respondents as their cases pre-dated <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> and had been decided in accordance with the prevailing law then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 After hearing the parties, we granted the Prosecution leave to withdraw the applications. We saw no juridical basis for refusing to allow the Prosecution to do so and the respondents did not contend otherwise. The Public Prosecutor has carriage of prosecutions and is constitutionally vested with prosecutorial power, exercisable at his discretion, in the conduct of any criminal proceedings (see Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”)). That discretion necessarily extends to the continuance or withdrawal of the applications before us. There was also no suggestion that the withdrawal of the applications would be tantamount to an abuse of either the judicial process or prosecutorial power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Prosecution’s withdrawal of the applications nevertheless leaves open the possibility of the respondents filing their own applications to seek to reopen their convictions and/or sentences. We therefore indicated to the parties that we would issue these written grounds to elaborate on the applicable threshold for the court to revisit its prior disposal of a case where there has been a change in the law. We also highlighted that, following our review of the authorities, the threshold was that of <span class="font-italic">substantial </span><span class="font-italic">injustice </span>and would not easily be met. It is to this discussion that we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The finality of court decisions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The starting position of our analysis is that every judgment of the court is final. This proposition applies with stronger force to decisions in concluded <span class="font-italic">appeals</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As we explained in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [49], “[a]s we venture further along the criminal process, we must give greater presumptive weight to the veracity of the findings already made and accord greater prominence to the principle of finality”. In the same vein, we recently observed in <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGCA 89 at [2] that “the issuance of a final judgment by this [c]ourt brings an end to the legal process available to parties in relation to a criminal conviction or sentence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Given that concluded criminal matters, and particularly concluded criminal appeals, are final and cannot be reopened on their merits, it follows that a matter ordinarily cannot be reopened just because there has been a subsequent change in the law. Any reconsideration of a concluded matter based on a subsequent change in the law is necessarily concerned with the <span class="font-italic">merits </span>of that matter, which the court typically has neither the jurisdiction nor power to re-assess (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Zhan Quan Tony v Public Prosecutor and another motion </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 830 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Tony</span>”) at [29]). The judicial reluctance to undo decisions that were properly made in accordance with the law as it was then understood is grounded principally in respect for the finality of judgments, which is the principle that litigation must at some definite point be brought to an end (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">FTC v Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulatory Co </span>344 US 206 (1952) at 213). Once the trial and appellate processes have run their course, a presumption of finality and legality attaches to the conviction and sentence (see <span class="font-italic">Barefoot v Estelle </span>463 US 880 (1983) at 887). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The principle of finality has been described, perhaps unfairly, in some quarters as the notion that “in most matters, it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right” (see <span class="font-italic">Burnet v Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co </span>285 US 393 (1932) at 406). To those who subscribe to such a view, the principle of finality may appear to be at odds with the interests of justice; specifically, the correction of error and the search for truth. In our view, however, there are three main reasons why the principle of finality is not only compatible with, but also <span class="font-italic">integral </span>to, justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 First, respect for finality maximises scarce judicial resources by channelling them towards more productive ends. Applications “litigating the validity under present law of criminal convictions that were perfectly free from error when made final” take up valuable resources which should instead go towards the disposal of cases being heard for the first time (see <span class="font-italic">Mackey</span> at 691). In contrast, the subjects of concluded criminal appeals have had two opportunities, before the trial and appellate courts, to defend their positions. Attempts to reopen concluded criminal appeals are wasteful because they essentially afford litigants a third bite of the cherry (see Ryan W Scott, “In Defense of the Finality of Criminal Sentences on Collateral Review” (2014) 4(1) Wake Forest Journal of Law and Policy 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Scott</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 185–186). This is not merely a logistical concern but one with profound implications for access to justice by the large number of other litigants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Second, the finality of court judgments is crucial to the effectiveness of the deterrent and rehabilitative functions of the criminal justice system. It is essential to the deterrent function of the criminal law that “we be able to say that one violating [the] law will swiftly and certainly become subject to … just punishment” (see <span class="font-italic">Bator</span> at 452; see also <span class="font-italic">Teague v Lane </span>489 US 288 (1989) at 309). The endless reopening of concluded criminal appeals is also injurious to the rehabilitation of offenders. After all, rehabilitation begins with an offender’s acceptance that he has been justly sanctioned and that he stands in need of re-education. The rehabilitative process cannot possibly begin if “the cardinal moral predicate is missing, if society itself continuously tells the [offender] that he may not be justly subject to [re-education]” in the first place (see <span class="font-italic">Bator </span>at 452).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Third, and most importantly, the finality of court decisions is fundamental to the very integrity of the judicial process. As we emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [47], “[n]othing can be as corrosive of general confidence in the criminal process as an entrenched culture of self-doubt engendered by abusive and repetitive attempts to re-litigate matters which have already been decided”. An unbounded willingness to reopen concluded criminal appeals denies cases the closure that they deserve, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the judicial process itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 For these reasons, final judgments, particularly those issued by an appellate court, will not be readily unsettled. After finality attaches, a judgment stands even if the law subsequently changes. However, there are two ways in which the court’s revisionary powers may be invoked to permit a departure from the default position of finality. These are: (a) the Court of Appeal’s inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal; and (b) an appellate court’s statutory power to review its earlier decision under s 394I of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). We now proceed to examine each of these in turn.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s revisionary powers to reopen concluded decisions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Court of Appeal’s inherent power to reopen concluded criminal appeals</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We first consider the Court of Appeal’s inherent power to reopen concluded criminal appeals. That such an inherent power exists has not always been settled law. Prior to 2010, the Court of Appeal held in several decisions that once it had delivered its judgment in a criminal appeal, its appellate jurisdiction ceased and it was <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. It was reasoned on this basis that upon the conclusion of a criminal appeal, the Court of Appeal did not have any statutorily-conferred jurisdiction to reopen a matter and reconsider its substantive merits: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Abdullah bin A Rahman v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 1017 at [10] and [13]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Chye v Public Prosecutor </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 1024 at [8] and [12]; <span class="font-italic">Jabar</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Kadermastan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 326 at [58]; and <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Mourthi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 518 at [4]–[8]. In these cases, the Court of Appeal held that the conclusion of the appellate process meant that it was jurisdictionally foreclosed from hearing applications to adduce fresh evidence, staying a sentence of death or hearing a second appeal. Those decisions are but the logical extension of the default position set out at [7]–[8] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 An exception to the default position was first identified in <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony</span>. The applicants there had been charged with murder but were convicted by the High Court of the lesser offence of robbery with hurt. Upon the Prosecution’s appeal in CA/CCA 2/2005 (“CCA 2/2005”), the Court of Appeal substituted the convictions for robbery with hurt with convictions for murder. The applicants then filed criminal motions to the Court of Appeal, contending that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the substantive merits of CCA 2/2005 in the first place (“the Jurisdictional Issue”). According to the applicants, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the 1999 SCJA”) only permitted the Prosecution to appeal against <span class="font-italic">acquittal</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, whereas they had been <span class="font-italic">convicted</span> by the High Court, albeit of a lesser offence. The Prosecution argued that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to consider the criminal motions as it had already disposed of the substantive merits of CCA 2/2005 and was thus <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Court of Appeal held that it had both the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> and the <span class="font-italic">power </span>to hear the criminal motions. The Jurisdictional Issue ought to have constituted an integral part of CCA 2/2005 and the applicants were not estopped from raising that issue in the criminal motions (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony </span>at [23]). The Court of Appeal therefore concluded (at [23]) that it remained “properly seised of the present case in so far as the question of <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> [was] concerned” [emphasis in original]. There was also no question that the Court of Appeal had the power to decide the Jurisdictional Issue by virtue of s 29A(4) of the 1999 SCJA (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony</span> at [23]–[24]). In summary, the Court of Appeal held that if an application to reopen a concluded criminal appeal was premised on a challenge to the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to hear the appeal in the first place, rather than a challenge to the substantive merits of the appeal, the court would<span class="font-italic"> </span>remain seised of jurisdiction to hear the matter even if it had already ruled on the merits of the appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony</span>, however,<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not go so far as to authorise the Court of Appeal to review the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of an already concluded criminal appeal. The Court of Appeal only held that it had the jurisdiction and power to determine the Jurisdictional Issue; indeed, it took great pains to clarify that it remained <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>in so far as the substantive merits of CCA 2/2005 were concerned (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony </span>at [22] and [29]). As the Court of Appeal emphasised (at [29]), its decision was “not a <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>for this court to review its previous decisions when it is truly <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. In particular, this court has neither the jurisdiction nor power to review the substantive merits of the case”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 After <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony </span>came our decision in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 2 SLR 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong</span>”). The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>had been convicted on a capital drug trafficking charge. He filed a notice of appeal but subsequently withdrew his appeal. He then filed a criminal motion petitioning the Court of Appeal to treat the previous withdrawal of his appeal as a nullity and to restore his appeal for hearing. The Prosecution argued that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the criminal motion because the applicant’s appeal, once withdrawn, was deemed to have been dismissed on its merits, with the result that the court was <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> and could not hear any further appeal against his conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Court of Appeal held (at [26]–[28]) that the applicant’s withdrawal of his appeal was a nullity as he had laboured under a fundamental mistake at the material time. The applicant was thus allowed to proceed with his appeal. More importantly, the Court of Appeal observed (at [15]–[16]), albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that even if the substantive merits of the appeal had already been heard and decided, it might nonetheless have the jurisdiction to hear further arguments on those substantive merits:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 … Suppose, in a case where the appellate court dismisses an appeal against conviction and the next day the appellant manages to discover some evidence or <span class="font-italic">a line of authorities</span> that show that he has been wrongly convicted, is the court to say that it is <span class="font-italic">functus </span>and, therefore, the appellant should look to the Executive for a pardon or a clemency? <span class="font-italic">In circumstances where there is sufficient material on which the court can say that there has been a miscarriage of justice, this court should be able to correct such mistakes</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 Another argument which this court should take into account (but which has never been addressed to the court), is that Art 93 of the Constitution vests the judicial power of Singapore in the Supreme Court. The judicial power is exercisable only where the court has jurisdiction, but where the SCJA does not expressly state when its jurisdiction in a criminal appeal ends, there is no reason for this court to circumscribe its own jurisdiction to render itself incapable of correcting a miscarriage of justice at any time. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>(at [18]), the operative question in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>was not whether the court <span class="font-italic">could </span>reconsider its previous decision in a concluded criminal appeal (in the sense of whether it had the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to do so), but whether it <span class="font-italic">ought </span>to do so<span class="font-italic"> </span>(in the sense of whether it ought to exercise its <span class="font-italic">power</span> to that end). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A gradual shift in the Court of Appeal’s approach can thus be discerned. Although it was held in <span class="font-italic">Koh Tony</span> that any review of an appellate decision was confined to the specific question of whether the court had the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to hear the appeal, the court in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>intimated its willingness to review the <span class="font-italic">merits </span>of its earlier decision if the interests of justice so required. This change in judicial attitude culminated in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, in which the Court of Appeal held (at [77(a)]) that, as the final appellate court in Singapore, it had the inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. In line with the point raised by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>(at [16]), the Court of Appeal held that its inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal was a facet of the judicial power vested in it by virtue of Art 93 of the Constitution. When the court exercised this “power of review”, it was acting within the scope of its statutorily-conferred appellate jurisdiction, which was not completely exhausted upon rendering a decision on the merits of the appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [77(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 When, then, might the court exercise its inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal? An applicant for such relief had to satisfy the court that there was sufficient material on which it could conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [77(b)]). Material tendered in support of a review application would only be “sufficient” if it was “new” <span class="font-italic">and</span> “compelling” (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [52]). The Court of Appeal accepted (at [53]) that new legal arguments <span class="font-italic">could </span>form the basis of a review application if such arguments were “new”, in the sense that they: (a) had not been considered at an earlier stage of the proceedings; and (b) were material which could not, even with reasonable diligence, have been presented to the court before the filing of the review application. The Court of Appeal further observed (at [58]) that new legal arguments would, by and large, only be able to constitute the basis for a review application if such arguments were made following a change in the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In order for the material in support of a review application to be “compelling”, the material had to be “reliable, substantial and powerfully probative” such that it could show “almost conclusively” that there had been a “miscarriage of justice” (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [59]–[61]). The Court of Appeal indicated (at [60]) that a new line of legal authorities would be objective and, hence, potentially reliable material. Material would be considered “substantial” and “powerfully probative” if it was logically relevant to the precise issues which were in dispute (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As mentioned at [21] above, the court would only exercise its inherent power of review if there was a “miscarriage of justice”. In general, the court would only find that there was a “miscarriage of justice” in the following situations (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [65], [69], [70] and [77(e)]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court might find that a decision on conviction or sentence had been shown to be “demonstrably wrong”. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In relation to a decision on conviction, the applicant had to show that it was apparent, based on the evidence tendered in support of the application alone, that there was a powerful probability that the decision was wrong.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In relation to a decision on sentence, the applicant had to show that the decision was based on some fundamental misapprehension of the law and was thus blatantly wrong on the face of the record.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court might find that the impugned decision was tainted by fraud or a breach of natural justice, such that the integrity of the judicial process had been compromised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Court of Appeal ultimately declined to exercise its inherent power of review in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>. This was because the legal arguments raised by the applicant at the eleventh hour were neither new nor compelling and thus failed to satisfy the prerequisites for the court’s exercise of its inherent power of review.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 That is an overview of the Court of Appeal’s inherent power of review, as it has developed over time. We now turn to an appellate court’s statutory power of review under s 394I of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An appellate court’s statutory power of review under s 394I of the CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Section 394I of the CPC sets out the procedure by which an appellate court may review its earlier decision. While only the Court of Appeal, as the final appellate court in Singapore, possesses the inherent power of review (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [77(a)]), the statutory power of review may be exercised by both the General Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, so long as the decision sought to be reviewed is a decision of an appellate court on the merits of an appeal (see s 394G(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Section 394J of the CPC codifies the requirements for an appellate court’s exercise of its power of review as set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> and provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Requirements for exercise of power of review under this Division</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">394J.</span>—(1) This section —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) sets out the requirements that must be satisfied by an applicant in a review application before an appellate court will exercise its power of review under this Division;

The Minister expressed that “[t]he re-opening procedure, including the relevant threshold tests, is largely a codification of a number of considered decisions made by the Court of Appeal in balancing the interests of finality against the need to prevent a miscarriage of justice” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 March 2018) vol 94 (Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Law)). The decisions that the Minister referred to would have included our decisions in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>and, perhaps to a lesser extent, <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 We make four observations on the court’s statutory power of review. First, s 394J(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC makes it clear that an appellate court’s <span class="font-italic">statutory </span>power of review does not affect its <span class="font-italic">inherent power </span>to review an earlier decision on its own motion. The same point was underscored by the Minister during the relevant Parliamentary debates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, while an applicant may challenge the court’s decision in a concluded criminal appeal by invoking either the court’s statutory power of review under s 394I of the CPC or its inherent power (per <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>), the substance of any such application is typically unaffected by the choice of remedial avenue. This follows from the fact that s 394J of the CPC codifies the requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, a fact which the Minister noted in Parliament. It is unsurprising that the requirements under s 394J of the CPC mirror those laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>; indeed, it might be somewhat arbitrary if the success of a review application were contingent on one’s choice of remedial avenue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, and following from the point we have just made, even though the substance of a review application remains the same regardless of which remedial avenue is utilised, the two avenues are not duplicative. An applicant may make only one review application under s 394I of the CPC in respect of any decision of an appellate court (see s 394K of the CPC). This means that where “sufficient material” on which an appellate court may conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice only emerges <span class="font-italic">after</span> a prior review application brought under s 394I of the CPC has been heard and dismissed, an applicant may have further recourse to the court’s inherent power of review but not to its statutory power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Our fourth and final point is of particular importance for present purposes: Parliament had clearly contemplated that a subsequent change in the law could constitute the basis for a review application under s 394I of the CPC. This is made explicit in s 394J(4), which provides that any material consisting of legal arguments will only be “sufficient” within the meaning of s 394J(2) if, in addition to satisfying all the requirements set out in s 394J(3), it is based on “<span class="font-italic">a change in the law </span>that arose from any decision made by a court after the conclusion of all proceedings relating to the criminal matter in respect of which the earlier decision was made” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The conditions under which an appellate court may reopen an earlier decision in the light of a subsequent change in the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 To consolidate the foregoing analysis, judgments of the court are final and judgments of an appellate court cannot ordinarily be reopened on their merits. A subsequent change in the law <span class="font-italic">without more </span>would not constitute sufficient grounds on which the court may exercise either its inherent or statutory power of review (see [7]–[8] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We have consistently held that a mere change in the law would not justify the exercise of our revisionary powers: see <span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 929 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24] and <span class="font-italic">Ng Kim Han and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 397 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kim Han</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22]. The question that then arises is: under what conditions may an appellate court reopen the merits of an earlier decision following a change in the law? It is to this question that we now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 There is a dearth of local authorities to guide us. This is perhaps unsurprising: the Court of Appeal’s inherent power to reopen concluded criminal appeals was only expressly recognised in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>in 2016, and the court’s statutory power of review came into effect later still on 31 October 2018. From our review of the case law, it appeared that since 2016 and until the present criminal motions were filed, only one review application had been made on the basis of a subsequent change in the law. That application culminated in our decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”), a case which we return to at [97]–[100] below. Given the paucity of local authorities on the issue at hand, some guidance may be usefully drawn from the English authorities concerning the analogous issue of granting leave to appeal out of time following a change in the law. It should be noted that the objection to granting such an extension of time is surely less weighty than that to reopening a concluded matter after the appellate process has been exhausted. Nonetheless, the principles in the English authorities are instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As it turns out, one of the relevant English authorities concerns the proper interpretation of the term “cannabis”. This is very similar to the issue that we were confronted with in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>, the decision upon which these criminal motions were founded. In <span class="font-italic">R v Mitchell </span>[1977] 2 All Er 168 (“<span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span>”), the appellant had been convicted on two counts of possession of cannabis with intent to supply, among other charges. The cannabis in question comprised the leaf, stalk and clean seeds of the cannabis plant. The appellant was granted leave to appeal against his sentence. Following the appellant’s conviction but before his appeal against sentence was heard, the English Court of Appeal held in a separate matter that the leaf and the stalk of the cannabis plant did not fall within the mischief targeted by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”). The appellant then sought an extension of time to appeal against his conviction. The central question in <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span> was whether the clean seeds of the cannabis plant were “cannabis” within the meaning of s 37(1) of the 1971 Act. The English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) held (at 170J–171B) that only those parts of the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant that contained cannabis resin were caught by the 1971 Act. Although the clean seeds were part of the fruiting tops of the cannabis plant, they did not contain cannabis resin and were hence not “cannabis” for the purposes of s 37(1) of the 1971 Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 But that was not the end of the matter. The court went on to consider (at 171C) whether to grant the appellant an extension of time to file an appeal against his conviction, given that “[t]he appellant ha[d] been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for an offence which on the facts was not a crime”. As the court explained, the starting position was that a mere change in the law would not justify granting an extension of time to file an appeal:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It should be clearly understood, and this court wants to make it even more abundantly clear, that <span class="font-italic">the fact that there has been an apparent change in the law or, to put it more precisely, that previous misconceptions about the meaning of a statute have been put right, does not afford a proper ground for allowing an extension of time in which to appeal against conviction</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On the facts, the court allowed the appellant’s application for an extension of time and granted him leave to appeal against his conviction for two reasons. First, the court noted (at 171G) that the appellant had already been granted leave to appeal against his <span class="font-italic">sentence</span>. If it refused to grant the appellant an extension of time to appeal against his <span class="font-italic">conviction</span>, it would be faced with “the totally unreal task of endeavouring to determine what the correct sentence was for an offence which had not been committed”. The second factor that made the case “something of an extraordinary case” was the fact that the appellant was in prison. Although the appellant was serving a concurrent sentence for other offences, that concurrent sentence ought to have been over or nearly over as at the date on which his application was heard, assuming he had earned his full remission. Should the court refuse to grant him an extension of time to appeal against his conviction, it would effectively be keeping him in prison for an offence he had not committed (see <span class="font-italic">Mitchell </span>at 171H–171J). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The court was thus satisfied that the matter was a “very rare case” that warranted the exercise of its discretion to grant the appellant an extension of time and leave to appeal against his conviction (see <span class="font-italic">Mitchell </span>at 171J). Nonetheless, the court took care to clarify (at 172A) that its decision ought not to be construed as an invitation to every offender who had been convicted of similar offences to seek leave to appeal out of time, and emphasised that such applications “[would] not be greeted with very much enthusiasm”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In arriving at its decision, the court also referred to the unreported decision of <span class="font-italic">R v Ramsden </span>[1972] Crim LR 547 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramsden</span>”), in which it was stated that “[w]here a subsequent decision of a superior court has produced an apparent change in the law, that <span class="font-italic">coupled with other circumstances </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> be a factor which will induce the court to grant leave to appeal out of time. Nevertheless … this must in every case be a matter of discretion.” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (see <span class="font-italic">Mitchell </span>at 171D–171E). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendant in <span class="font-italic">Ramsden </span>had been convicted of dangerous driving before it was subsequently held that fault was a necessary element of that offence. Refusing to grant the defendant leave to appeal out of time, the court observed that alarming consequences would flow if it were to permit the general reopening of old cases on the ground that a subsequent decision had dispelled a widely held misconception about the law underpinning the defendant’s conviction. Had the court granted the extension of time sought, “[n]o doubt … everyone convicted of dangerous driving over a period of several years could have advanced the same application” (see also <span class="font-italic">R v Jawad (</span><span class="font-italic">Mohid) </span>[2013] EWCA Crim 644 (“<span class="font-italic">Jawad</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]). In other words, the court in <span class="font-italic">Ramsden </span>had regard to the potential impact on <span class="font-italic">other</span> decided cases in deciding not to grant the extension of time sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The case of <span class="font-italic">R v Hawkins</span> [1997] 1 Cr App Rep 234 (“<span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>”) is also instructive. The applicant there had pleaded guilty to and was convicted of five counts of obtaining property by deception under s 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968 (“Theft Act”), among other charges. Thereafter, it was separately held that a chose in action created by an electronic bank transfer was not “property belonging to another” that could be “obtained” by deception under s 15(1) of the Theft Act. The applicant cited this change in the law and sought leave to appeal against his conviction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The court expressed that it had to be persuaded that there was a “good reason” for granting leave to appeal out of time, particularly where a defendant had pleaded guilty (as the applicant had) or had made a conscious decision not to appeal. Citing authorities such as <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ramsden</span>, the court noted that a change in the law after the date of conviction or plea of guilty would not usually be regarded as a good reason for granting leave to appeal out of time. The court further stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That practice may on its face seem harsh. On the other hand, … any other rule … would mean that a defendant who had roundly and on advice accepted that he had acted dishonestly and fraudulently, and pleaded guilty, or who had been found guilty and chosen not to appeal, could after the event seek to reopen the convictions. If such convictions were to be readily reopened it would be difficult to know where to draw the line or how far to go back.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Nonetheless, the court noted that despite the general rule against reopening a conviction where a defendant had pleaded guilty, it would “eschew undue technicality and ask whether any <span class="font-italic">substantial injustice </span>has been done” [emphasis added]. Having concluded that the applicant had not suffered any substantial injury, the court refused the extension of time sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 What is of note is that in arriving at its conclusion, the court found it “arguable” that, based on the admitted facts, the jury could have convicted the applicant for <span class="font-italic">other </span>property offences. In our judgment, this is a significant factor that differentiates <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span> from <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span>, the applicant had only been in possession of parts of the cannabis plant that did not contain cannabis resin and were hence not “cannabis” within the meaning of s 37(1) of the 1971 Act. It follows that he could not have been convicted on any alternative charges and that substantial injustice had arisen from his wrongful incarceration. On the other hand, the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Hawkins </span>had admitted to dishonest or fraudulent conduct which could have supported convictions for other offences. Any injustice that he had suffered was therefore less readily apparent and, in any event, did not appear to be “substantial”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the same vein, it was held in <span class="font-italic">R v Ramzan and others </span>[2006] EWCA Crim 1974 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that whether a defendant could be said to be guilty of <span class="font-italic">other </span>offences was a relevant factor when considering whether substantial injustice had been established. <span class="font-italic">Ramzan </span>concerned several appeals and applications by defendants who had been convicted of conspiracy to commit money-laundering offences. Following their convictions, there was a change in the law regarding the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>for conspiracy to launder money. The defendants appealed against or sought leave to appeal against their convictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The court stressed (at [39] and [54]) that even though the convictions for conspiracy could no longer stand, on the defendants’ own cases taken together with the juries’ verdicts, all the defendants must have committed one or more substantive offences of money-laundering for which the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>remained unchanged. Hence, even if the subsequent change in the law had been known at their trials, they would nonetheless have been convicted of “substantive offences of great gravity”. Accordingly, subject to any individual grounds for finding substantial injustice, “these [were] strong cases for refusal of leave”. In considering the individual cases, the court repeatedly stated that those defendants who must nonetheless have committed substantive money-laundering offences would not have suffered substantial injustice by virtue of their convictions for conspiracy. Leave to appeal was accordingly refused in those cases (see <span class="font-italic">Ramzan </span>at [70], [71], [73], [75] and [78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We next consider the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Benjafield</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2003] 1 AC 1099 (“<span class="font-italic">Benjafield</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Benjafield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was a set of consolidated appeals and applications by defendants who had been convicted of drug and property offences and against whom confiscation orders had been made. The Human Rights Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”) came into force after those confiscation orders had been made. One of the defendants (“Mr Rezvi”) applied for leave to appeal against his sentence five months out of time. All the defendants contended that the statutory bases for the confiscation orders were incompatible with the right to a fair hearing and the presumption of innocence enshrined in Arts 6(1) and 6(2) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which was scheduled to the 1998 Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The House of Lords granted Mr Rezvi’s application for leave to appeal out of time because it considered that his appeal raised issues of considerable general interest (see <span class="font-italic">Benjafield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]). Nonetheless, the House of Lords expressly confirmed (at [46]) that “[i]t is not usual to grant leave to appeal out of time where the grounds of appeal are based on post-trial changes in the law”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 <span class="font-italic">R v Ballinger</span> [2005] EWCA Crim 1060 (“<span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>is another case that illustrates the strictness of the principle that leave to appeal out of time will not ordinarily be granted where there has been nothing more than a change in the law post-conviction. The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> had been convicted of indecent assault at a naval court martial presided over by a judge advocate. It was held in two subsequent decisions (one of which was <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Dundon </span>[2004] EWCA Crim 621 (“<span class="font-italic">Dundon</span>”))<span class="font-italic"> </span>that courts martial were incompatible with the right to a fair hearing, a right protected under Art 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) and given effect to by the 1998 Act. The applicant sought leave to appeal against his conviction out of time. The Prosecution conceded that, if leave were granted, it would have no grounds for resisting the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant had suffered a substantial injustice, namely, a wrongful conviction by virtue of the Art 6(1) breach. The court rejected that argument and found that the applicant had failed to establish substantial injustice for three broad reasons. First, the court seemingly took the view that the applicant had, for the most part, not perceived himself to have suffered any substantial injustice. At no stage did he criticise the conduct of the judge advocate, and although he did not plead guilty, he did not seek to appeal against his conviction or challenge its safety until the decision in <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span> was issued (see <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>at [21]). Second, the court observed that the longer the delay in filing an appeal, the more compelling the reason had to be before it would grant leave to appeal out of time. The delay in this case was substantial, and even after the decision in <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had been rendered, there was a further delay of more than three months (see <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>at [22]–[23]). The extended delay reflected a calculated risk on the applicant’s part and also rendered a re-trial less feasible (see <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>at [23]). Third, the court stated that if the applicant were granted an extension of time to appeal, there would be no grounds for refusing to grant a similar extension of time to every other defendant who had been convicted before a court martial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The court concluded that an applicant seeking leave to appeal out of time had to show “more than that there has been a breach of Article 6 and that in consequence his conviction is unsafe; he must also show that he has suffered a substantial injury or injustice”. The applicant had failed to do so and was refused leave to appeal out of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The implications of changes in law on previous convictions were squarely dealt with in <span class="font-italic">R v Cottrell; R v Fletcher </span>[2007] 1 WLR 3262 (“<span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span>”). The court started from the premise (at [42]) that “[i]n reality, society can only operate on the basis that the courts … apply the law as it is. <span class="font-italic">The law as it may later be declared or perceived to be is irrelevant</span>” [emphasis added]. The court then cited <span class="font-italic">Mitchell </span>and <span class="font-italic">Benjafield</span> and made the following observations (at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t has for very many years, and still is, … the ‘very well established practice of this court, in a case where the conviction was entirely proper under the law as it stood at the time of trial, to grant leave to appeal against conviction out of time only where <span class="font-italic">substantial injustice</span> would otherwise be done to the defendant.’ In short, the principle is that <span class="font-italic">the defendant seeking leave to appeal out of time is generally expected to point to something more than the mere fact that the criminal law has changed, or been corrected, or developed. If the appeal is effectively based on a change of law, and nothing else, but the conviction was properly returned at the time, after a fair trial, it is unlikely that a substantial injustice occurred.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Subsequent to <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the United Kingdom Supreme Court handed down its seminal decision in <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>; <span class="font-italic">R v Ruddock</span> [2016] 2 All Er 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>ushered a sea change in the established legal position on the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>for parasitic accessorial liability. Under the prevailing law prior to <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>, if two people (“D1” and “D2” respectively) set out to commit an offence, and in the course of that joint enterprise D1 committed another offence (“crime B”), D2 would be guilty as an accessory to crime B if he foresaw the possibility that D1 might act as he did. It was held in <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span> (at [9], [10] and [83]) that the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> for parasitic accessorial liability was not foresight but an intention to assist or encourage the commission of crime B; foresight was evidence of but not synonymous with intent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mindful that <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span> would likely spur a torrent of applications by offenders who had been found to be accessories to crimes on the basis of foresight rather than intent, the Supreme Court cautioned as follows (at [100]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The effect of putting the law right is not to render invalid all convictions which were arrived at over many years by faithfully applying the law as laid down in Chan Wing-Siu and in Powell and English</span>. The error identified, of equating foresight with intent to assist rather than treating the first as evidence of the second, is important as a matter of legal principle, but <span class="font-italic">it does not follow that it will have been important on the facts to the outcome of the trial or to the safety of the conviction</span>. Moreover, where a conviction has been arrived at by faithfully applying the law as it stood at the time, it can be set aside only by seeking exceptional leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal out of time. <span class="font-italic">That court has power to grant such leave, and may do so if substantial injustice be demonstrated, but it will not do so simply because the law applied has now been declared to have been mistaken</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As anticipated, <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span> precipitated a flurry of applications for leave to appeal out of time based on the change in the law on parasitic accessorial liability. A series of these applications was addressed by the court in <span class="font-italic">R v Johnson and other appeals </span>[2017] 4 All Er 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”). The court reiterated (at [18]) the principle that an applicant who had been “properly convicted on the law as it then stood” had to establish “substantial injustice” before leave to appeal would be granted. It also observed (at [18]) that the requirement of substantial injustice “takes into account the requirement … for a court to be able to alter or correct the law upon which a large number of cases have been determined without the consequence that each of those cases can be re-opened”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Importantly, <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>suggests that whether the change in the law would have made a difference to the outcome of the concluded case in question is strongly probative of whether substantial injustice has arisen. The court stated (at [21]) that “[i]n determining whether that high threshold [of substantial injustice] has been met, the court will <span class="font-italic">primarily</span> and ordinarily have regard to the strength of the case advanced that<span class="font-italic"> the change in the law would, in fact, have made a difference</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In refusing to grant the applicants leave to appeal out of time, the court found that “there was no injustice, let alone substantial injustice” because the jury’s verdicts “would have been no different post <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>” (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [57], [83], [96], [123], [160] and [191]). In respect of two of the applicants, the court observed (at [84]) that it would ordinarily have granted them leave to challenge their convictions because their trial lawyers had reserved their position on the law on parasitic accessorial liability pending the determination of <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>. However, the court ultimately refused to grant leave because a post-<span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>direction would not have made a difference to the jury’s verdicts (see <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [83]). Put simply, the safety of those convictions was not in question. The overriding concern of the court was thus whether the change in the law would have had a bearing on the <span class="font-italic">outcome</span> of the concluded case in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 <span class="font-italic">R v Crilly</span> <span class="font-italic">(John Anthony) </span>[2018] EWCA Crim 168 (“<span class="font-italic">Crilly</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was the first instance of a court quashing a murder conviction on account of the change in the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>. In brief, the applicant and two others (including one “Flynn”) had intended to commit a burglary in what they had expected to be an empty house. When the house was found to be occupied, the applicant unsuccessfully tried to persuade Flynn to leave. The applicant then searched the property for money. During the robbery, Flynn attacked and killed the occupant. The applicant was convicted of murder and robbery even though he did not inflict any violence upon the occupant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Following the decision in <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>, the applicant sought an extension of time of 11 years and three months to appeal against his murder conviction. He contended that the trial judge had misdirected the jury and that he had been wrongly convicted of murder on the basis of foresight, not intent. The court granted exceptional leave, quashed the applicant’s murder conviction and ordered a re-trial on the murder charge (see <span class="font-italic">Crilly </span>at [42], [43] and [50]). Leave was granted primarily because it <span class="font-italic">would</span> have made a difference to the applicant’s case if the jury had been properly directed in accordance with the law as set out in <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>. The case against the applicant at trial was that he had <span class="font-italic">foreseen </span>that Flynn might cause grievous bodily harm, not that he had <span class="font-italic">intended</span> that Flynn cause such harm. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that the jury would have found the requisite intent on the applicant’s part, had it been properly directed by the trial judge (see <span class="font-italic">Crilly</span> at [42]). In the circumstances, the court held that the issuance of <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span>-compliant directions to the jury would have made a difference, that the applicant’s conviction was unsafe, and that a refusal of exceptional leave to appeal out of time would result in substantial injustice. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Crilly </span>is thus in keeping with the court’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> (at [21]) that<span class="font-italic"> </span>“[i]n determining whether that high threshold [of substantial injustice] has been met, the court will <span class="font-italic">primarily</span> and ordinarily have regard to the strength of the case advanced that <span class="font-italic">the change in the law would, in fact, have made a difference</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 While “substantial injustice” is an undoubtedly high threshold, it is sufficiently expansive to permit consideration of injustice arising not only from the impugned conviction or sentence but also from the attendant consequences thereof. <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">McGuffog (Correy Rowan)</span> [2015] EWCA Crim 1116 (“<span class="font-italic">McGuffog</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>illustrates this point well. The applicant in that case had intended to make a right turn around a mini roundabout to enter a certain lane. At the material time, one Mr Duffill had been cycling along a separate lane towards the same roundabout. Mr Duffill was visible to the applicant, who had the right of way. Assuming that Mr Duffill would stop to afford him that right of way, the applicant very slowly commenced his right turn and, in so doing, likely cut the mini roundabout slightly. Unfortunately, Mr Duffill did not stop and collided with the applicant. Mr Duffill fell off his bicycle and suffered a fatal head injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It was undisputed that the applicant did not possess a valid driving licence at the material time. The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of causing death by driving a motor vehicle on a road while unlicensed under s 3ZB of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Under the then prevailing law in <span class="font-italic">R v Williams (Jason John) </span>[2011] 1 WLR 588 (“<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>”)<span class="font-italic">, </span>an offence under s 3ZB could be made out even if the defendant’s manner of driving was faultless. The applicant received a suspended sentence and was disqualified from driving for a year. He served the suspended sentence and the disqualification period. Two years later, the United Kingdom Supreme Court overruled <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> and held in <span class="font-italic">R v Hughes </span>[2013] 1 WLR 2461 (“<span class="font-italic">Hughes</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>that in order to establish a s 3ZB offence, there had to be something open to proper criticism in the defendant’s driving and which had contributed in some more than minimal way to the death. The applicant then sought leave to appeal against his conviction retroactively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The applicant highlighted that, as a result of his conviction, it was impossible for him to obtain motor insurance for under £2,700. Furthermore, his wife was entitled to a car under a certain scheme on account of their daughter’s disability. However, he was prohibited from driving that car due to his conviction. If his conviction were quashed, the driving ban would be lifted, he would be able to obtain a full driving licence, and the motor insurance costs would be met by the scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The court noted (at [14]) that even though the applicant had already served his sentence, he “continues to suffer the remoter consequences of his conviction”. It went on to explain (at [15]) that “it is not merely the change in the law that is creating an injustice to this applicant but also the remoter consequences of it with which he continues to live”. Accordingly, the court granted the extension of time sought and quashed the applicant’s conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Crucially, there was no doubt that following the decision in <span class="font-italic">Hughes</span>, the applicant could not be said to have committed either the s 3ZB offence of which he had been convicted or any alternative offence. The Prosecution conceded that the applicant’s conviction was unsustainable in the light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Hughes</span>. Furthermore, the court explicitly observed (at [13]) that it would likely <span class="font-italic">not </span>have granted an extension of time if the applicant “could as easily have been charged with another offence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Drawing the above threads together, one may distil the following general principles:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The mere fact that the law has changed <span class="font-italic">without more</span> will not justify the court granting leave to appeal out of time. This is so even if the change in the law corrected misconceptions about the meaning of a statute or declared the previous law to be erroneous (see <span class="font-italic">Mitchell </span>at 171C and <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An applicant who relies on a change in the law in seeking leave to appeal out of time must show that he has suffered substantial injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>; <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span> at [70], [73], [76] and [78]; <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> at [18] and [21];<span class="font-italic"> Cottrell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Jogee</span> at [100]; and <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [18] and [21]). If the application is based on nothing other than a change in the law but the applicant’s conviction was properly made at the time, the court is unlikely to find that substantial injustice has arisen (see <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span> at [46] and <span class="font-italic">McGuffog</span> at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A key consideration when evaluating if an applicant has suffered substantial injustice is whether the change in the law would have made a difference to his case (see <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100]; <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [21]; and <span class="font-italic">Crilly</span> at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Refusal of leave is not limited to cases where the applicant could have been charged with a different offence had the true position in law been appreciated earlier (see <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100] and <span class="font-italic">Jawad </span>at [29]). Nonetheless, the fact that an applicant could have been charged with or convicted of a different offence is a factor that strongly militates against a finding of substantial injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Ramzan </span>at [39] and [54] and <span class="font-italic">McGuffog</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]; see also <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Applicants will be expected to act promptly and without undue delay in seeking leave to appeal out of time following a change in the law (see <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> at [23]; see also <span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan </span>at [44] and [46]).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Additionally, the court may be more circumspect about making a finding of substantial injustice if the applicant pleaded guilty or made a conscious decision not to appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>; see also <span class="font-italic">McGuffog</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The court will also consider the <span class="font-italic">extent </span>to which the law was changed. If the change in the law was far-reaching such that granting an applicant leave to appeal out of time would open the floodgates to similar applications by many other similarly situated defendants, the court may be less inclined to grant an extension of time (see <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [100] and <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [18]; see also <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ramsden</span>).<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Although most of the relevant English authorities concern the review of <span class="font-italic">convictions</span>, the same standard of “substantial injustice” should and does apply to the review of <span class="font-italic">sentences</span>. This is readily apparent from <span class="font-italic">R v Howe (Paul Alfred)</span> [2009] EWCA Crim 2707 (“<span class="font-italic">Howe</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which two appellants sought leave to appeal against their sentences of imprisonment for public protection (“IPP”). IPP sentences (which were abolished in 2012) were designed to ensure that dangerous offenders remained in custody for as long as they presented a risk to society. An offender sentenced to IPP had to first serve his or her minimum term of imprisonment; thereafter, the offender would only be released upon satisfying the Parole Board that he or she no longer posed a risk to society. The minimum term would typically be fixed at half the length of the determinate sentence that would have been imposed for the offence in question. Both appellants had been sentenced to IPP for downloading, possessing and/or accessing obscene photographs of children. The first appellant was sentenced to a minimum specified term of two and a half years, based on a determinate term of five years. The second appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of six months, ostensibly based on a determinate sentence of a year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 IPP sentences would only be imposed if it was shown that <span class="font-italic">the offender’s re-offending </span>would cause serious harm. After the appellants were sentenced, it was held in a separate decision that the link between the downloading of obscene images of children and the harm that children might suffer was too remote to satisfy that requirement. The appellants subsequently sought to set aside their sentences. The court applied the test of “substantial injustice” and found (at [4], [5] and [11]) that the test was satisfied. The first appellant remained in custody and, although the second appellant had been released, he remained on a long licence liable to recall. The court therefore quashed the IPP sentences and left the original determinate sentences undisturbed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The courts have also consistently applied the yardstick of “substantial injustice” to cases involving the review of confiscation orders, even though confiscation orders are not sentences in the strict sense: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Jawad </span>at [29] and [30]; <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Meghrabi (Diana) </span>[2014] EWCA Crim 197 at [9], [11], [12] and [15]; and <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Bestel and others </span>[2013] EWCA Crim 1305 (“<span class="font-italic">Bestel</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]–[15], [23], [24], [31], [73] and [79]. There is thus no reason why reviews of convictions and sentences should not be governed by the same standard and considerations. Even in an application for review of a sentence, the starting point remains that the matter was determined on its merits and decided on the basis of the law as it then stood. Accordingly, whether a review application concerns a conviction or a sentence, something more than a mere change in the law or a mere error is required to displace the earlier decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Aside from the foregoing point of principle, there are also practical considerations that call for the high threshold of “substantial injustice” to be applied to reviews of sentences. In common with many jurisdictions, most criminal matters in Singapore are disposed of by way of guilty pleas rather than trials. Consequently, “[n]ew rules of sentencing procedure … threaten to disrupt far more cases than new rules of trial procedure” (see <span class="font-italic">Scott</span> at 181). The court’s reluctance to upset final judgments therefore cannot be any less pronounced where reviews of sentences are concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Having surveyed the English authorities, we consider that an appellate court may only reopen an earlier decision, whether pursuant to its inherent or statutory power of review, when it has been presented with new material that gives rise to a <span class="font-italic">powerful probability</span> that <span class="font-italic">substantial injustice</span> has arisen in the criminal matter in respect of which the earlier decision was made. This proposed threshold borrows the requirement of “substantial injustice” found in English authorities such as <span class="font-italic">Jogee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>, and is aligned with the well-established threshold of “serious injustice” that must be met whenever our courts’ revisionary powers are invoked (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yang Yin </span>[2015] 2 SLR 78 at [25]). We add that the same test of substantial injustice should be adopted when deciding whether to grant leave to appeal out of time. As we are presently concerned with “change in the law” cases, the “new material” in question will likely take the form of new legal arguments based on changes in the law brought about by a judicial decision issued after the appellate court had rendered the decision that is sought to be reviewed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The test of substantial injustice comprises two essential components. Not only must an <span class="font-italic">injustice</span> have arisen, but the injustice must also be <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>to warrant the court’s exercise of its power of review.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An <span class="font-italic">injustice</span> may be said to have arisen in one of two ways:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Where an applicant seeks to set aside his <span class="font-italic">conviction</span>, an injustice will only have arisen if the new material strikes at the <span class="font-italic">soundness</span> of the <span class="font-italic">conviction</span> in a <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> way.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Where an applicant seeks to challenge his <span class="font-italic">sentence</span>, an injustice will only have arisen if the new material shows that the earlier decision was based on a <span class="font-italic">fundamental misapprehension of the law</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An injustice may be said to be <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>under the following circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) An applicant may establish substantial injustice if the new material points to a <span class="font-italic">powerful probability</span> that his <span class="font-italic">conviction</span> is <span class="font-italic">unsound</span> and if the facts do not disclose any other offence of comparable gravity.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Where the new material shows that the earlier decision was based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law, any resulting injustice will only be considered substantial if the said misapprehension had a <span class="font-italic">significant bearing</span> <span class="font-italic">on the sentence imposed</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Our approach is informed by the considerations set out in the English authorities (see [65] above) and comports with both s 394J of the CPC and our decision in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>. The language of “powerful probability” and “a fundamental misapprehension of the law” can be found in ss 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 394J(7) respectively while the requirement of “substantial injustice” is mirrored in the substantive requirement of a “miscarriage of justice” in ss 394J(2) and 394J(5). Furthermore, since s 394J codifies the requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, it follows that our approach is also consistent with that decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The alignment of s 394J of the CPC, our decision in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>and the approach that we have set out at [71] above reinforces our point that the substance of any review application is typically unaffected by an applicant’s choice of remedial avenue (see [30] above). Hence, a mere change in the law <span class="font-italic">without more </span>will not constitute sufficient material justifying either the grant of leave (under s 394H of the CPC) to make a review application or the exercise of the court’s inherent power of review. In this connection, we echo the well-established position in English law that the court will not reopen a concluded decision for no other reason than that the law has changed, even if the change in the law declared the previous legal position to be wrong or rectified misconceptions about the meaning of a statute (see [65(a)] above). Instead, it is of paramount importance that an applicant demonstrates that he has suffered substantial injustice (see [65(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We begin by elaborating on the requirement that an <span class="font-italic">injustice </span>has arisen. Where an applicant seeks to set aside his conviction, an injustice will only have arisen if the new material strikes at the <span class="font-italic">soundness</span> of the <span class="font-italic">conviction</span> in a <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> way. If, in the light of a subsequent change in the law, it appears that the applicant has, quite simply, not committed <span class="font-italic">an</span><span class="font-italic">y</span> offence, then there would be an air of unreality in insisting that he nonetheless be held guilty. Where the new material strikes at the soundness of the conviction in a fundamental way, the change in the law would likely have made a difference to the outcome of the applicant’s case, which is the court’s overarching consideration when applying the “substantial injustice” test (see [65(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Our approach mirrors that adopted in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kim Han</span>, in which several petitioners sought to have their convictions set aside by way of a criminal revision. In allowing the petition, Yong Pung How CJ observed (at [10]) that while there was no clear test of what amounted to “serious injustice”, it could not be disputed that such injustice would exist when a person had been convicted despite the obvious absence of an essential component of the offence in question. It is for the same reason that the court granted the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span> exceptional leave to appeal against his conviction out of time (see [36]–[39] above). The court candidly acknowledged (at 171G) that, were it to decide otherwise, it would have the “totally unreal task” of determining the correct sentence for “<span class="font-italic">an offence which had not been committed</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 New material that strikes at the soundness of a conviction in a fundamental way must, in essence, give rise to a powerful probability that <span class="font-italic">no</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>offence<span class="font-italic"> </span>has in fact been committed. Such new material will typically arise in the light of subsequent changes in the law as to the <span class="font-italic">constituent elements of an offence </span>and/or the <span class="font-italic">proper interpretation of statutory provisions </span>that generate criminal liability. The requirement that the new material must relate to the fundamental propriety of a conviction serves to sift out unmeritorious applications that seek to re-litigate matters based on subsequent changes in the law that are only tangentially relevant to the conviction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The need for the new material to strike at the soundness of a conviction in a fundamental way also explains the decision in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span>. It will be recalled that the application in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> arose following decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>which held that naval courts martial were incompatible with the right to a fair trial protected under Art 6(1) of the ECHR. In <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span>, the court held (at [89]) that the judge advocate’s status as a naval officer meant that he was not institutionally independent of the Prosecution and accordingly quashed the defendant’s conviction. However, the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>unsuccessfully relied on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to challenge his conviction. In our view, what distinguishes <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span> from cases such as <span class="font-italic">Mitchell</span> and <span class="font-italic">Crilly</span> is the fact that the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>had unquestionably committed an offence – he challenged his conviction <span class="font-italic">only</span> on grounds of procedural legality. Although the conviction in <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span> was set aside on this basis, it bears reiterating that the proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger</span>, unlike those in <span class="font-italic">Dundon</span>, had already been concluded. This meant that the overriding interest in <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>was finality; something more than a procedural error was needed to displace that interest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Matters of procedural fairness (or criminal procedure) therefore do not typically go towards the soundness of a conviction in the sense of establishing that an offence has not in fact been committed. In any event, we take the view that they are more properly classified as potential breaches of natural justice (see s 394J(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC and <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [69]). We also note that an applicant will likely be unable to demonstrate that such a change in the law would have yielded a different outcome, which is a critical element of the “substantial injustice” test (see [65(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We next consider instances where an applicant seeks to challenge his sentence. In such cases, an injustice may only be said to have arisen if the new material shows that the earlier decision was based on a <span class="font-italic">fundamental misapprehension of the law</span>. The reason for this is relatively straightforward: the courts commonly lay down new sentencing guidelines and sentencing frameworks, and it would be alarming if every new sentencing framework could unravel all previous sentencing decisions for the offence in question (see [65(f)] above). As an example, the sentencing framework for rape offences laid down in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>would not suffice as grounds on which an applicant may seek to have his sentence reviewed. Individuals who were convicted for rape offences under the sentencing framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<span class="font-italic">NF</span>”), which was the applicable sentencing framework for rape offences before <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>was decided, cannot be said to have been convicted based on a fundamental misapprehension of the law. The impetus for the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework was principally the desire to devise a comprehensive and conceptually coherent sentencing framework for rape offences (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [12(a)] and [12(b)]). Even though the <span class="font-italic">NF </span>framework was eventually replaced, it cannot be said to have been founded on a misapprehension of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 An example of a fundamental misapprehension of the law might be the converse of what transpired in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Nasir bin Amer </span><span class="font-italic">Hamsah v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 842 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Nasir</span>”). Until that decision was rendered, life imprisonment was understood to mean 20 years’ imprisonment. The basis for this understanding was s 57 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 PC”), which provided that “[in] calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for 20 years”. In <span class="font-italic">Abdul Nasir</span>, however, we highlighted (at [30]) that on a proper construction of s 57, life imprisonment ought to be equated with 20 years’ imprisonment <span class="font-italic">only</span> when calculating <span class="font-italic">fractions</span> of terms of punishment. Having considered the legislative intent underlying offences that were punishable with life imprisonment, the plain meaning of the term “life” as well as s 45 of the 1985 PC, we concluded (at [32]) that life imprisonment ought to be understood as a sentence of imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted offender’s natural life. Of course, the change in the law occasioned by <span class="font-italic">Abdul Nasir </span>did not give rise to any substantial injustice because the previous erroneous understanding had worked to the advantage of offenders. But had an error of such a nature had the opposite effect such that offenders had previously been sentenced to more than what they should have been, this could arguably be said to be a fundamental misapprehension of the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is, however, insufficient that an injustice has arisen in the criminal matter in respect of which the earlier decision was made. That injustice must be <span class="font-italic">substantial</span>. Such a rigorous standard accords due recognition to the fact that the impugned decision has already undergone at least two rounds of independent scrutiny – once by the court exercising original criminal jurisdiction and another by the appellate court. The requirement that the injustice be “substantial” also better distinguishes the function of an appeal, which is the correction of error, from that of a review, which is the correction of miscarriages of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [49] and [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Where an applicant successfully establishes a powerful probability that his conviction is unsound and no comparable offence has been committed, he will have established substantial injustice. After all, “[t]here is no doubt that the conviction of an innocent person is an injustice – perhaps <span class="font-italic">the </span>ultimate substantive injustice, proof of which would justify reopening a concluded criminal appeal” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>at [64]). Conversely, this means that even where an applicant demonstrates that his conviction is unsustainable, he will nevertheless have failed to establish <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>injustice if he could have been charged with or convicted of other offences of comparable gravity despite the change in the law (see [65(d)] above and <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span> at [39] and [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Where the impugned decision is a decision on sentence, any injustice (arising from a fundamental misapprehension of the law) will only be considered substantial if the said misapprehension had a significant bearing on the sentence imposed (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Howe </span>at [66]–[67] above). Sentencing involves an exercise of discretion and potential adjustments to a sentence that are of marginal significance cannot justify interference with the sentencing court’s exercise of discretion (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22]). Moreover, given that an appellate court will only entertain an appeal against sentence where (among other things) the sentence is <span class="font-italic">manifestly</span> excessive or <span class="font-italic">manifestly</span> inadequate (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [82]), the threshold for intervention by an appellate court in a <span class="font-italic">review application</span> cannot be any less stringent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 We conclude this section by making three observations. First, there can be no question that even in cases where it is subsequently found that substantial injustice has arisen following a change in the law, those cases were correctly decided in accordance with the prevailing law as it was understood at the time. Under the approach that we have set out above, however, the <span class="font-italic">legal correctness </span>of a decision at the time that it was made is tempered by the <span class="font-italic">overall justice </span>of the case. In other words, while a matter might have been properly decided in line with the then prevailing jurisprudence, the “substantial injustice” test effectively engages considerations of prejudice to the applicant or the unconscionability of tying him to the old legal position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In this vein, we stress that applicants should act with all due urgency should they be of the view that a change in the law affords them strong grounds for seeking a review of their convictions and/or sentences (see [65(e)] above). The longer the delay between the change in the law and the filing of the review application, the more it can presumptively be said that the applicant has deliberately chosen not to challenge the earlier decision against him, and the more difficult it will likely be for him to prove that he has suffered substantial injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Ballinger </span>at [22]–[23]; see also [50] above). Hence, where an applicant has, by his wilful and persistent inaction, assumed the risk of any prejudice that he may suffer, finality interests should assume priority. Of course, a court confronted with this issue will have to consider the length of time that has passed from when the applicant ought reasonably to have known of the opportunity to seek a review and also the reasons advanced to explain any delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, our approach is consonant with the cases in which an appellate court revisited an earlier decision following a change in the law. In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, for example, we exercised our statutory power of review under s 394I for the first time as there was a powerful probability that the applicant had been wrongfully convicted on a capital charge when the necessary elements of the offence had not been made out. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ong Say Kiat </span>[2017] 5 SLR 946 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Say Kiat</span>”), the court granted the respondent leave to appeal out of time on account of the substantial injustice that he had suffered by being imprisoned for a significantly longer duration than he otherwise would have been. The court intimated that the disproportionately heavy sentence had been imposed on the respondent pursuant to a fundamental misapprehension of the law. We consider both of these cases in greater detail at [92]–[95] and [97]–[100] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Third, and most importantly, the criteria that must be fulfilled before an appellate court may review an earlier decision following a change in the law are exacting and are intended to forestall endless re-litigation (see [65(f)] above). The stringent requirements that we have set out above cumulatively serve as a filter to ensure that only meritorious applications in which there is a powerful probability that substantial injustice has arisen will be entertained. Where such applications are concerned, “[t]he floodgates argument should not be allowed to wash away both the guilty and the innocent” (see <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong</span> at [15]). The possibility of error does not however mean that we should disregard the interests in certainty and repose. Indeed, those interests animate the strict requirements that must be met in order to establish substantial injustice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In this connection, we note that it will be exceedingly rare for applicants to successfully establish substantial injustice based on the change in the law occasioned by <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>. This is for several reasons. First, in capital cases or cases in which the Prosecution has reduced the weight of the drugs stipulated in the charge to an amount falling just short of the capital threshold, the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice” will make little to no difference to the eventual sentence imposed. We reiterate that in so far as reviews of sentences are concerned, substantial injustice will only be established if it is shown that, among other things, the change in the law would have had a significant bearing on the sentence imposed (see [83] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, in cases where accused persons elect to plead guilty, the Prosecution will usually proceed on the cannabis charge and apply for the cannabis mixture charge (in respect of the same block(s) of cannabis-related plant material) to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. Where the proceeded charges and the TIC charges pertain to the same block(s) of cannabis-related plant material, the courts tend not to accord the TIC charges significant aggravating weight. <span class="font-italic">Abdul Karim </span>is a case in point. The appellant’s appeal against sentence was dismissed because the High Court judge had not regarded the TIC charge (which concerned cannabis mixture) as aggravating, among other reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Third, any application for us to reopen a concluded decision based on the change in the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> essentially invites us to retrospectively alter one part of the factual matrix – in other words, to assume that the position in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> was already the applicable law when the case at hand was decided. The difficulty, however, is that any retrospective view of events must also take into account the full range of factors, including how the Prosecution might have acted had it appreciated the legal position in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> at the material time. It seems to us that in the vast majority of cases pre-dating <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> where offenders had been charged pursuant to the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice” and so convicted, the Prosecution could have easily proceeded on charges <span class="font-italic">other</span> than the impugned cannabis mixture charges, such that there would have been no appreciable difference in the aggregate sentence imposed. This is a point of considerable importance, which we elaborate on at [116]–[119] and [133] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The avenues by which the court may revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having addressed <span class="font-italic">when</span> a court may revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law, the question that follows is <span class="font-italic">how </span>a court may do so. In our view, there are three mechanisms at the court’s disposal. First, where a decision has not been appealed against previously, an appellate court may grant an offender leave to appeal out of time. Second, where an appeal against a lower court’s decision has already been disposed of, the appellate court may either exercise its inherent power to review the concluded appeal or grant the offender leave (under s 394H of the CPC) to make a review application. Third, the Court of Appeal may exercise its power to review any matter on its own motion if so warranted. We proceed to discuss each of these avenues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Leave to appeal out of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Where a decision has not previously been the subject of an appeal, an appellate court may grant an offender leave to appeal out of time. This course of action was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Ong Say Kiat</span>. The respondent in that case (“Ong”) had been sentenced in 2014 to five years’ corrective training (“CT”) for an offence of theft in dwelling with common intention. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2016] 5 SLR 936 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was handed down some 21 months later. The Prosecution then filed a criminal revision asking that the sentence of five years’ CT imposed on Ong be set aside. The Prosecution contended that in the light of <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the<span class="font-italic"> </span>sentence of five years’ CT appeared to be unduly disproportionate compared to the likely term of regular imprisonment that would otherwise have been imposed, even though the imposition of CT was justified given the prevailing jurisprudence at the time of Ong’s sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The court held (at [32] and [37]) that the case properly called for the exercise of its appellate rather than revisionary jurisdiction. It further held (at [34]) that the factual and legal substratum that underlay the <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee </span>sentencing approach to CT had already existed at the time of Ong’s sentencing. The sentencing approach in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee </span>was devised because of several changes in the operating conditions which affected the sentence of CT and which had <span class="font-italic">already </span>taken effect at the time of Ong’s sentencing. Accordingly, the court held (at [34]) that the sentence of five years’ CT imposed on Ong was “wrong in law” and manifestly excessive, notwithstanding the prevailing jurisprudence pre-<span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 What is of note is the court’s finding (at [33]) that the law laid down in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee </span>ought to have applied at the time of Ong’s sentencing because “the relevant factual and <span class="font-italic">legal</span> <span class="font-italic">matrix</span>” [emphasis added] was the same in both cases. Reading between the lines, it appears that the court was intimating that Ong’s sentence was based on a <span class="font-italic">fundamental misapprehension of the law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [71(a)(ii)] and [79] above). Moreover, the injustice that Ong had suffered was doubtlessly substantial. By the time the criminal revision was heard, and without taking into account his time spent in remand, Ong had spent over two and a half years in prison (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Say Kiat </span>at [38]). Even after considering his antecedents, the likely imprisonment term for his offence would have been only nine months <span class="font-italic">at the very most </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Ong Say Kiat </span>at [13]). Given the substantial injustice that had arisen, the court granted Ong leave to appeal out of time, treated the appeal as having been heard, allowed the appeal, and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of time already served (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Say Kiat </span>at [44] and [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Notwithstanding the fact that approximately 21 months had elapsed between Ong’s sentencing and the decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yeow Kee</span>, the court’s decision to grant Ong leave to appeal out of time is unimpeachable. As the English Court of Appeal expressed in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> (at [21]), “[i]t is not … material to consider the length of time that has elapsed. <span class="font-italic">If there was a substantial injustice, it is irrelevant whether that injustice occurred a short time or a long time ago</span>. It is and remains an injustice.” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court’s statutory and inherent powers of review</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It goes without saying that when a case has already been heard and disposed of by an appellate court, the dissatisfied litigant is precluded from seeking a second appeal. Instead, such a litigant may have recourse to either the appellate court’s statutory power of review under s 394I of the CPC or this court’s inherent power of review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>was the first (and thus far, only) instance of a review application that was successfully brought under s 394I of the CPC. The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>claimed trial to a capital charge of importing not less than 40.22g of diamorphine. The trial judge held that the applicant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA and acquitted him of the capital charge. The trial judge instead convicted the applicant of a non-capital charge of attempting to import a Class C controlled drug and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane. The Prosecution’s appeal against the trial judge’s decision was allowed in CA/CCA 20/2017 (“CCA 20/2017”). We held that the trial judge erred in finding that the s 18(2) presumption had been rebutted and convicted the applicant of the capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The applicant sought a review of our decision in CCA 20/2017, pursuant to s 394I of the CPC. The application was brought on the basis of the following new legal arguments (“the Legal Arguments”): (a) applying our holdings in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 254 (a decision issued after CCA 20/2017 had been decided) to the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, the s 18(2) presumption should not encompass wilful blindness; and (b) the Prosecution could not have invoked the s 18(2) presumption because its case at the trial was not one of actual knowledge but, at most, one of wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We allowed the application and exercised our statutory power of review as the Legal Arguments provided sufficient material on which it might be concluded that there had been a miscarriage of justice in CCA 20/2017 (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [44], [49] and [50]). We held (at [56]) that the knowledge presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA was confined to actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs in an accused person’s possession and did not encompass knowledge of matters to which an accused person had been wilfully blind. As the Prosecution’s case <span class="font-italic">at the trial</span> was that the applicant had been wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs in question, it was not entitled to rely on the s 18(2) presumption (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [105], [109] and [121]). Furthermore, the applicant had not been wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs in the first place (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [123]–[125]). Accordingly, we set aside his conviction on the capital charge and reinstated the conviction on the reduced charge (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [133]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 It should be noted that we exercised our statutory power of review in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>even though the s 18(2) presumption <span class="font-italic">did</span> encompass the doctrine of wilful blindness under the law pre-<span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>(see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Masoud Rahimi bin </span><span class="font-italic">Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 257 and <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1). In other words, the applicant had been properly convicted under the law as it then stood. However, <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is readily reconcilable with the approach that we have laid out at [70]–[71] above. In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, we held (at [56]) that only actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs in an accused person’s possession could be presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA. However, the Prosecution’s case at the trial was one of wilful blindness even though it had invoked the s 18(2) presumption. On appeal, the Prosecution instead ran its case on the basis of actual knowledge, and the Defence did not pick up on this change of position. The court’s decision on conviction in CCA 20/2017 was <span class="font-italic">premised </span>on the holding that the applicant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [121]). But, by reason of the Prosecution’s change of position on appeal, the fact and significance of which were not appreciated at the time, the Prosecution had in fact failed to establish the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>for the offence of drug importation <span class="font-italic">at </span><span class="font-italic">the trial</span>. In the circumstances, there was a powerful probability that an injustice (or, to use the language of ss 394J(2) and 394J(5) of the CPC, a miscarriage of justice) had arisen in the sense that the soundness of the applicant’s conviction on the capital charge was doubtful. This injustice was unquestionably “substantial” since it was a matter of life and death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Aside from s 394I of the CPC, an applicant may also seek to have an earlier decision of this court reopened pursuant to our inherent power of review. Although this power was expressly set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, we ultimately declined to exercise our inherent power of review in that case.

Although s 60D of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) sets out the matters that the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal consists of, the SCJA does not expressly state when the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in a criminal appeal ends. To adopt the reasoning of Chan CJ in <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong </span>at [16] (with which we agreed in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> at [77(a)]), in the absence of any statutory provision providing for the termination of its jurisdiction in a criminal appeal, there is no reason why the Court of Appeal should circumscribe its own judicial power to preclude itself from reviewing any matter on its own motion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 That this power should not be lightly exercised is perhaps most evident from the fact that it has yet to be exercised by this court. The role of the court is to adjudicate disputes that are before it; a court that is too eager to review matters on its own motion not only risks encroaching upon the territory of the Public Prosecutor, who has sole responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions, but also risks jeopardising its perceived legitimacy. We therefore leave it to a suitable occasion in the future to discuss the precise contours of the Court of Appeal’s power to review any matter on its own motion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Having considered the circumstances in which an applicant may seek to reopen a concluded decision, as well as the avenues by which he may do so, we now deal squarely with the applications before us.

Prior to the hearing, the respondent in CM 12, Shanmugam a/l Applanaidu (“Shanmugam”), objected to the Prosecution’s withdrawal of CM 12. His counsel subsequently informed us at the hearing that he had since discussed the matter with Shanmugam and that Shanmugam, too, gave his unreserved consent to the withdrawal of CM 12. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Shalni, the respondent in CM 14, initially consented to the withdrawal of the application. However, her counsel, Mr Amarick Gill (“Mr Gill”), indicated at the hearing that she had changed her position. Mr Gill submitted that if Shalni’s cannabis mixture charge were set aside, that could potentially reduce her aggregate sentence by five years (see [132] below). On that basis, he urged us to deny the Prosecution’s withdrawal of CM 14. As we stated at the hearing, however, there was simply no juridical basis for us to stop the Prosecution from withdrawing the application (see [5] above). Mr Gill thereafter indicated that he reserved the right to file an application on Shalni’s behalf to seek substantially the same relief as that originally sought by the Prosecution in CM 14. We observed that it was open to him to do so but that the merits and likely success of any such application fell to be considered against the high threshold of substantial injustice which we outlined then and which we have explored in detail in these grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 That left us with Suventher, the respondent in CM 13, who objected to the withdrawal of the application. Although he accepted that <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> did not “automatically” apply with retroactive effect, he contended that there had been a “miscarriage of justice”. He argued that the Prosecution had erred in preferring separate charges involving cannabis and cannabis mixture against him, that the High Court judge had erred in treating the TIC charge (which pertained to cannabis mixture) as an aggravating factor in sentencing, and that we had erred in affirming the sentence imposed by the High Court judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Having set out the parties’ respective positions, we now examine the implications of <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> on each of the four cases out of which the present applications arise. Before doing so, we note that Pang and Shanmugam unreservedly consented to the withdrawal of CM 11 and CM 12 respectively. We are nonetheless cognisant that this is the first time that we have expressly considered the threshold for invoking the court’s revisionary powers based on a subsequent change in the law. Hence, and as we informed the respondents at the hearing, if it appears to any of them, after having perused these grounds of decision, that there is a basis for invoking the court’s powers of review or revision, it remains open to them to do so. That said, we reiterate once again that the applicable threshold of substantial injustice is a very high bar that will not commonly be crossed (see [6] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CM 11</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Pang, the respondent in CM 11, pleaded guilty to three charges under the MDA.

The aggregate imprisonment term imposed was thus 25 years. The aggregate sentence of caning was limited to 24 strokes, pursuant to ss 328(1) and 328(6) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Before subsequently seeking leave to withdraw CM 11, the Prosecution sought an extension of time to appeal against Pang’s sentence on account of his conviction on the third charge. The first and third charges (which are highlighted in the table at [113] above) related to the same four blocks of cannabis-related plant material. As mentioned at [108] above, Pang did not object to the withdrawal of CM 11.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In our judgment, the facts did not show that there was a powerful probability that substantial injustice would arise if the Prosecution was granted leave to withdraw CM 11. It was true that Pang could not be said to have committed some other offence in respect of the cannabis mixture charge (see <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>; <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span> at [39] and [54]; and <span class="font-italic">McGuffog</span> at [13]). However, one could not blindly ignore the fact that if the cannabis mixture charge was disregarded, the Prosecution could have proceeded with a different combination of three charges – or indeed, on all five remaining charges – such as would yield <span class="font-italic">at least </span>the same aggregate sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. In our view, this was a strong factor that militated against a finding of substantial injustice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 We highlight that the courts <span class="font-italic">have </span>considered how the Prosecution might have otherwise proceeded when assessing whether substantial injustice has been established in “change in the law” cases. In <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span>, for example, the first defendant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault for having had sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl on two occasions. Subsequently, the House of Lords held that where the Prosecution only relied upon evidence of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16, it could not charge an accused person with indecent assault if 12 months or longer had elapsed since the alleged sexual intercourse. The first defendant then sought leave to appeal against his conviction out of time on the basis that he had been charged with indecent assault more than 12 months after the acts of sexual intercourse had occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The English Court of Appeal refused to grant leave. The court emphatically stated (at [59]) that “[i]t would be a <span class="font-italic">manifest injustice</span> to the complainant if [the first defendant] were able to <span class="font-italic">take advantage of that part of the change of law which suited him, without having to accept the inevitable consequences of the process which would have applied to this case if the erroneous practice had been recognised earlier, and the necessary adaptations to it adopted</span>” [emphasis added]. In addition to the acts of sexual intercourse, the complainant had also alleged that the first defendant had touched her breasts. Although the first defendant was convicted on the two counts of indecent assault that were based on the acts of sexual intercourse, the jury could not agree on the separate count of indecent assault arising from the allegation that he had touched the complainant’s breasts. In the light of the first defendant’s convictions, the Prosecution did not pursue the count of indecent assault on which the jury was unable to agree (see <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span> at [12]). Clearly, if the Prosecution had appreciated the subsequent change in the law earlier, it could and would have pursued the remaining count of indecent assault. As put by the court in <span class="font-italic">Bestel</span> (at [24]), “[i]n <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span> the [first defendant] would have been convicted of sexual assault founded purely upon acts committed before the act of unlawful sexual intercourse on which the charge had been laid”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It was hence an eminently relevant consideration in our context that the Prosecution could and likely would have proceeded on at least three out of the five remaining charges against Pang, such as would yield either the same or a similar aggregate sentence. The fourth and fifth charges carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment while the sixth charge attracted a mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment. In addition, the fourth, fifth and sixth charges all carried a mandatory minimum of five strokes of the cane. This meant that any combination of three proceeded charges would have resulted in an aggregate imprisonment term of 23 or 25 years as well as 24 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution could also have opted to proceed on <span class="font-italic">more </span>than three proceeded charges, in which case Pang might have received an even harsher aggregate sentence. Another possibility was that the Prosecution might have proceeded on a capital charge against Pang. In this regard, we noted that the first charge was initially a capital charge of importing not less than 915.6g of cannabis. Much like the first defendant in <span class="font-italic">Cottrell</span>, we saw no reason why Pang ought to be allowed to take advantage of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> without having to take into account how the Prosecution might have acted under a different set of circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 For these reasons, we concluded that no substantial injustice had arisen in Pang’s matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CM 12</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The respondent in CM 12, Shanmugam, claimed trial to two charges of drug importation. The subject matter of both charges was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first charge: six blocks containing not less than 1,969.3g of cannabis; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second charge: six blocks containing not less than 3,584.2g of cannabis mixture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Both charges related to the same six blocks of cannabis-related plant material. The High Court judge found Shanmugam guilty of both charges and convicted him accordingly. As the judge found that Shanmugam was a courier and as the Prosecution extended a Certificate of Substantive Assistance, the judge exercised his discretion under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane per charge. The aggregate sentence imposed was thus life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. Shanmugam appealed against his sentence but subsequently withdrew his appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 By way of CM 12, the Prosecution originally sought an extension of time to appeal against the sentence imposed on Shanmugam. Before us, Shanmugam consented to the withdrawal of CM 12 (see [108] above). It was clear beyond peradventure to us that any appeal against Shanmugam’s sentence would be hopeless. As Shanmugam was convicted of importing a capital amount of not less than 1,969.3g of cannabis, life imprisonment was the lowest possible sentence that could have been imposed under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. Disregarding the cannabis mixture charge would have made no difference to the sentence of life imprisonment that was imposed in relation to the cannabis charge. The 15 strokes of caning imposed on Shanmugam would also have been administered by now, given that he withdrew his appeal against sentence in November 2017 (see ss 327(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 327(2) of the CPC). Accordingly, setting aside the cannabis mixture charge would not have made any difference at all in Shanmugam’s case, and it followed that no substantial injustice had arisen. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CM 13</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Suventher, the respondent in CM 13, pleaded guilty to a single charge of importing two blocks containing not less than 499.9g of cannabis. Another charge was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The TIC charge concerned the same two blocks of cannabis-related plant material, save that they were alleged to contain not less than 999.9g of cannabis mixture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The High Court judge found Suventher guilty of the proceeded charge and convicted him accordingly. Although the judge acknowledged that the proceeded charge and the TIC charge pertained to the same blocks of cannabis-related plant material, he nonetheless found that the substantial weight of the cannabis mixture in the TIC charge was an aggravating factor that warranted an enhancement in sentence (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Suventher Shanmugam </span>[2016] SGHC 178 at [25]–[26]). The judge ultimately sentenced Suventher to 23 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 115 (“<span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”), we dismissed Suventher’s appeal against sentence. We<span class="font-italic"> </span>also laid down sentencing guidelines for the unauthorised import or trafficking of cannabis and held (at [21] and [29]) that the sentence imposed in such cases ought to be proportional to the quantity of drugs in the offender’s possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In CM 13, the Prosecution initially sought to have Suventher’s TIC charge (which pertained to cannabis mixture) set aside and urged us to exercise our inherent power to review our decision in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. At the hearing, Suventher initially protested against the Prosecution’s withdrawal of CM 13. He contended that the TIC charge ought to be set aside and argued that this would in turn reduce his sentence for the proceeded charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 We found Suventher’s argument to be wholly devoid of merit. It will be recalled that he pleaded guilty to a charge of importing not less than 499.9g of cannabis. Having regard to the sentencing guidelines in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the appropriate indicative starting sentence would have been 29 years’ imprisonment, given that the quantity of cannabis involved was at the very highest end of the weight range. There was nothing remarkable about his culpability to warrant an adjustment to the indicative starting sentence; nor were there any other aggravating factors or any valid mitigating factors. In other words, and as we made clear to Suventher at the hearing of these applications, he could have been sentenced to 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane based on the sheer weight of the cannabis stated in the proceeded charge <span class="font-italic">alone</span>, even if the TIC charge had not been accorded any aggravating weight. Indeed, we expressly noted in <span class="font-italic">Suventher</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [41] that “having regard to the guidelines … as the charge was for a quantity of drugs that was at the very top of the weight range, the sentence could in fact have been much more severe”. After we explained this to Suventher at the hearing, he no longer maintained his objections to the Prosecution’s withdrawal of CM 13.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In summary, given that the sentence imposed on Suventher was very much on the lenient side, it was patently untenable for him to argue that he had suffered <span class="font-italic">any</span> injustice, let alone substantial injustice, by virtue of the TIC charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CM 14</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Shalni, the respondent in CM 14, pleaded guilty to three charges of drug importation relating to the same transaction.

Shalni’s appeal against sentence was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The second and third charges (which are highlighted in the table at [130] above) related to the same block of cannabis-related plant material. CM 14 concerned the integrity of Shalni’s conviction on the second charge. The Prosecution originally applied to set aside Shalni’s conviction and sentence in respect of the second charge and invited us to exercise our inherent power to review our earlier decision to dismiss Shalni’s appeal against sentence. As earlier mentioned at [109] above, Mr Gill submitted that we ought to reconsider our dismissal of Shalni’s appeal against sentence. According to him, if the Prosecution had erred in preferring the cannabis mixture charge, then there would have been only two proceeded charges. Pursuant to s 306(2) of the CPC, the sentences for those two charges (namely, the first and third charges) might but need not have run consecutively. Mr Gill argued that had those two sentences been ordered to run concurrently, Shalni would have been sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment term of 25 rather than 30 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As we made clear to Mr Gill, the difficulty in trying to undo Shalni’s conviction on the cannabis mixture charge, which was properly rendered at the time, was that we would inevitably have had to consider how the Prosecution might have proceeded had it appreciated the legal position in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> then. Were we to consider only the first part of that equation and ignore the realities of how the Prosecution might have otherwise proceeded, we would in effect be selectively altering only one part of the factual matrix on hindsight. The first charge against Shalni was originally framed as a capital charge involving more than 15g of diamorphine. Had the Prosecution been earlier apprised of the fact that it could not have proceeded with the cannabis mixture charge, it might well have exercised its prosecutorial discretion differently in deciding whether to reduce the capital charge. With respect, it seemed to us that the perspective that Mr Gill put forward on his client’s behalf did not take into account the full range of factors relevant to the reconstruction of past events. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons canvassed at [90] and [116]–[119] above, we were of the view that there was no<span class="font-italic"> </span>powerful probability that substantial injustice had arisen in Shalni’s matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, as the Prosecution quite fairly pointed out in the PP’s Letter, they had engaged in the “dual charging practice” pursuant to our decision in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Manogaran s/o R Ramu </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 390 (“<span class="font-italic">Manogaran</span>”), in which we held (at [43]) that the Prosecution could prefer dual charges of cannabis and cannabis mixture arising from the same compressed block of cannabis-related plant material. <span class="font-italic">Manogaran</span> was good law for nearly 24 years, until we departed from that established legal position in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>. If the principle of finality is to have any real significance, then the Prosecution, law enforcement authorities and convicted offenders alike must be entitled to the belief that cases that were concluded pre-<span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> have been set at rest for good.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For these reasons, we were satisfied that Shalni had not suffered substantial injustice on account of her conviction and sentence for the cannabis mixture charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The finality embodied in every judgment of the court is what instils in us the confidence that justice has been done and may be treated as having been done. Accordingly, the court’s revisionary powers should not be exercised in a manner that “paves the way for a flood of re-litigation every time the criminal law gets changed” (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Kim Han </span>at [23]). Changes in the law <span class="font-italic">after </span>the conclusion of a criminal matter, and especially after the conclusion of a criminal appeal, do not warrant overriding the finality of adjudication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Nevertheless, we recognise that there will be exceptional circumstances where a subsequent change in the law extends to an offender a colourable claim of innocence or calls for us to revisit the soundness of an offender’s sentence. We consider that the threshold of substantial injustice, while high, nonetheless allows for the vindication of the rights of the minority of litigants who have been grievously wronged, and that this threshold is where the delicate balance between truth and finality properly lies.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sundaresh Menon <br/>Chief Justice</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Judith Prakash<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Yong Kiat Francis SC and Wong Woon Kwong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cheong Aik Chye (A C Cheong &amp; Co) for the respondent in CA/CM 11/2020;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">A Revi Shanker s/o K Annamalai (ARShanker Law Chambers) for the respondent in CA/CM 12/2020;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The respondent in CA/CM 13/2020 in person;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gill Amarick Singh (Amarick Gill LLC) for the respondent in CA/CM 14/2020.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

In <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>, the court held that where a single compressed block of cannabis-related plant material had been certified to contain (a) cannabis and (b) fragmented vegetable matter containing cannabinol (“CBN”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), it was impermissible for the Prosecution to prefer both (a) a charge in respect of the portion certified to consist purely of cannabis, and (b) a charge in respect of the portion consisting of fragmented vegetable matter that had been found to contain CBN and THC (hereafter referred to as the “dual charging practice”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The respondents in these applications had been charged with and convicted pursuant to the Prosecution’s “dual charging practice”. Following the decision in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Prosecution filed these applications inviting the Court of Appeal to review its previous decisions in relation to the respondents. However, the Prosecution subsequently sought leave to withdraw the applications on the basis that the respondents’ cases had been properly decided in accordance with the prevailing law at the time.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Although the Court of Appeal granted the Prosecution leave to withdraw the applications, it went on to consider the applicable threshold for reopening a concluded decision in the light of a subsequent change in the law.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court of Appeal’s grounds of decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The finality of court decisions</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The starting point was that court judgments, and particularly decisions in concluded criminal appeals, were final and could not be reopened on their merits (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[7]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[8]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[33]</span>). It followed from the principle of finality that a matter ordinarily could not be reopened just because there had been a change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[13]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 However, the default position of finality could be departed from in appropriate cases by invoking: (a) the Court of Appeal’s inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal; or (b) an appellate court’s statutory power to review its earlier decision under s 394I of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[13]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court’s inherent and statutory powers of review</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 As held in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>”), the Court of Appeal would only exercise its inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal if there was sufficient material on which it could conclude that there had been a miscarriage of justice (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[21]</span>). Material would only be considered “sufficient” if it was “new” <span class="font-italic">and</span> “compelling” (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[21]</span>). “New” material could take the form of new legal arguments made following a change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[21]</span>). “Compelling” material referred to material that was “reliable, substantial and powerfully probative” and that could show “almost conclusively” that there had been a “miscarriage of justice” (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[22]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Under s 394I of the CPC, an appellate court had the power to review its earlier decision (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>). A subsequent change in the law could constitute the basis for a review application under s 394I of the CPC (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[32]</span>).<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Since s 394J of the CPC codified the requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, an applicant’s choice between the court’s statutory and inherent powers of review did not typically affect the substance of a review application (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[27]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The conditions under which an appellate court could reopen an earlier decision in the light of a subsequent change in the law</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 There was a dearth of local authorities on the conditions under which an appellate court might reopen the merits of an earlier decision following a change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span>). The Court of Appeal thus drew guidance from the English authorities on the analogous issue of granting leave to appeal out of time following a change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Having considered the English authorities, the Court of Appeal held that an appellate court could only reopen an earlier decision (or grant leave to appeal out of time) when it had been presented with new material that gave rise to a <span class="font-italic">powerful probability</span> that <span class="font-italic">substantial injustice</span> had arisen (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[70]</span>). In this context, the new material would likely be new legal arguments based on changes in the law that occurred after the appellate court had rendered its decision (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[70]</span>). The high threshold of substantial injustice would not easily be met and would certainly not be satisfied simply because the law had changed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[6]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[73]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[11</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 An <span class="font-italic">injustice</span> could be said to have arisen in one of two ways. Where an applicant sought to set aside his <span class="font-italic">conviction</span>, an injustice would only have arisen if the new material struck at the <span class="font-italic">soundness</span> of the <span class="font-italic">conviction</span> in a <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> way (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71(a)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">i)]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[74]</span>). In other words, the new material had to give rise to a powerful probability that <span class="font-italic">no </span>offence had been committed at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>). Such new material would typically arise in the light of subsequent changes in the law as to the constituent elements of an offence and/or the proper interpretation of statutory provisions<span class="font-italic"> </span>that generated criminal liability (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>). Matters of procedural fairness (or criminal procedure) did not typically go towards the soundness of a conviction (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[78]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Where an applicant sought to challenge his <span class="font-italic">sentence</span>, an injustice would only have arisen if the new material showed that the earlier decision was based on a <span class="font-italic">fundamental misapprehension of the law</span> (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71(a)(ii)] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[79]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Not only must an <span class="font-italic">injustice</span> have arisen, but the injustice also had to be <span class="font-italic">substantial</span> (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>). An applicant would have established substantial injustice if he showed that there was a <span class="font-italic">powerful probability</span> that his <span class="font-italic">conviction</span> was <span class="font-italic">unsound</span> and if the facts did not disclose any other offence of comparable gravity (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71(b)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">i)] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>). Conversely, even where an applicant showed that his conviction was unsustainable, he would have failed to establish <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>injustice if he could have been charged with or convicted of other offences of comparable gravity despite the change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[65(d)] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Where the impugned decision was one on sentence, any injustice (arising from a fundamental misapprehension of the law) would only be considered substantial if the said misapprehension had a <span class="font-italic">significant </span>bearing on the sentence imposed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[71(b)(ii)</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Applicants seeking to rely on a change in the law ought to file their review applications with all due urgency (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>). The longer the delay between the change in the law and the filing of the review application, the more it could presumptively be said that the applicant had deliberately chosen not to challenge the earlier decision against him, and the more difficult it would likely be for him to prove that he had suffered substantial injustice (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>). The court would consider the length of time that had elapsed and the reasons advanced to explain any delay (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The Court of Appeal’s approach was aligned with s 394J of the CPC and its decision in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and was consonant with the cases in which an appellate court had revisited an earlier decision following a change in the law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[72]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[73]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[10</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span>). The Court of Appeal further observed that would be exceedingly rare for applicants to establish substantial injustice based on the change in the law occasioned by <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The avenues by which the court could revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 There were three ways for the court to revisit an earlier decision following a change in the law. First, where a decision had not been appealed against previously, an appellate court could grant an offender leave to appeal out of time (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>). Second, where an appeal against a lower court’s decision had already been disposed of, the appellate court could either exercise its inherent power to review the concluded appeal or grant the offender leave to make a review application (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>). Third, the Court of Appeal could exercise its power to review any matter on its own motion, although this exceptional power had not hitherto been exercised (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[103]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[10</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The present applications</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 No substantial injustice had arisen in respect of the respondents in CA/CM 12/2020 (“CM 12”) and CA/CM 13/2020 (“CM 13”) (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">29]</span>). Setting aside the cannabis mixture charge would have made no difference to the sentence imposed on the respondent in CM 12 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>). Further, the sentence imposed on the respondent in CM 13 was very much on the lenient side to begin with (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">29]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The respondents in CA/CM 11/2020 (“CM 11”) and CA/CM 14/2020 (“CM 14”) could not be allowed to take advantage of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> without having to consider how the Prosecution might have acted had it appreciated the legal position in <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> earlier (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[11</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>). Given that the Prosecution might well have exercised its prosecutorial discretion differently by proceeding on capital charges, or in the case of the respondent in CM 11, on a different combination of charges such as would yield <span class="font-italic">at least </span>the same aggregate sentence that was imposed, no substantial injustice had arisen in relation to the respondents in CM 11 and CM 14 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[11</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The Court of Appeal noted that <span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> was a departure from its previous decision in which it had held that the “dual charging practice” was permissible (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]</span>). The principle of finality militated against the reopening of cases that were concluded in accordance with the pre-<span class="font-italic">Saravanan</span> legal position, which was good law for nearly 24 years (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
