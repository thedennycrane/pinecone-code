</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Second, in relation to [18(c)–(e)] above, WS was not able to point to any part of the financial documents provided by HT to suggest that HT had cashflow problems, previous problems with its trade receivables, or that there was specific cause for concern over the recoverability of HT’s trade receivables. As mentioned above, I reviewed the unredacted project documents provided by HT and was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of records of work awarded and payments due to HT. That the projects involved work such as installation of aluminium screens rather whole construction projects was simply a reflection of the nature of HT’s business. The fact that HT was engaged for only parts of construction projects, rather than the project as a whole, did not mean that WS could not recover money from HT. It was also noteworthy that WS was also a sub-contractor for various projects, rather than being the main contractor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 WS had also not satisfactorily explained how the factors set out in [18(f)–(g)] above were indicative of a risk of non-recovery. Depending on the nature of the business and its business model, operating on a “slim” workforce could be said to show prudence and better prospects of viability. The same could be said of the fact that HT rented its office. The size of a workforce and/or whether office premises are rented do not, in themselves, speak towards the likelihood of non-recovery. They are at best neutral factors. Moreover, HT had adduced evidence to show that their employees were paid regularly. This thus showed that, although its workforce was “slim,” HT was able to sustain its workforce and operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Finally, WS alleged that HT could easily close its business if the dispute was resolved in WS’s favour. It should be borne in mind that closure of business brings along other repercussions for the directors and the staff. It is the likelihood of HT closing its business, rather than the ease, that is the pertinent question. In the present case, WS had not adduced any evidence that indicated a likelihood that HT would be unable to pay WS and would choose instead to close its business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Further, I agreed with the observations of the AR that, unlike the situations in <span class="font-italic">CEQ</span> and <span class="font-italic">Dongah</span><span class="font-italic"> Geological Engineering Co Ltd v Jungwoo EC Pte Ltd</span> [2021] SGHC 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Dongah</span>”), no evidence had been produced here pointing to any possible dissipation of assets or potential liquidation of the company, multiple changes of directors/shareholders, suggestion of bankruptcy of any of the officers with a connection to HT, or of key company officers leaving Singapore with no intention to return. There was therefore nothing to suggest that HT intended to cease operations, leaving WS with a paper judgment, if the dispute was ultimately resolved in its favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Moreover, it was held in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>at [70] that, in considering whether to stay the enforcement of an adjudication determination, a court may “properly consider whether the claimant’s financial distress was, to a significant degree, caused by the respondent’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount and, also, whether the claimant was already in a similar state of financial strength or weakness (as the case may be) at the time the parties entered into their contract.” In this case, the adjudicated amount withheld by WS from HT amounted to around $643,923.38, based on HT’s submissions. As evidenced by the financial documents it had produced, HT was not presently in financial distress. While there was nothing that showed whether HT’s financial position had weakened compared to when the parties entered into their contract, any weakening of HT’s financial position could certainly be attributed, at least in part, to WS’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Based on the evidence adduced, nothing suggested that WS would be unable to recover the moneys paid to HT pursuant to the AD if the stay were not granted and the dispute was resolved in WS’s favour. I therefore found that a stay should not be granted on this ground. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether enforcement would push WS into liquidation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, WS sought a stay on the ground that enforcement of the AD would push it into liquidation, given its weak financial position. It submitted that payment pursuant to the AD would defeat the purpose of the SOPA regime, which the court in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> described at [20] as “pay now, argue later.” WS submitted that if payment now rendered WS insolvent, it would not be able to “argue later.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Firstly, there was no legal basis for WS’s submission. In my view, WS’s submission completely misinterpreted <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> and attempted to use it for a proposition which <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> did not put forth. The phrase cited by WS related to the need for an expeditious regime under SOPA. As the court in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> explained at [20]: “… payments, and therefore cash flow, should not be held up by counterclaims and claims for set-offs that may prove to be specious at the end of lengthy and expensive proceedings that have to be undertaken in order to disentangle the knot of disputed claims and cross-claims.” In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>”), the CA explained at [1] that the aim of SOPA was to establish “a fast and low cost adjudication system to resolve payment disputes” (quoting the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(16 November 2004), vol 78 at col 1113 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minister of State for National Development)), in the light of “the need to ensure that contractors and subcontractors in the construction industry receive timely payments for work done and materials supplied.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> did not establish that, where a party is on the verge of insolvency, there should be a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination. The only two grounds for such a stay were laid out in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>, as set out at [2] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Indeed, as rightly highlighted by HT, if WS did have genuine financial difficulties, that would equally point to a need to ensure that HT recovered the adjudicated amount without further delay.

However, that same cashflow statement evidenced payments by WS of $20,000 to its director, $329,681 to its suppliers, and $209,579 in salaries. It was not evident from this cashflow statement that WS could not adjust such payments and avoid liquidation, if it made payment to HT for the sums due on the AD. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) WS also referred to a document to show that it is nearing its $1m limit of an overdraft facility.

</div> However, this, in itself, did not show that WS was nearing the limits of its financing facilities or that it had no other available sources of financing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 When it was pointed out that those documents did not show whether WS would be unable to “argue later” or if WS had other sources of financing, counsel for WS replied that he had nothing to add on in terms of factual evidence of insolvency. It was also noteworthy that WS’s reliance on its cash inflow and outflow to establish that payment pursuant to the AD would render it insolvent is contrary to WS’s submission that the cash flow test should apply to determine insolvency for HT. Critically, WS had not provided any evidence on its current assets or liabilities, or its recent financial position, to show that it could not pay its debts as and when they fell due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Furthermore, WS had cited, in support of its case, <span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction Pte Ltd v JH Projects Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1192 (“<span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19], which stated that, in winding up applications, businesses “that have a chance of recovery should not be pushed into a state that makes it difficult for them to recover” (quoting <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 at [82]). In light of this quote in <span class="font-italic">Strategic Construction</span>, it was not clear on present evidence that WS would be put into liquidation, even if there was a winding up application, as there would also be a consideration of whether WS has “a chance of recovery.” </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 For the reasons set out above, in a similar vein to the court’s finding in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>at [72], I found that “it [was] evident that [WS] had not met the high threshold that was required to justify granting a stay of enforcement of the Adjudication Determination.” The submissions of WS were without merit and unsupported by the evidence. Granting WS a stay would defeat the purpose of SOPA, which, as explained in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>, is to ensure that, in light of the need for timely payment in the construction industry, there is a fast and low-cost system to resolve payment disputes. I hence dismissed the appeal. Finally, I awarded costs to HT in the amount of $8,000 all-in.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ashok Kumar Rai and Yeo Wei Ying Jolyn (Cairnhill Law LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Tay and Lee Yun Long (Chan Neo LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
