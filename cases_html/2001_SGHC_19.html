<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Addendum Grounds of

Judgment on Costs, Leave to Appeal and Stay of Execution</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. In his statement of claim, the plaintiff, Mr Denis Mathew Harte (Mr Harte),

alleged that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Dr Tan Hun Hoe (Dr Tan), was negligent and had

acted in breach of his duty of care and contractual duties to Mr Harte, when he treated and operated

on him for his fertility problem. Gleneagles Hospital Limited (the hospital) was joined as the

2<sup>nd</sup> defendants on the basis that Dr Tan was their servant or agent. At the conclusion of

a lengthy trial, I decided that Dr Tan was not negligent during Mr Hartes pre-operative

consultation. Neither was he negligent when he performed the bilateral varicocelectomy operation on

Mr Harte. However, I found that Dr Tan was negligent in his post-operative care and treatment.

Accordingly, I assessed the quantum of damages at about S$96,600. Mr Hartes claim against the

hospital was dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">2. I then invited the parties to submit on the question of costs. Counsel for Mr

Harte argued that Dr Tan should pay not only Mr Hartes costs but also the costs of the hospital.

I was urged to impose either a <i>Bullock</i> or <i>Sanderson</i> cost order. Counsel for both

defendants opposed this. Counsel for Dr Tan also disclosed that the quantum of damages recovered was

less than the two offers to settle made earlier by Dr Tan, initially at S$150,000, and later doubled

to S$300,000. Since Mr Harte did not accept the last offer of $300,000, and eventually recovered an

amount substantially less, he should pay Dr Tan his costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the

2<sup>nd</sup> offer to settle. It was further submitted that Dr Tan succeeded on the substantial

issues at the trial that he was not negligent in his pre-operation treatment and surgery, and that

Mr Hartes fall from the toilet seat whilst in an unconscious state was the cause of his

testicular injury. Hence, a significant part of Mr Hartes costs should be disallowed in any case

as those issues, on which Mr Harte failed, had consumed the major part of the trial time. In reply,

counsel for Mr Harte contended that both offers to settle were invalid as they did not comply with

the requisite Rules of Court (Rules).</p>
<p align="justify">3. After hearing the parties, I decided that the offers to settle were not made

in compliance with the Rules. As such, the severe consequences provided under the Rules requiring Mr

Harte, who lost the gamble so to speak, to indemnify Dr Tan for his further costs from the date of

service of the offer could not be imposed. Given the factual circumstances in particular the

extraordinary scrotal swelling following Dr Tans surgery and the disastrous results thereafter on

the one hand, and on the other, the lack of pain in his scrotum and any obvious signs of scrotal

bruising immediately after the fall, I did not think that Mr Harte had put forward an unreasonable

or clearly untenable claim that Dr Tan had been negligent in his pre-operative treatment and

surgery, and that he had caused Mr Harte to suffer from bilateral testicular atrophy. I was thus not

prepared to disallow any part of the usual costs that a successful plaintiff in an action would

generally be entitled to, although Mr Harte had failed to make good a substantial part of his claim

which was in relation to Dr Tans operation.</p>
<p align="justify">4. After considering all the relevant factors including the offer from the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant to settle the action, I made the following orders in exercise of my discretion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I Dr Tan was to pay Mr Hartes costs, to be taxed if not agreed;</p>
<p align="justify">II Mr Harte was to pay the hospitals costs, to be taxed if not agreed;</p>
<p align="justify">III In view of the complexity of the trial, involving a considerable number of

  complicated and difficult medical, technical and factual issues particularly in the area of

  causation, I granted a cost certificate for 2 counsel for all three parties. As I did not think

  that the amount of damages claimed had been deliberately inflated just so that the matter could be

  tried in the High Court, I did not order the costs to be assessed on the Subordinate Court scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5. I shall now explain the legal basis of my decision.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Bullock and Sanderson orders</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">6. Paragraph 62/B/124 at p 1222 of the White Book 1999 Edn Vol 1 sets out

succinctly the nature of the <i>Bullock</i> and <i>Sanderson</i> orders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Where a plaintiff sues two defendants, making his claim against them in the

  alternative, and succeeds only against one of them, the Court in its discretion may order the

  unsuccessful defendant to pay the successful defendants costs. This may be done either by an

  order that the unsuccessful defendant pay the successful defendants costs direct to him (known

  as a "Sanderson Order" from <i>Sanderson v. Blyth Theatre Co.</i> [1903] 2 K.B. 533, CA)

  or by an order that the plaintiff pay the successful defendants costs to him and recover them

  from the unsuccessful defendant as part of the plaintiffs costs of the action (known as a

  "Bullock Order" from <i>Bullock v. London General Omnibus Co.</i> [1907] 1 K.B. 264,

  CA).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7. In my view, such orders are not limited to the cases where the plaintiffs

claim against the defendants is only in the alternative. Where there is no good reason to deprive

the successful defendant of his costs, then the principal consideration is whether in all the

circumstances of the particular case, it would be fair and reasonable for the unsuccessful defendant

(and not the plaintiff) to bear the costs of the successful defendant directly or indirectly. The

usual order however is for the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant eventually found not

liable to him, since he must <i>prima facie</i> be held responsible for his wrong decision to join

the successful defendant in the first place. He has to bear the consequence of his own choice of

defendants in litigation.</p>
<p align="justify">8. In <i>Mulready v Bell Ltd </i>[1953] 2 All ER 215, Lord Goddard stated that a <i>Bullock

</i>(or <i>Sanderson</i>)<i> </i>order would not be appropriate where the plaintiff alleges

independent causes of action against different defendants, and the respective breaches of duty are

in no way connected.</p>
<p align="justify">9. In <i>Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and another appeal </i><nobr>[1996] 2 SLR 505</nobr>, Yong Pung How CJ stated at p 521E that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If the plaintiff includes an additional defendant because of his uncertainty of

  the law rather than the facts, the court will not make either a <i>Bullock </i>or <i>Sanderson </i>order

  (<i>Poulton v Moore </i><nobr>[1913] WN 349</nobr>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">10. The following paragraph in <i>Poulton v Moore </i>by Lush J at 350 was also

quoted by the Chief Justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The reason for the order in <i>Bullock v London General Omnibus Co </i>was that

  as the omnibus company had wrongly thrown the responsibility for the accident to the plaintiff on

  to the other defendants, they had caused the plaintiff to be in a state of uncertainty on the

  facts as to who was really liable, and therefore they were responsible for the extra costs he

  incurred in suing both defendants There is no precedent for such an order being made where the

  joinder of an additional defendant has resulted from the plaintiff being doubtful as to the law,

  nor is there any principle that I can see upon which such an order can be justified. It was the

  fault or misfortune of the plaintiff if he was not satisfied as to his legal rights; it certainly

  was not the fault of [the defendants].</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">11. Thus, in determining whether to grant a <i>Bullock</i> or <i>Sanderson</i>

order, the following factors are relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) What facts are reasonably ascertainable by the plaintiff before the

  decision is made to join the successful defendant (D1);</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Whether the facts themselves are unclear to such an extent that it is

  necessary to safeguard the plaintiffs position by bringing in D1. Where it is reasonable for

  the plaintiff to adopt the position that either one or the other or both defendants may be liable

  and hence prudence dictates that both should be joined, then a <i>Bullock</i> or <i>Sanderson</i>

  order may be appropriate;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Of considerable importance is whether the unsuccessful defendant (D2)

  has tried to shift all or some of his liability to D1 or has characterised the facts such that D1

  is more blameworthy and should bear a greater proportion of the damages, in which case it may be

  appropriate to make D2 (and not the plaintiff) shoulder D1s costs because D2 has put the

  plaintiff in a difficult position, thereby forcing him to join D1.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Whether the plaintiffs claim against D1 and D2 is in reality separate

  and distinct, in which case it will be inappropriate for D2 to pay D1s costs (See <i>Donovan v.

  Walters</i> (1926) 135 L.T. 12). Being independent claims, it is unlikely for D1 to have

  influenced the joinder of D2. Hence, the plaintiff must answer for the costs of D1 himself.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) The likelihood of the plaintiff or D2 becoming insolvent may dictate

  whether a <i>Bullock</i> or <i>Sanderson</i> order should be made. The court has to determine

  whether it is more equitable to put the risk of non-recovery of D1s costs from D2 on the

  shoulders of the plaintiff or on D1 himself. Thus the conduct of the plaintiff <i>vis--vis</i>

  the successful defendant has to be considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12. I agreed with counsel for Dr Tan that <i>Mohd bin Sapri </i>should be

applicable on the facts of the case here. Mr Hartes decision to join the hospital had been

questionable. The hospital had, from the very beginning in its correspondence prior to the

commencement of proceedings, rightly disabused Mr Harte of any wrong impression that Dr Tan might

have been their employee, servant or agent. Neither was there any representation to that effect by

the hospital or by Dr Tan. Mr Harte first sought out Dr Tan in his private clinic for his fertility

treatment. Following those consultations, Mr Harte agreed to have Dr Tan perform a bilateral

varicocelectomy on him at the hospital. It was at the instructions of Dr Tan that Mr Harte admitted

himself into the hospital, which merely accredited Dr Tan, an independent contractor, with the use

of the hospital facilities and with admitting privileges for his private patients, of which Mr Harte

was one of them.</p>
<p align="justify">13. The facts and the law were both reasonably clear. By simply providing the

operating theatre, ward and nursing facilities to its accredited surgeons, the hospital could not

become the principal for the operation, over which the hospital had absolutely no control. The

independent surgeon continued to take full charge of the operation and he remained the principal for

the operation. Under these circumstances, the hospital could not be held jointly liable for any

negligent acts of the independent, private surgeon, who happened to be given the privilege of using

those facilities in the hospital for his operations on his private patients. It was also not

disputed that none of the hospitals nurses were negligent when they took care of Mr Harte in the

ward after the operation. He had gone to the toilet against their advice soon after he had woken up

from the surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">14. Mr Harte was plainly at fault in joining the hospital as an additional

defendant. His case against the hospital was at the outset quite unsustainable. Even if the law were

not clear, he would still have to bear the adverse consequences for his own mistake in suing the

hospital. Throughout, Dr Tan made no attempt to shift any aspect of the alleged liability against

him to the hospital nor had he tried to muddy any facts with the intention of shifting the blame to

the hospital, thus forcing Mr Harte to join the hospital as a defendant. I thus refused to make

either a <i>Bullock </i>or a <i>Sanderson </i>order. Accordingly, costs should follow the event in

respect of the plaintiffs claim against the hospital.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Clarification of cost order</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">15. I would take this opportunity to clarify my cost order. It is unfortunate

that I did not make clear that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is to pay the costs of the plaintiff, <i>but

only in relation to the plaintiffs claim against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, </i>which was what

I had in mind all along. This means that the plaintiffs costs in relation to issues on agency and

vicarious liability, which were exclusive to the plaintiffs claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants, would be borne by the plaintiff himself because I dismissed the plaintiffs quite

distinct claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants and had ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs

of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. In my view, it would be totally inappropriate that the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant be made to bear the getting up costs plus the portion of the plaintiffs costs at the

trial in relation to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants case, particularly when the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants had written to the plaintiffs solicitors prior to the commencement of the proceedings

stating in very clear terms that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was not their servant or agent, and

hence, could not be vicariously liable for any negligence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Offer to settle</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">16. Counsel for Dr Tan contended that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants offer to

settle was valid, and since the plaintiff recovered an amount less than the offer, the plaintiff

must suffer the adverse cost consequences provided for in Order 22A Rule 9 of the Rules. Order 22A

is obviously intended to encourage the settlement of claims.</p>
<p align="justify">17. On 11 May 2000, Dr Tan offered to settle the plaintiffs claim for

S$150,000. Five days later, on 16 May 2000, an increased offer of S$300,000 was served on the

plaintiffs solicitors because Dr Tan was very anxious that his name should not appear in the

papers at all, and he agreed to double the amount offered, which counsel considered to be very

reasonable and extremely generous. Counsel then submitted that the plaintiff should only be entitled

to costs on a standard basis up to the date of service of the revised offer and the plaintiff should

pay his costs on an indemnity basis from the date of service of the offer till the conclusion of the

trial. For convenience, I have set out below the terms of the increased offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant offers to settle these proceedings on the

  following terms:-</p>
<p align="justify">1. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant offers to pay the Plaintiff the sum of

  S$300,000.00; and</p>
<p align="justify">2. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant offers to pay the Plaintiff his Party and Party

  Costs together with disbursements reasonably incurred up to the date of receipt of this Offer To

  Settle, to be agreed or taxed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">18. The question before the court was whether this offer was a conforming offer,

thus attracting the application of Order 22A Rule 9(3), which stipulates that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Where an offer to settle made by a defendant </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in

    respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not

    more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer

  was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, <b><u>unless

  the Court orders otherwise</u></b>. (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19. Of some significance is the fact that even under Rule 9(3), the court retains

the discretion not to impose the adverse cost consequences in an appropriate case where there are

special reasons for doing so. Order 22A Rule 9(5), a recent amendment taking effect from 15 December

1999, makes it very clear that notwithstanding anything in the offer to settle, the courts wide

discretion in this regard is still preserved. Recognising the severity of these cost consequences,

the Rules themselves thus ensure that the court has the full discretion to ameliorate what could

otherwise be an unduly harsh consequence if Rule 9(3) is applied strictly across the board

regardless of the circumstances. This assumes even greater importance nowadays with the cost of

litigation running possibly into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, sometimes even several times

higher than the judgment sum awarded as in this case.</p>
<p align="justify">20. Counsel for Mr Harte argued that Order 22A Rule 9(3) ought not to apply, as

the offer to settle did not comply with Rule 10. Order 22A Rule 10 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Where there are 2 or more defendants, the plaintiff may offer to settle with

  any defendant and any defendant may offer to settle with the plaintiff, but where the defendants

  are <b><i><u>alleged</u></i><u> to be</u></b> <b><u>jointly or jointly and severally liable</u></b>

  to the plaintiff in respect of a claim and rights of contribution or indemnity <b><u>may</u></b>

  exist between the defendants, <b><u>the cost consequences</u></b> <b><u>prescribed by Rule 9 <i>do

  not apply</i> to an offer to settle</u></b> <b><u>unless</u></b> </p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">(b) in the case of an offer made to the plaintiff </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the offer is an offer <b><u>to settle</u></b> the plaintiffs claim <b><u>against

    all the defendants</u></b> <b>and <u>to pay the costs of any defendant who does not join in

    making the offer</u></b>; or</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the offer is made by all the defendants and is an offer to settle the

    claim against all the defendants, and, by the terms of the offer, they are made jointly and

    severally liable to the plaintiff for the whole of the offer. (Emphasis is mine.)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21. The rationale behind Rule 10 (b) is to ensure that a defendant alleged to be

jointly or jointly and severally liable with any other defendant does not offer to settle only his

part. This is to avoid putting the plaintiff in an embarrassing position having to deal with the

balance of his claim against the other defendants jointly or jointly and severally liable, and

having at the same time to face the risk of a cost penalty should he decide not to accept the offer

coming from only one of the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">22. Halsburys Laws of Singapore on Tort Volume 18, Year 2000 sets out the

following as joint tortfeasors:</p>
<blockquote>

  a.    employer and employee where the employer is vicariously liable for the tort

  of the employee;

  <p align="justify">b.    principal and agent where the principal is liable for the

  tort of the agent;

  </p><p align="justify">c.    employer and independent contractor where the employer is

  liable for the tort of his independent contractor;

  </p><p align="justify">d.    a person who instigates another to commit a tort and the

  person who then commits the tort;

  </p><p align="justify">e.    persons who take concerted action to a common end and in

  the course of executing that joint purpose commit a tort.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">23. Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts 16<sup>th</sup> Edn at p 148 similarly

categorised as joint tortfeasors, the agent who commits a tort on behalf of his principal, the

employee who commits a tort in the course of his employment including the independent contractor who

commits a tort in a case where his employer is liable for the acts of the independent contractor.</p>
<p align="justify">24. Mr Harte in his statement of claim had <b><u>alleged</u></b> that Dr Tan was

the servant or agent of the hospital and hence, the hospital was vicariously and therefore <b><u>jointly

liable</u></b> for the negligence of Dr Tan. Dr Tan had not offered to settle the whole of the

plaintiffs claim against <b><u>all the defendants</u></b> and neither did he offer to pay

the costs of the hospital, which had refused to join in the settlement. I have no doubt that the

plaintiff had in substance <b><u>alleged</u></b> that both defendants were jointly liable. Yet Dr

Tans offer, as it appeared to me, was essentially to settle only the plaintiffs part of the

claim against him, although it was worded to settle these proceedings. The terms of the offer

were not particularly clear.</p>
<p align="justify">25. On a plain reading of Order 22A Rule 10, it would seem that a subsequent

finding by the court that there was no joint liability does not affect the applicability of Rule 10,

which is simply based on the claim as alleged. That an allegation has been unsubstantiated or proved

wrong does not mean that it is not an allegation to begin with or that the allegation is a

completely wild allegation. For reasons of certainty, a defendant must be able to ascertain from the

statement of claim what has been alleged against him. Then and only then can he decide how he is to

construct the terms of his offer to settle. On receipt of the offer, the plaintiff must be able to

determine if that offer has been made in compliance with the Rules. Thereafter the plaintiff must

consider whether to accept it, ignore it or make a counter-offer. The scheme in Rule 10 will hardly

be workable if it has to depend on a finding of fact by the court at the conclusion of the trial

whether or not the defendants were on the evidence jointly or jointly and severally liable because

the point of decision making both by the offeror and offeree with regards to the offer in question

is not after receipt of the courts judgment at the end of the trial but before that.</p>
<p align="justify">26. Hence Rule 10 is founded upon whether the defendants have been <b><i><u>alleged</u></i></b>

to be jointly or jointly and severally liable, and not whether they have been proved to be jointly,

or jointly and severally liable. Of course, if the plaintiff has no reasonable basis at all to mount

a cause of action based on agency and vicarious liability, I would have expected the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants to apply to strike out the plaintiffs claim against them under Order 18 Rule 19. The

fact that no such application was even made indicates that the matter was not exactly as

straightforward, and thus, there was a reasonable belief on the part of the plaintiff to found a

claim based on vicarious liability and agency against the hospital, having regard to what he

perceived to be a very close connection between the hospital and Dr Tan.</p>
<p align="justify">27. As such, I was satisfied that the alleged joint liability was not some

fanciful allegation that was obviously unsupportable from the beginning and hence, could not in law

and in substance amount to a proper allegation for the purpose of Rule 10. The fact that the

plaintiff was proved wrong on this issue is quite another matter.</p>
<p align="justify">28. Since Dr Tan did not offer to settle Mr Hartes claim both against himself

and the hospital and neither had he offered to pay the costs of the hospital, Rule 10 b(i) was

plainly not satisfied. Neither was b(ii) since the hospital refused to join in making any offer to

settle Mr Hartes claim against them. Hence, the punitive cost consequences spelt out in Rule 9

could not visit the plaintiff although the plaintiff had rejected Dr Tans generous offer of

$300,000, which far exceeded the damages I had assessed at the conclusion of the trial. Rule 10 <b>expressly

provides</b> that the cost consequences prescribed by Rule 9 are not to apply to any offer to settle

unless the conditions stipulated in b(i) or b(ii) are satisfied. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not

running the risk of any adverse cost consequences prescribed under Rule 9 when he ignored the offer

because there was no offer to settle falling within b(i) or b(ii) which he could properly consider.

By extension, the court should similarly be very slow to impose the adverse cost consequences (of a

nature similar to Rule 9) under a separate exercise of discretion in the case of the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants offer to settle, which was not in an acceptable form as prescribed by the Rules

because the plaintiff would legitimately be labouring under an expectation that those cost

consequences in Rule 9 would not apply as stated by the Rules themselves when he chose to reject the

non-conforming offer.</p>
<p align="justify">29. However counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant argued on two grounds why

Order 22A, Rule 10 would not apply: (a) where the allegation of joint or joint and several liability

was not a responsible allegation with some basis, and (b) where there was no question of

contribution between the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">30. I will deal with the 2<sup>nd</sup> ground first. Rule 10 does not state that

the rights of contribution or indemnity <b><u>must</u></b> exist between the defendants as a further

condition before Rule 10 can apply. It simply states that rights of contribution or indemnity <b><u>may</u></b>

exist between the defendants (second limb of Rule 10). As such, where on the alleged facts

in the statement of claim, there are reasonable grounds for the plaintiff to believe that such

rights of contribution or indemnity may or can exist between some of the co-defendants, Rule 10 is

applicable, whether or not, it is subsequently proved at trial that those rights never existed at

all. I am reinforced in my view by Order 22A Rule 11, which provides that where two or more

defendants are <b><i><u>alleged</u></i></b> to be jointly or jointly and severally liable to the

plaintiff in respect of a claim, any defendant may make to any other defendant an offer to

contribute in Form 38D towards a settlement of the claim.</p>
<p align="justify">31. On the alleged facts of this case, it was not conclusive that there could

never be any rights of indemnity or contribution between the hospital and Dr Tan. They were not

necessarily within the plaintiffs domain of knowledge. In my opinion, the second limb of Rule 10

was satisfied and hence, this argument of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant failed.</p>
<p align="justify">32. On the 1<sup>st</sup> ground, I understood counsel to be submitting that

there was no reason why the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants would want to participate in any offer to

settle in the first place. As the claim against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants was absolutely without

legal basis, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants would obviously insist on their full legal costs should

the plaintiff withdraw his entire claim against both defendants upon acceptance of the settlement

offer from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Hence, there was no logical reason why the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant should additionally offer to pay the costs of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants incurred as a

result of an irresponsible claim initiated by the plaintiff himself before the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant could make a good offer to settle these proceedings (as would be required by Rule 10

b (i)). Apparently, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was expecting the plaintiff to accept that he had

wrongly sued the hospital and therefore, he ought to pay the costs of the hospital himself should he

accept the offer. There is much force in counsels argument that the law does not expect the

impossible from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Why should the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant offer to pay

the costs of the hospital for no good legal reason other than to fulfil the requirements of Rule 10

b(i) just to benefit from the cost advantages available under Rule 9, when the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant already held the firm view that the hospital was wrongly joined and that view was proved

right in the end? As it turned out, the 1st defendant only made a partial offer, so to speak, to

settle the matter only as between himself and the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">33. I concluded that the terms of the partial offer did not accord with the

strict requirements of Rule 10 (b). Since the Rules stipulate that the usual adverse cost

consequences prescribed by Rule 9 are not to apply unless either Rule 10 b(i) or b(ii) is satisfied,

it follows then that those serious cost consequences flowing from Rule 9 cannot be imposed as a

matter of course under Order 22A. An offer that clearly does not conform to the scheme under Rule 9

read with Rule 10 cannot simply be treated as a conforming offer, or equated to one in terms of its

consequences.</p>
<p align="justify">34. In my view, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would have to invoke the discretion

of the court (and not Rule 9) to impose the adverse cost consequences having regard to the

particular circumstances of his case. So far as Rule 10 is concerned, its ambit is sufficiently

plain and unambiguous.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Exercise of discretion</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">35. Although the normal order is for costs to follow the event, the court still

retains a wide discretion to take account of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants generous albeit

non-conforming offer to settle and grant appropriate cost advantages to him. It remains open to me

to decide on costs in the usual way as provided by the Rules and give whatever weight to the

non-conforming offer to settle as I think appropriate.</p>
<p align="justify">36. Order 59 Rule 2(2) states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Subject to the express provisions of any written law and of these Rules, the

  costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Courtshall be in the discretion of the

  Court, and the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent the costs are

  to be paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">37. How then is the discretion on award of costs to be exercised? The normal rule

is that the court shall order the costs to follow the event except when the circumstances of the

case require the court, in exercise of its discretion, to make some other cost order: Order 59 Rule

3(2).</p>
<p align="justify">38. Although the court has an unfettered discretion to make whatever cost order

the justice of the case demands, this discretion obviously cannot be exercised arbitrarily, or on

extraneous grounds and irrelevant considerations. It must be exercised judicially guided by

established rules and principles.</p>
<p align="justify">39. Special matters to be taken into account when exercising discretion are:</p>
<blockquote>

  (1)    Payment of money into court and the amount of such payment: Order 59 Rule 5.

  The defendant paying money into court exceeding the sum awarded is generally regarded as the

  successful party in the litigation. Therefore he is entitled to be paid costs as from the date of

  payment in and he can only be deprived of such costs by the proper exercise of judicial discretion

  upon proper materials arising out of the instant litigation or the conduct of it: <i>Finlay v

  Railway Executive</i> [1950] 2 All E.R. 969; White Book 1999 Edn Vol 1 para 22/5/7 at p 421.

  Interestingly, there is nothing within Order 22 pertaining to Payment into and out of court

  that specifically deals with the consequences of not obtaining a judgment better than the amount

  paid into court. Nothing similar to Order 22A Rule 9 exists in Order 22. The only provision

  governing this is Order 59 Rule 5 which simply requires that the court, when exercising its

  discretion as to costs, shall, to such extent as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take

  into account any payment into court and the amount of such payment.

  <p align="justify">(2)    Acts done or omissions made unreasonably or improperly by

  or on behalf of any party where the costs of that party in respect of those acts or omissions may

  be disallowed and that costs occasioned by them to the other party shall be paid by him to that

  other party - Order 59 Rule 7(1): For instance, having acts done with a view to occasion

  unnecessary costs - Order 59 Rule 7(2)(b) ; omitting to do any thing the doing of which would have

  been calculated to save costs - Order 59 Rule 7(2)(a); and incurring unnecessary delays in the

  proceedings - Order 59 Rule 7(2)(c).

  </p><p align="justify">(3)    Whether costs have been incurred unreasonably or

  improperly in any proceedings where the solicitor responsible may have to personally bear the

  costs: Order 59 Rule 8.</p>
<p align="justify">(4)    Whether costs have been wasted by a failure to conduct

  proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition where the solicitor responsible may have to

  personally bear the costs: Order 59 Rule 8.</p>

  (5)    Without prejudice to Order 22A Rules 9 and 10, the court, in exercising its

  discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer

  was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiffs judgment is more

  favourable than the terms of the offer to settle: Order 22A Rule 12. An offer to settle is deemed

  to be an offer of compromise made without prejudice save as to costs: Order 22A Rule 4.

  <p align="justify">(6)    Without prejudice to Order 22A Rule 9 (1), (2) and (3),

  where an offer to settle has been made, and notwithstanding anything in the offer to settle, the

  court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid:

  Order 22 A Rule 9 (5).

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">40. The Court of Appeal in <i>Tullio v Maoro</i> <nobr>[1994] 2 SLR 489</nobr> referred to the

headnote in <i>Re Elgindata Ltd</i> [1993] 1 All ER 232 which neatly collated the relevant

principles governing the award of costs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The principles on which costs were to be awarded were (i) that costs were in

  the discretion of the court, (ii) that costs should follow the event except when it appeared to

  the court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made, (iii) that the

  general rule did not cease to apply simply because the successful party raised issues or made

  allegations that failed, but that he could be deprived of his costs in whole or in part where he

  had caused a significant increase in the length of the proceedings, and (iv) that where the

  successful party raised issues or made allegations improperly or unreasonably the court could not

  only deprive him of his costs but could also order him to pay the whole or part of the

  unsuccessful partys costs. The fourth principle implied, moreover, that a successful party who

  neither improperly nor unreasonably raised issues or made allegations which failed ought not to be

  ordered to pay any part of the successful partys costs</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">41. For the purpose of exercising its discretion on the award of costs, the court

is thus entitled to take account of the conduct of the parties before as well as during the trial

itself. I do not propose to give an exhaustive list, but it is useful to set out some of the

relevant conduct and circumstances. They include whether or not:</p>
<blockquote>

  (a)    Pre-trial procedures have on the whole been promptly and correctly adhered

  to, or disregarded most of the time;

  <p align="justify">(b)    Proper and full disclosure of all relevant documents and

  materials as part of the discovery process has been given;

  </p><p align="justify">(c)    Adequate accounts have been rendered and interrogatories

  answered with all the necessary information and details provided;

  </p><p align="justify">(d)    Ambush techniques or like strategies and late

  disclosures are deliberately resorted to, thereby prejudicing the fair, proper and expeditious

  disposal of the matter at hand;

  </p><p align="justify">(e)    Sufficient effort has been taken to ensure that all

  relevant and material facts have been included in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief to avoid

  causing delays and unnecessary surprises to the other party, thereby forcing him to take last

  minute instructions and conduct urgent further investigations in the course of the trial;

  </p><p align="justify">(f)    Portions of the claim or defence are wholly unrealistic

  or exaggerated;

  </p><p align="justify">(g)    Plainly unsustainable, unmeritorious or unreasonable

  issues have been put forward and argued at length;

  </p><p align="justify">(h)    The successful party has lost or abandoned issues which

  have consumed a substantial amount of the trial time;

  </p><p align="justify">(i)    Court time has been wasted by unnecessarily long-winded

  or repeated cross-examination, or by cross-examination on rather inconsequential and peripheral

  matters;

  </p><p align="justify">(j)    An excessive number of witnesses have been called to

  prove the same point or to prove rather inconsequential and peripheral matters or matters not

  really necessary to establish the partys case;

  </p><p align="justify">(k)    Costs and expense have been unnecessarily, unreasonably

  or improperly incurred;

  </p><p align="justify">(l)    There are last minute amendments of pleadings and

  inclusion of new heads of liability or damage at the trial itself;

  </p><p align="justify">(m)    Fresh evidence and new witnesses have been brought

  forward in the midst of the trial;

  </p><p align="justify">(n)    Strict proof of documents evidently authentic has been

  incessantly insisted upon when their authenticity could have been readily investigated and then

  agreed upon well before the trial;

  </p><p align="justify">(o)    The parties or their witnesses in conspiracy with the

  parties concerned have lied in evidence, fabricated evidence for use or misled the court, or have

  been dishonest in anyway. A successful party may be deprived of his costs if he presents a false

  case or false evidence (See <i>Baylis Baxter Ltd v Sabath</i> [1958] 2 All ER 209);

  </p><p align="justify">(p)    There is disgraceful behaviour deserving of moral

  condemnation so as to warrant denying costs in full or in part to the culpable party.

  </p><p align="justify">(q)    There is oppressive, unreasonable or unnecessarily

  argumentative behaviour, which has increased the costs of the litigation, or impeded the

  expeditious, fair and proper disposal of the case.

  </p><p align="justify">(r)    Intolerable or prejudicial conduct of the litigation of

  any kind is present;

  </p><p align="justify">(s)    The hearing has been prolonged through incompetence,

  negligence or simply dilatory conduct, and costs and expenses have been driven up by unnecessary

  delays, which are not limited to those that are inordinate, inexcusable or prejudicial, or caused

  by deliberate delaying tactics.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">42. In short, a successful party may be deprived of his costs in full or in part,

if its conduct has been sufficiently blameworthy. Disallowing his entitlement to costs is one way

that the court can effectively express its view of the misconduct of the successful party during the

pre-litigation or litigation process and show its displeasure. In an exceptional case, the court may

even order the successful party to pay the costs of the unsuccessful party.</p>
<p align="justify">43. The question before me is whether after taking into account all the relevant

factors including the non-conforming offer to settle, there is any sound basis to depart from the

normal order that the costs should follow the event, and whether there is sufficient reason to deny

any part of the costs of the successful plaintiff, or perhaps take an even more extreme and

exceptional measure to order the successful plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of the

unsuccessful defendant instead. In the absence of an enabling provision like Order 22A Rule 9, which

in this case has been specifically rendered inapplicable, I must exercise caution and have cogent

reasons before exercising my discretion to impose the extreme cost sanctions similar to those

available under Order 22A Rule 9 and order the successful plaintiff to pay the costs of the

unsuccessful 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, who has made the non-conforming offer.</p>
<p align="justify">44. In other words, where the failure to accept the non-conforming offer is so

unreasonable in all the circumstances of the case, it may justify a punitive award of post-offer

costs to the defendant offeror (offeror) when the plaintiff offeree (offeree) fails to

obtain a better result. However, where the circumstances merely show that the offeree should

reasonably have accepted the non-conforming offer, it may be sufficient to deprive the offeree of

his post-offer costs. But where it is reasonable in the circumstances of the case for the offeree to

reject the non-conforming offer, then the offeree should not be penalised in any way for not

accepting the offer, and he should still be entitled to his post-offer costs.</p>
<p align="justify">45. Counsel for the 1st defendant submitted strenuously that should the offer to

settle be found not to comply with Order 22A Rule 10, the court should still exercise its discretion

in favour of the 1st defendant and order the plaintiff to pay the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants costs

incurred from the 16 May 2000 although the plaintiff may keep his entitlement to costs up to that

date. In addition, counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant contended that the plaintiff lost on all

the major issues, which took most of the trial time. Further, the amount awarded was less than

$100,000, which would have been within the jurisdiction of the Subordinate Court. It was only for

about 3 % of the amount claimed. He argued that it would be outrageous to give costs of about

$400,000 or $500,000 where the judgment was for less than $100,000 and the plaintiff succeeded on

only a very small aspect of his claim, for which not much time was taken. Counsel even asked for

costs to be on the Subordinate Court scale and to have it apportioned.</p>
<p align="justify">46. Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant further pointed out that Order 22A

is relatively new, and there has been no case precedent in the context where the plaintiff had

wrongly joined a party as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. He submitted that in circumstances where

the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant wished and in fact offered to settle the whole of the proceedings but

the plaintiff refused to accept the offer, and as the event turned out, the judgment sum was

substantially less than the terms of the offer to settle, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant ought not to

be unfairly disadvantaged by the application of Order 22A Rule 10.</p>
<p align="justify">47. In the exercise of my discretion in relation to the costs incurred <b><u>after

the date of the offer</u></b> (of which there are broadly three options, namely, to award those

costs to the plaintiff, deprive the plaintiff his costs or part of his costs, or order the plaintiff

instead to pay the costs to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant), I have to consider the following factors

which are relevant in my view:</p>
<blockquote>

  (a)    In favour of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is the generous non-conforming

  offer he had made, which the plaintiff failed to beat. I recognise that it is an important

  consideration in the exercise of the courts discretion with regard to costs. But that

  non-conforming offer should only influence but not govern or dictate the exercise of discretion by

  the court.

  <p align="justify">(b)    As against that is the fact that the non-conforming offer

  only deals with the party and party costs of the plaintiff up to the date of service of the offer.

  Presumably, the offer was only for the getting up costs of only one counsel. However, my cost

  order was for two counsel. As such, if the pre-trial getting up cost of a second counsel for the

  plaintiff were to be included, the difference between the whole amount (including costs) actually

  awarded by the court and that offered by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant would be significantly

  reduced. One has to compare the offer as a whole including costs, and not merely that part

  relating to damages.

  </p><p align="justify">(c)    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant kept silent in his offer on

  how the costs of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants were to be settled. The terms of the offer called

  for a settlement of the proceedings, which suggests a complete withdrawal of the whole action

  against both defendants by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff were to release the 1<sup>st</sup>

  defendant upon acceptance of his offer to settle, the plaintiff must also release the hospital as

  the other alleged joint tortfeasor. But who then is to bear the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants

  costs? Is the plaintiff to assume that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants would not be asking for their

  costs upon a withdrawal of the plaintiffs claim? If not, is it going to be the 1<sup>st</sup>

  defendant or the plaintiff himself who has to pay the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants costs? It is of

  crucial importance therefore that a clear offer to settle be made with all the terms

  comprehensively set out. The offeree needs to know precisely what the terms are before he accepts

  the offer. In the event of default, the offeree must be able to enter judgment on the terms of the

  offer stated, whether or not it is an offer conforming to Order 22A Rule 10. Hence an offer to

  settle must be precise and unequivocal, particularly when there are many heads of claim and

  perhaps many defendants, not all of whom are joining in the offer to settle, and the settlement

  may well be with respect to certain heads of claim only. A precise offer with unequivocal terms

  also helps the court to determine whether the plaintiff has, on the action as a whole, obtained an

  order or a judgment sum (together with the interest awarded for the period before the service of

  the offer to settle), which is more favourable or less favourable than the terms of the offer. If

  the court cannot readily determine that because of incomplete terms or ambiguity, the court may

  disregard the offer and the offeror may well lose his cost advantage altogether. With the

  uncertainty or ambiguity in the offer from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in relation to the costs

  of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, and in the light of his non-compliance with Order 22A Rule 10, I

  could not to place too much weight on the non-conforming offer to settle.

  </p><p align="justify">(d)    Added to this is the fact that the revised offer was

  served on 16 May 2000 at the very doorstep of the trial fixed to commence on the following day.

  The last minute offer to settle only the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants portion of the claim puts

  the plaintiff in a difficult and embarrassing position. Given the shortness of time and the

  frenzied preparations for trial, would it be fair to expect the plaintiff to give the offer

  adequate and serious consideration? In <i>The Salavery</i> [1968] 1 Lloyds Rep 53, Brandon J

  rejected a submission that he should pay regard to an offer of settlement made only 11 days before

  the trial, and the rejection of that offer because it was not reasonable to expect decisions to be

  taken, particularly with foreign shipowners, in such a short time. Similarly, in <i>Colgate

  Palmolive Ltd v. Markwell Finance</i> [1990] R.P.C. 197, the offer of settlement "without

  prejudice save as to costs" afforded no basis for denying the plaintiffs their full costs of

  the actions when (a) the letter was sent five days before trial in which the plaintiffs had

  witnesses travelling from abroad; (b) the letter did not offer all the relief to which the

  plaintiffs were entitled; and (c) the offer related to only one of two products the subject-matter

  of the actions and a settlement on that basis would have had little effect on the length of trial

  (see White Book 1999 Vol 1 at para 62/9/4 at p 1139). Clearly, the plaintiff must be given the

  opportunity to properly assess and evaluate the offer. If not, the offeror only has himself to

  blame if the court would not exercise its discretion in his favour and grant him the cost

  advantages.

  </p><p align="justify">(e)    At this stage when the offer was served, the 1<sup>st</sup>

  defendant had not fully disclosed all the material facts of their defence known as the fall

  theory. The details of how he had operated on Mr Harte were also not fully disclosed. The

  brevity and lack of details of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants own affidavit of evidence-in-chief

  and those of his witnesses speak for themselves. In fact, at the trial I had to allow the

  plaintiff to recall his expert witnesses to give rebuttal evidence on areas which were not put to

  the plaintiffs expert witnesses earlier and which were alluded to only at the stage of the

  defence. Not apprised of the full extent of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants case, the plaintiff

  could not be said to be in a good position to assess the strength of his own case <i>vis--vis</i>

  that of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants in relation to all the facts and issues brought out in

  his statement of claim and the defence of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. In the circumstances and

  given the shortage of time, I did not think that the plaintiff was given a fair opportunity to

  evaluate the offer properly. In my opinion, the plaintiff had not acted unreasonably in refusing

  to accept the non-conforming offer to settle.

  </p><p align="justify">(f)    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had resorted to tendering at

  the last minute a number of medical authorities in support of his defence, which should have been

  given to the plaintiff well before hand. In the midst of the trial, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant

  notified that he intended to call an engineer in support of his fall theory. This put the

  plaintiff in a difficult position. In response, the plaintiff had to call a biomechanical engineer

  to testify for him on an urgent basis. The result was a flurry of new scientific papers submitted

  by the engineering experts and a computer modelling analysis was performed. A body scan to obtain

  the physical dimensions of the plaintiff had to be done. The trial was therefore lengthened

  considerably owing to the late calling of these engineers and the resulting interruptions, which I

  must say was caused by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. I allowed these new witnesses to testify as I

  felt their evidence would be relevant and be of assistance. But this aspect of getting up and

  planning should have been done during the pre-trial stages so that the trial can proceed smoothly

  and expeditiously. It seemed as if the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was doing intensive groundwork,

  research and investigations after the trial had begun, and was firming up his defence on the fall

  theory as the trial was progressing. Admittedly it was not easy for the 1<sup>st</sup>

  defendant to flesh out and piece together the fall theory he advanced. Nevertheless it

  seemed that much of the work was done on a last minute basis and in the course of the trial.

  </p><p align="justify">(g)    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant also brought out a surprise

  exhibit to which counsel for the plaintiff objected to on the basis of ambush litigation.

  </p><p align="justify">(h)    I have to consider also the fact that the plaintiff had

  lost on an important issue: that Dr Tan was negligent in his operation, which issue took a

  substantial amount of the trial time. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant on the other hand was trying to

  prove that the fall caused the injury instead. Both these issues of causation were closely

  intertwined. I had to deal with the surgery and the fall together to analyse the probabilities,

  and to establish which was the more likely cause. In my view, it was not unreasonable for the

  plaintiff to have alleged that Dr Tan was negligent during his surgery. As the operation was

  wholly within the control of Dr Tan, the plaintiff was not in a position to know and to prove what

  exactly had happened at the operation<i>. </i>How Dr Tan actually performed the surgery was by no

  means clear from the very brief contemporaneous notes he kept after the surgery. There were some

  circumstances causing the plaintiff to suspect that Dr Tan was not forthcoming and was hiding

  certain facts about the surgery from him during the post-operative treatment. I was not prepared

  in the circumstances to deny the plaintiffs costs on causation although the plaintiff lost on

  that issue because I did not regard that issue as one improperly or unreasonably raised by him.

  </p><p align="justify">(i)    Eventually I found Dr Tan to be negligent for not

  treating the plaintiff soon after the plaintiff reported to him of unusual pain and swelling in

  his scrotum on the morning after the surgery. Dr Tan was held liable for his poor post-operative

  care but not for his surgery. He must in substance be treated as one who had lost the action

  against the plaintiff<i>.</i> I thus regarded that the plaintiff was the successful party on the

  action as a whole despite having failed on the substantive issue of causation.

  </p><p align="justify">(j)    Dr Tan in his defence against any post-operative

  negligence had taken the position that Mr Harte never telephoned him to complain on the next day

  following the surgery, on which I found that Dr Tan had lied. I also found that Dr Tan had

  fabricated his clinical notes to state that there was "No pain". In court, Dr Tan

  maintained that Mr Harte was not in pain when he eventually saw him on the 4<sup>th</sup> day

  after the surgery, which evidence I disbelieved. His deplorable conduct at the trial to shift away

  his responsibility to attend to the patient after receiving the plaintiffs distress calls by

  falsely denying that he ever received them must be factored into the equation when determining if

  Dr Tan should be disallowed the attendant cost advantages flowing from his non-conforming offer to

  settle. In <i>Sutcliffe v Smith </i>(1886) 2 T.L.R. 881, Lord Justice Fry concurring with Lord

  Justice Bowen said that whenever a defendant had by his mis-statements, made under circumstances

  which imposed an obligation upon him to be truthful and careful in what he said, brought

  litigation on himself, and rendered the action reasonable, there would be "good cause"

  to deprive him of costs. If one looks at the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as being entitled to his

  costs because the plaintiff has failed to beat the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants offer to settle,

  the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant may be deprived of this cost benefit if his conduct was such that he

  had been dishonest, which he was found to be in relation to his insertion of "No pain"

  into his post-operative clinical notes when the plaintiff obviously was suffering from pain, and

  his insistence on the absence of any distress calls from the plaintiff in order to absolve himself

  of blame for his negligent post-operative care. Basically, I found that the 1<sup>st</sup>

  defendant lied in a material part of his testimony in court.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">48. Having regard to (h), (i) and (j) above, I found no good reason to disallow

any part of the costs of the plaintiff (in relation to his claim against the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant) incurred for getting up <b><u>prior to the service of the offer to settle</u></b>, which

the successful plaintiff would generally be entitled to as a matter of course.</p>
<p align="justify">49. As for the issue of the costs <b><u>after the service of the offer to settle</u></b>,

it was not an easy task trying to factor in all the matters from (a) to (j) above. On the whole, the

majority weighed against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. After carefully taking account of all the

factors, I exercised my discretion in favour of the plaintiff. I decided that on the whole, it would

be far more fair and equitable that the unsuccessful 1<sup>st</sup> defendant continues to bear the

post-offer costs of the successful plaintiff (again only in relation to the plaintiffs claim

against him), notwithstanding the rather generous non-conforming offer from the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant. I found insufficient reason to penalise the plaintiff in costs or to deprive him of his

post-offer costs, except in so far as his entire costs in relation to his separate claim against the

hospital were entirely excluded from the costs payable by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The

plaintiffs refusal to accept the non-conforming offer was reasonable in all the circumstances of

the case.</p>
<p align="justify">50. Dissatisfied, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant made an application for leave to

appeal solely against my order on costs against him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Leave to appeal on costs</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">51. Counsel for Dr Tan highlighted the case,<i> Buckle v Holmes </i>[1926] 2 KB

125 at 127, which was of assistance. There Banker LJ gave leave to appeal, not because there was any

real doubt about the law, but because the question was one of general importance and one upon which

further argument and a decision of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage.</p>
<p align="justify">52. Section 34(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Except with the leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge, no appeal shall be

  brought to the Court of Appeal </p>
<p align="justify">....</p>

  a.    where the only issue in the appeal relates to costs ..

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">53. In <i>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong &amp; Anor </i><nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 489</nobr>, Yong

Pung How CJ considered the principles concerning leave to appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">.. there are at least three limbs which can be relied upon when leave to appeal

  is sought: (1) <i>prima facie</i> case of error; (2) question of general importance decided for

  the first time; and (3) question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a

  higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is my opinion that leave to appeal on costs ought to be granted, relying upon

either the second or the third limb as stated by the Chief Justice.</p>
<p align="justify">54. Moreover, there was some compelling force in the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants

contention that the law does not expect the impossible to take place i.e. expect Dr Tan to pay the

costs of the hospital (which the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants counsel said may amount to some

$300,000) for no good legal reason, when both defendants rightly took the view that the hospital was

not vicariously liable at all to Mr Harte and that the hospital should not have been joined as a 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendant by Mr Harte. <i>Prima facie</i>, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant will never be able to make a

conforming and valid offer to settle the claim under Rule 10 when he has no wish to pay the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants costs under the circumstances aforesaid. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant will naturally

be insisting on his costs to be paid should the action be settled. How then is the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant to make an offer to settle such that he will be entitled to the cost consequences in Order

22A Rule 9 as a matter of course, and where it will no longer be a matter depending largely on the

wide discretion of the court? How is he to protect his position on costs and effectively put that

risk on costs on the plaintiff? Whether an offer to settle the entire action on the basis of an

offer of $300,000 plus all reasonable costs on a two counsel basis up to the date of offer but with

an express provision for the plaintiff to bear all the costs of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant may be

regarded as a proper conforming offer under Order 22A Rule 10 thereby invoking the cost consequences

in Rule 9 is difficult to say. What if the plaintiff had brought a claim of joint liability against

5 defendants, and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, in his offer to settle the whole claim for a

specific sum plus the plaintiffs costs, makes an offer to pay only the costs of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

and 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants but explicitly states that it is for the plaintiff himself to bear the

costs of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> defendants? Will these terms be clear enough for the

court, at the conclusion of the trial, to determine whether or not the plaintiff has effectively

beaten the offer? Will that be a sufficiently clear, unambiguous and complete offer to settle which

can then be given effect to under Order 22A Rules 9 and 10? If so, then the argument of impossibility

fails. If not, then perhaps the Rules themselves leave such complicated situations to be dealt with

more flexibly under the inherently wide discretion of the court as if they were Calderbank offers

(see <i>Calderbank v Calderbank</i> [1975] 3 W.L.R. 586).</p>
<p align="justify">55. Having regard to these legal questions, which I admit I have difficulty

grappling with, I thought it appropriate and justifiable to grant leave to appeal on costs, which I

did, so that some beneficial guidance would be available for parties finding themselves in similar

circumstances in the future. As is the modern practice, I fixed costs for the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants application for leave to be costs in the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">56. Since the costs incurred after the date of service of the offer to settle

could potentially amount to some S$250,000.00 (based on two counsel for some 31 days of trial),

which when added to those costs of Dr Tans own counsel that Dr Tan would not now recover from Mr

Harte, the difference in costs could be in the region of S$500,000. However, if the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants offer to settle is good and the plaintiff has to pay the costs of the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant instead, then it is going to be worse than a Pyrrhic victory for the plaintiff. In

substance, it is a ruinous and annihilating defeat, as he would be out of pocket by some $400,000

even after taking account of the judgment sum awarded. The financial consequences are indeed severe

and the matter is naturally of considerable importance to both parties, though I must emphasize that

it was not a factor I took into consideration when I granted leave to appeal on costs.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Stay of execution</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">57. The total judgment sum awarded was S$32,995.62 and US$36,589.25. In Singapore

dollars, this totalled approximately S$96,660 at the exchange rate of S$1.74 to US$1. Counsel for Dr

Tan applied for a stay of execution of the judgment sum pending his application for leave to appeal

on costs. He informed me that his client was not going to appeal on the question of liability, nor

on the amount of damages awarded. But if his clients appeal on costs were to be successful, there

might be nothing to pay over to the plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant essentially wanted to

stay the execution of the judgment sum, for which there was no appeal, in order to have security

against any costs payable by the plaintiff in the event that he succeeds on his appeal on costs. He

wanted to set off the judgment sum against the costs recoverable from the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">58. At first brush, it appeared odd that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who was not

going to appeal against liability or quantum of damages assessed should be asking to stay execution

of the judgment sum. Counsel for the plaintiff termed it a stay of execution <i>in vacuo</i>.

However, on reflection, I did not think that it was an application that could be dismissed outright

as being a non-starter. Where an appeal on costs alone, if allowed, results in the entire judgment

sum not payable to the plaintiff because the net costs in favour of the defendant exceed that

judgment sum, the defendant should not be precluded from making a stay of execution on the judgment

sum simply because he has not appealed against the judgment itself. Where the circumstances show

that a judgment sum paid over is not likely to be recoverable for setting off against the costs

payable and hence, the appeal on costs will be rendered nugatory in the event of a successful

appeal, I think the defendant has a sufficient basis to apply to stay the execution on the judgment

sum.</p>
<p align="justify">59. Order 57 Rule 15 states the general principle that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) Except so far as the Court below or the Court of Appeal may otherwise

  direct-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a.    an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of

    proceedings under the decision of the Court below;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">60. Section 41(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act also states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under

  the decision appealed from unless the court below or the Court of Appeal so orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">61. The position in Singapore was succinctly laid down by Yong Pung How CJ in <i>Lee

Sian Hee v Oh Kheng Soon </i><nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 77</nobr> at p 78H:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whilst the court has power to grant a stay, and this is entirely in the

  discretion of the court, the discretion must be exercised in accordance with well established

  principles (<i>Lee Kuan Yew v J B Jeyaratnam </i><nobr>[1990] SLR 740</nobr>; <nobr>[1991] 1 MLJ 83</nobr>). First, as a

  general proposition, the court does not deprive a successful litigant of the fruits of his

  litigation, and lock up the funds to which <i>prima facie</i> he is entitled, pending an appeal (<i>The

  Annot Lyle </i>(1886) 1 PD 114 at 116). However, when a party is exercising his undoubted right

  of appeal, the court ought to see that the appeal, if successful, is not nugatory (<i>Wilson v

  Church (No2) </i>(1879) 12 Ch D 454 at 458-459). Thus, a stay will be granted if it can be shown

  by affidavit that, if the damages and costs are paid, there is no reasonable probability of

  getting them back, if the appeal succeeds (<i>Atkins v Great Western Railway Co </i>(1886) 2 TLR

  400).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">62. The Chief Justice continued at p 80:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the affidavit filed, there are no indications of special circumstances other

  than the alleged likelihood of success in the appeal  the likelihood of success is not by

  itself sufficient, even in the context of an appeal against a summary judgmentIf a bald

  assertion of the likelihood of success is adequate, then a stay would be granted in every case,

  for every appellant must expect that his appeal will succeed (<i>Atkins v Great Western Railway Co</i>).

  This is quite contrary to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, the Rules of the Supreme Court, and

  to established case law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">63. This was followed in <i>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte

Ltd </i><nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 233</nobr>. The court, in every case, will have to examine the facts to see if special

circumstances justifying the grant of a stay of execution exists: <i>Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd v LKM

Investment Holdings Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 701</nobr> at 705H. Halsbury Laws of England 4<sup>th</sup>

Edn (1976) Vol 17 para 451 at p 270 states that the special circumstances which entitle the court to

stay execution of a money judgment are circumstances which go to the enforcement of the judgment and

not those which go to its validity or correctness. In other words, the existence of strong grounds

for an appeal based on the incorrectness or invalidity of a judgment does not constitute a special

circumstance upon which a stay of execution pending appeal should be granted. (See also <i>Lee Kuan

Yew v Jeyaretnam JB</i> <nobr>[1991] 1 MLJ 83</nobr> at p 85.)</p>
<p align="justify">64. The mere fact that the plaintiffs are a foreign company is insufficient in

itself to justify a stay of execution: <i>Exim Sales Corporation v Dolly Enterprises Pte Ltd </i>(15

May 1997 in S150/96). I was also referred to the judgment of Abdul Malik Ishak J in <i>Wu Shu Chen v

Raja Zainal Abidin bin Raja Hussin &amp; Anor </i><nobr>[1995] 3 MLJ 224</nobr> where it was stated that although

what may amount to special circumstances is a question of fact in each case, it must be something

distinctive and out of the way. The fact that a large amount of money is involved does not per se

constitute a special circumstance: <i>Eng Yam Construction Sdn Bhd v TAP Properties Sdn Bhd</i>

digested in 2 Mallals Digest (4<sup>th</sup> Edn, 1994 Reissue) para 1363.</p>
<p align="justify">65. The main factors relied upon by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in his stay

application were that the plaintiff is a United States (US) national, and that enforcement of

a successful appeal in the US would be inconvenient and difficult. There was however no evidence

that the plaintiff was financially insolvent. Neither was there evidence that the plaintiff, being a

successful and experienced commodity trader having a reputation to maintain, would attempt to do

anything as to render any possible successful appeal nugatory. Nor was there evidence that he would

likely abscond with the judgment sum and make himself untraceable in the event of a successful

appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">66. Weighing all the relevant factors carefully, it was my conclusion that the

application for stay was not supported by any argument, let alone any evidence, that could amount to

special circumstances justifying a stay of execution. Mere inconvenience and difficulty of having to

bring proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction to recover is not a sufficient circumstance justifying a

stay without more. Unless that judgment sum paid over was also likely to be unrecoverable, I would

not regard the appeal on costs, if successful, to be rendered nugatory or partially nugatory, if no

stay was granted. In this case, the judgment sum awarded of S$32,995.62 and US$36,589.25 plus

interest was not particularly large relative to the present salary of the plaintiff in New York at

US $77,800 per annum excluding bonus. I also noted that the plaintiff has a house in the United

States. As such, I did not think that Mr Harte is a man without the means to repay this judgment sum

in the event of a successful appeal. What counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant managed to put

forward was a possibility that the plaintiff could become insolvent and that it would be

inconvenient to bring recovery proceedings in the United States, should the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant

succeed in his appeal on costs. These were clearly insufficient for the court to exercise its

discretion to grant a stay of execution. This was not a case of a summary judgment or a judgment in

default but a judgment after a trial of 31 days where the issues on liability, assessment of damages

and costs had been carefully considered. I did not think I should deprive the successful plaintiff

of the fruits of his hard fought victory just because of a pending appeal on costs, where the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant, if successful on the appeal, might recover an amount in costs exceeding the amount of

damages awarded to the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">67. In the circumstances, I dismissed the application for a stay of execution. I

also fixed the costs for this application at $1,500, to be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to

the plaintiff.</p>
