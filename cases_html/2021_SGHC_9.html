class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 This Suit arises from a long-standing and bitter dispute relating to the construction of three two-storey good class bungalows (Units 12, 12A and 12B) at 12 Leedon Park, Lot 98388L Mukim 04 (the “Project”) at an agreed lump sum price of $13,130,000. The Project is owned by the defendant, Mr Ser Kim Koi. The plaintiff, GTMS Construction Pte Ltd, was the main contractor for the Project. The first third party, Chan Sau Yan Associates (a sole proprietorship wholly owned by Mr Chan Sau Yan Sonny), was the architect for the Project. The relationship between the defendant, the first third party and the plaintiff started out well. However, towards the end of the Project there was mistrust and the relationship between the defendant and the first third party together with the plaintiff went south. The defendant’s allegations of a web of conspiracy and a multitude of lies now hang over the parties’ interactions. Intertwined within these allegations are complex questions of interpretation involving the Singapore Institute of Architects’ Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) (9th Ed, September 2010) (the “SIA Conditions”) and the implications arising therefrom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this Suit, the plaintiff claims for unpaid sums from the defendant. The unpaid sums arise from two interim payment claims and the final payment claim which were certified by the first third party (the “certified payment claims”). The plaintiff claims an aggregate sum of $1,103,915.48 plus interest from the defendant. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the certified payment claims. He also refused to pay the first third party’s unpaid fees of $60,990 plus interest.

</div>
</div> The defendant asserts that the plaintiff and the third parties had conspired to injure him and are liable to him under the tort of unlawful means conspiracy. As a corollary of that conspiracy, the defendant claims that the first third party had, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, granted extensions of time improperly, works which were deficient were certified as satisfactory, defects were not rectified and the Project was certified to have been completed when it was clearly not safe for occupation. The defendant further claims against the third parties for breach of their contractual and tortious duties owed to the defendant. The defendant also has a counterclaim against the plaintiff for rectification of defective works and liquidated damages for the delay in the completion of the Project. The defendant also claims an indemnity from the third parties for any liability arising on the part of the plaintiff to the defendant, and also for all the legal costs incurred by the defendant in defending the summary judgment application initiated by the plaintiff against the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The first third party, Chan Sau Yan Associates, was a sole proprietorship wholly owned by Mr Chan Sau Yan Sonny (TPW2, “Mr Chan”).

The defendant does not rely on any one particular incident to support his conspiracy claim. Instead, he relies on his opinionated allegations and personal inferences to establish that there was a conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party to injure him. Further, arising out of the same facts, the defendant also alleges that the plaintiff and the third party had breached their contractual and/or tortious duties owed to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The defendant in his pleadings and affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) did not make any allegations against the tender process. However, in the course of his testimony in court, the defendant alleged that the conspiracy to injure and defraud him by the plaintiff and the third party started from the tender process of the Project. The defendant also asserted in court that the plaintiff had bribed the third party in the course of the Project (the “Bribery Allegation”), although this particular allegation was later retracted.

</div> This request was made repeatedly at the following site meetings, as reflected in the minutes. Accordingly, far from supporting the defendant’s conspiracy allegation, the third party’s evaluation process in EOT 1 illustrates its professional and independent assessment of the plaintiff’s EOT requests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, the plaintiff contends that there were indeed genuine and legitimate reasons for its application for EOT 1 on account of the delay by the defendant in marble selection and confirmation, thereby affecting marble delivery. According to the plaintiff, the screeding work progress includes various areas for laying marble, ceramic tile and timber parquet and the sequence of work started from the laying of the marble. At the material time when the plaintiff applied for EOT 1, it had yet to receive 70% of the marble required to complete the Project.

This included quality checks, defect rectification such as pin-hole patching, fissure or open vein patching, polishing, cutting to size as per shop drawing, colour tone matching, and finally the packing of the marble pieces for delivery to the worksite.

The plaintiff agrees with the third party.

This may be inferred from the circumstances and the acts of the alleged conspirators, but such inference can only be drawn from overt acts (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>”) at [347]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the plaintiff and the third party had the intention to cause damage or injury to the defendant by those acts.

This claim is premised on the plaintiff and the third party committing fraud on the defendant. In this regard, the elements of fraud were set out by Lord Herschell in <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek </span>(1889) 14 App Cas 337 at 374, cited also in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) ([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[F]raud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) <span class="font-italic">recklessly, careless whether it be true or false</span>. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Further, the nature of the evidence required to establish fraud is well established. As stated by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 110 at [18]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is trite that a finding of fraud is a serious matter and although the civil standard of balance of probabilities applies, <span class="font-italic">the evidence must be strong and cogent before such a finding is justified</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This principle was explained by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [14] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [B]ecause of the severity and potentially serious implications attaching to a fraud, even in a civil trial, judges are not normally satisfied by that little bit more evidence such as to tilt the ‘balance’.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The defendant was the only factual witness who testified in support of his claim in unlawful means conspiracy. Although he had engaged Assistants who were his personal private advisers to closely monitor the progress of the construction of the Project, he did not call them as his witnesses.

Secondly, that there was an intention to cause injury to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I accept that an agreement between conspirators is often tacit and conceived in private (see <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent Logistics Pte Ltd and another v Singapore Agro Acricultural Pte Ltd and others </span>[2014] 4 SLR 1208 at [51]). Thus, I appreciate that it might be difficult to provide direct evidence of a concrete or tangible agreement being reached by all the conspirators (see <span class="font-italic">Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the estates of Shaikah Fitom bte Ghalib bin Omar Al-Bakri and others) and others v Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and others and other suits </span>[2017] 3 SLR 386 at [60]). However, it must be emphasised that a “mere unsubstantiated assertion is clearly insufficient. And even something that goes a little more beyond mere assertion is still insufficient” (see <span class="font-italic">Wu Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jingyi Group Co, Ltd and others </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 451 at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, the evidence of conspiracy and fraud adduced by the defendant was wholly speculative and spurious. Having regard to the lack of veracity and credibility of his evidence, I find that the defendant has failed to discharge his burden to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an agreement, whether expressly or impliedly, between the plaintiff and the third party to defraud or injure the defendant. Neither did the defendant establish on a balance of probabilities any of the other requirements of a claim in unlawful means conspiracy. The strength and cogency of the evidence that was furnished by the defendant to support his allegations of conspiracy and/or fraud are far from adequate. I should add that even if the nature of evidence required were similar to that in a normal civil action, the defendant would still have failed to establish that the plaintiff and the third party were in a conspiracy to defraud him. I shall now explain my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My general findings in relation to the conspiracy claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Even before turning to the numerous specific allegations raised by the defendant, set out at [383]–[576] below, I set out my general findings with regard to the overarching conspiracy claim that allegedly tainted the entire Project from the very beginning (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tender process) to the end (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the issuance of the CC, the MC, and the FC by the third party). Firstly, I find that the defendant had a propensity to rely on speculations and suspicions that were not supported by any reliable evidence. Secondly, the defendant’s narrative, particularly regarding his allegations of conspiracy, was very incredible. Lastly, the defendant also refused to call any of his Assistants, whom he had engaged to safeguard his interests in this Project, to testify on his behalf. This is highly suspicious as these Assistants would be the very individuals who would be able to support any claims he had in relation to his allegation of conspiracy. I shall elaborate on each of these general findings in greater detail in the following sections.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant had a proclivity for speculations and suspicions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendant had a propensity to make reckless and speculative allegations, despite knowing that these allegations and suspicions were tenuous and unsupported by evidence.

This can only be described as bizarre if he had, indeed, known that he was a victim of a conspiracy to defraud him at the nascent stage of the Project. This aspect of the allegations he made in court is not in the defendant’s pleadings or in his AEIC.

In his pleadings and AEIC, the defendant alleges that the conspiracy involved only the plaintiff and the third party.

This was also the position taken in the defendant’s opening statement. There was not the slightest hint that the Consultants, excluding Web, were co-conspirators as well. However, when cross-examined by the third party’s counsel, the defendant then expanded the number of conspirators to almost every professional involved in the Project. The only individuals who were spared were Jessie Tan (TPW8, “Ms Tan”) from Web, the defendant’s wife and his Assistants. The defendant took the position that eight other professionals involved in the Project were all lying and he was the only factual witness that was telling the truth.

He said he was asked to do so by Mr Sankar (one of the plaintiff’s staff), who informed him that Ms Chua had asked him to sign. As Ms Chua was the M&amp;E engineer and his superior in the Project, RTO Leong felt pressured to comply.

The defendant alleges that RTO Leong sought the plaintiff’s assistance to repair the leaks in RTO Leong’s house. When RTO Leong was asked in court about this matter, he said that the plaintiff was called to repair leaks in the defendant’s house. Thus, it is unclear whether it was the defendant’s house that was leaking or RTO Leong’s. There was no contemporaneous evidence of the defendant’s claim in this regard beyond his own assertion, which is, at its very best, questionable. Even if the defendant were to be believed, it is incredible that he was able to infer that there was a conspiracy simply because the plaintiff had separately assisted RTO Leong to repair the leak in the latter’s house.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Similar to what the defendant had done with F+G, he had in fact employed RTO Leong <span class="font-italic">directly </span>to work for him, <span class="font-italic">after</span> RTO Leong was released from the Project on 1 July 2013.

However, when the defendant was cross-examined on their exact role in the Project, the defendant sought to significantly downplay their roles. The inference is clear. Should he call these Assistants to testify, his case, particularly the serious allegations of conspiracy and fraud on the part of the plaintiff and the third party, would be severely undermined. The Assistants were the very individuals best placed to establish the presence of a conspiracy, as they would have been well-apprised of the development of the Project and could bear witness to everything alongside the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I begin with Mr Chow, who attended most of the site meetings.

Firstly, from these affidavits, Mr Cheung was his adviser and did not merely have administrative or secretarial duties. Secondly, Mr Cheung was for all intents and purposes the defendant’s right-hand man. Mr Cheung was the defendant’s “main agent” whom he relied on to communicate with the plaintiff, the third party and the Consultants. Thirdly, Mr Cheung has specialised knowledge and experience in construction matters. Finally, Mr Cheung was heavily involved in the Project and was clearly an integral part of the defendant’s team helping the defendant to closely monitor the progress of the Project. The numerous contemporaneous e-mails that were sent during the construction of the Project by Mr Cheung to the plaintiff, the third party and others involved in the Project clearly show that he played an important and active role on behalf of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In his affidavits dated 20 March 2017 and 20 April 2017, the defendant was trying to convince the court that Mr Cheung had played an integral role in the Project. This was to persuade the court that Mr Cheung should be allowed to accompany the defendant to inspect the third party’s documents. Thus, it is clear that the defendant was content to tailor his evidence at different stages of the case to suit his needs. When his contradictions were exposed and made obvious to any reasonable person, the defendant audaciously denied the contradictions. The defendant’s contradictions were clear as day and he failed to provide satisfactory explanations. In addition to bringing into question his entire claim of conspiracy, his credibility and reliability as a witness were significantly undermined by his evasiveness and vacillating testimony during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In response to my question, the defendant again maintained his incredible story that his Assistants (including Mr Cheung) merely played minor roles, and that he (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant) was the only one who knew about the conspiracy against him:

Did you tell any of your advisers, personal advisers?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: I don’t think I tell. But each time when – after meeting, Wilson just shake his leg – head and I shake mine and we just smile and we disperse.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: Isn’t it important for you to share your suspicion with your advisers?

His role is not advising.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Even taking his evidence at its highest, the defendant alleged that the body language of Mr Cheung showed that he shared the defendant’s sentiments or interpretation, or at the very least was unhappy about the way in which the plaintiff and the third party were operating the Project. If that were true, it demonstrates that there was a general dissatisfaction towards the plaintiff and the third party. This would only serve to bolster the defendant’s claim of a conspiracy and would have been best illustrated by calling his Assistants as witnesses. The fact that he refused to call any of his Assistants as witnesses only goes towards showing that the allegations of conspiracy never existed during the Project. Such allegations only arose after the plaintiff requested for payment pursuant to the last three payment certificates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Having made these general observations regarding the defendant’s allegations of conspiracy, I shall now make some general observations of the defendant’s case as a whole, before turning to examine the relationship between the defendant and the third party.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My general observations of the defendant’s case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Notwithstanding that the third party was engaged by the defendant, the trust between them slowly eroded towards the end of the Project. When the defendant made excessive demands and unreasonably rejected the rectification works of the plaintiff, he expected the third party to be on his side. However, the third party exercised its professional and independent judgment and found that the rectifications were satisfactory. This infuriated the defendant who became extremely upset and made outrageous and baseless allegations that the defendant and the third party were in a conspiracy to defraud and collude against him, and that the third party was not impartial. I find that most of the defendant’s allegations are unfounded. There is no iota of evidence, not even circumstantial evidence, to support the hugely serious allegations of conspiracy to defraud, corruption and collusion between the plaintiff and the third party. It seems that the defendant has no qualms about carrying out these shenanigans against the plaintiff and the third party even when he knows that he has no evidence to substantiate them. When the other Consultants came forward as witnesses to support the plaintiff’s and the third party’s version of events, the defendant decided to tar everyone with the same brush, asserting without any shred of evidence that they were all parties to an alleged conspiracy to harm him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It is very difficult to believe the defendant’s allegations of conspiracy. The cogent evidence suggests to me that this conspiracy never existed in reality as it is a figment of the defendant’s imagination arising from his suspicions of the plaintiff, the third party and the Consultants as they resisted his unreasonable conduct. When the plaintiff sought from the defendant payment for the last few certified payment claims, the defendant decided to use the conspiracy claim as a shield for him to avoid any liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 On the contrary, the evidence shows that the plaintiff and the third party as well as the Consultants were dealing with each other at arm’s length and they behaved professionally throughout the Project. The third party may have been negligent in certain aspects of his duties in this Project, for instance, the failure to know the existence of Item 72 of the Preliminaries in the Contract. However, these lapses certainly were not deliberately or intentionally done to cause harm to the defendant, who was his principal and with whom he had a contractual relationship. There was no contractual nexus between the plaintiff and the third party. There was no reason for the third party to favour the plaintiff unless the allegations by the defendant have some truth, which is not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I shall begin with my assessment of the defendant’s credibility and veracity as a witness. The defendant was extensively and thoroughly cross-examined by the plaintiff’s and the third party’s respective counsel over 13 days. I had ample opportunities to evaluate the defendant’s credibility and reliability. However, I did not find the defendant to be a credible or reliable witness. The defendant’s testimony was riddled with internal inconsistencies as there were numerous contradictions for which he could not provide a reasonable or satisfactory explanation. This diminished his credibility as a witness. When confronted with his own shifting evidence and the objective correspondence and documents during cross-examination, the defendant was often evasive. In fact, I note that this is not the first time such observations have been made of the defendant’s credibility. In <span class="font-italic">Holland Leedon Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v C &amp; P Transport Pte Ltd </span>[2013] SGHC 281, in which the defendant had testified as a witness, Lionel Yee JC observed at [152] that the defendant “seemed to be unable to recall many things and often appeared to be <span class="font-italic">asserting what he thought ought to be the case rather than what he could specifically remember the facts to be</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 To further his campaign against the plaintiff and the third party, the defendant sought the help of Mr Chin Cheong (DW7, “Mr Chin”), the managing director of BAPL and the defendant’s expert witness, to identify as many defects as possible in the Project. In December 2013, Mr Chin was engaged by the defendant to identify all defects and suggest methods of rectification. Subsequently, Mr Chin compiled his first findings in Building Appraisal Pte Ltd Report December 2013 (the “2013 BAPL Report”).

The investigations entailed multiple site visits and resulted in extensive reports compiled by Mr Chin. In each subsequent report, Mr Chin’s findings became more detailed, zooming into even the minutest of details, as he was enormously pedantic. It was a massive hunt for the slightest defects that included the use of precision equipment such as a digital Vernier caliper for the steps and risers, which is not used in the construction industry for the measurement of steps and risers.

The defendant also refused to activate the various warranties from the different NSCs to rectify the purportedly defective works. He allowed the units to deteriorate and attempts to pin the blame on the plaintiff.

</div> It is clear that the equity of the case is not with the defendant’s claims against the plaintiff and the third party. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The defendant’s refusal to mitigate his losses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 It is oft-said that the requirement to mitigate is strictly speaking not a positive legal duty but an expression of the principle that an aggrieved party cannot recover damages in respect of losses it could have reasonably avoided (see <span class="font-italic">The Enterprise Fund II Ltd v Jong Hee Sen </span>[2020] 3 SLR 419 at [86]; <span class="font-italic">Golden Strait Corpn v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha </span>[2007] 2 AC 353 at [10]). In <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span>”), the CA set out the rules relating to the principle of mitigation. The CA observed at [24], [30] and [32] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 The basic rules relating to mitigation are well settled. First, the aggrieved party must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the defaulting party’s breach, and cannot recover damages for any loss which it could have avoided but failed to avoid due to its own unreasonable action or inaction ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 … [T]he singular practical focus of the central inquiry which lies at the heart of this principle … [is] <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether or not the aggrieved party acted reasonably to mitigate its loss</span> … Reasonableness forms the one identifiable foundation on which this inquiry – and, in turn, the principle of mitigation – rests. The central question which underpins the reasonableness inquiry is what a reasonable and prudent man in the trade would have done in the ordinary course of his business if he had been in the aggrieved party’s shoes …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 … [T]he inquiry amounts to nothing more than the common law’s attempt to reflect <span class="font-italic">commercial and fact-sensitive fairness</span> at the remedial stage of a legal inquiry into the extent of liability on the defaulting party’s part. The concept of reasonableness in the context of mitigation is a flexible one. In essence, it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">bars an aggrieved party from profiting or behaving unreasonably at the expense of the defaulting party</span>, and encapsulates complex interplaying notions of responsibility and fairness. As with any principle of law that encapsulates notions of fairness, the principle of mitigation confers on the courts considerable discretion in evaluating the facts of the case at hand in order to arrive at a commercial just determination. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As seen from the above, the inquiry at this stage is extremely fact-centric and focuses on the reasonableness of the aggrieved party’s conduct. It is also pertinent to note the CA’s further observations at [45] regarding aggrieved parties who take <span class="font-italic">no mitigating action </span>at all:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … [W]hile it may be a general principle of the law on mitigation that the court will not nicely weigh on sensitive scales the measures taken by an aggrieved party to mitigate its loss, this principle will ordinarily apply more strongly in cases where the question before the court is whether the aggrieved party engaged in unreasonable <span class="font-italic">action </span>as opposed to unreasonable <span class="font-italic">inaction</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Once the defaulting party establishes that the aggrieved party had reasonable options before it, greater justification will usually be needed from the aggrieved party</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">which, despite knowing that it must act reasonably to mitigate its loss, does nothing at all</span>. … [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Till this date, the defendant has made no efforts to mitigate his losses by carrying out defect rectification works.

</div> However, the defendant’s assertion that the units are unsafe clearly holds no water, given that the units had been awarded the TOP as early as 16 September 2013. In fact, one of the non-compliances required by the BCA to be rectified before TOP could be issued was precisely the uneven steps and risers. The fact that the BCA subsequently issued the TOP, after the steps and risers were rectified, demonstrates that the BCA found them to be compliant and, therefore, safe. Furthermore, the defendant’s claim was clearly rebutted by his own witness, Mr Teo, who testified that he was able to climb the stairs of the three units safely to inspect the unit, despite his age:

Even if he held the view that the defects substantially reduced the rental value of the units, this did not mean that he could simply refuse to mitigate his losses by not renting out the units. The units could still fetch a high rent, as Mr Teo testified:

It's quite okay. You can occupy the – you know, you can – it's fit for occupation and because there's no furnishings of course. It don't look that good but you know most houses when they rent out, they are fully furnished.

</div> However, I emphasise that the crucial time of assessment of damages remains in the year 2014. This was the year in which the Project was handed over to the defendant. It would be grossly unfair if the plaintiff and the third party were found liable for any defects not arising from the plaintiff’s construction error which may have occurred since that date, especially the purported defects reported in 2018, when the defendant deliberately allowed the units in the Project to deteriorate. The defendant attempted to introduce certain defects discovered at various points in time from 2014 to date. This attempt by the defendant is not equitable as the defects could have been the result of the defendant’s deliberate refusal to maintain the Project, rather than due to the plaintiff’s construction errors. Therefore, the defendant’s reliance on expert reports and photographs of alleged defects <span class="font-italic">after</span> 2014 must be treated with extreme caution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The defendant’s insistence on absolute rectification</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The defendant also unreasonably insists on total and absolute rectification of all the defects alleged by him. For example, the defendant claims that the plaintiff should compensate him for the defects in the Volakas marble on the basis of a full replacement of the Volakas marble in the Project, which costs $528,578.20.

A subcontractor sought to claim payment from the developer, notwithstanding that the subcontract had been concluded between the subcontractor and the main contractor. The subcontractor claimed that there had been an implied novation of the subcontract. Prakash J rejected this, noting at [15]–[16] that negotiations to reach an express novation agreement had been unsuccessful and both parties recognised that no express novation had occurred. Furthermore, Prakash J found that the subcontractor’s taking of instructions from the developer, and the developer’s giving of instructions to the subcontractor, did not amount to an implied novation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In this case, a deed of novation was forwarded to the defendant on 20 December 2011. This deed of novation would have contractually transferred to the second third party all of the first third party’s rights, duties and obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the defendant arising from the MOA . However, the defendant failed to sign and return the deed of novation. This was done at his own choice, as he explained in court:

Given that the defendant himself had rejected the deed of novation, it is now disingenuous for him to turn around and seek to bind the second third party to the first third party’s obligations under the MOA. Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that there was an oral or implied novation. In this respect, the defendant contends that the representatives of the second third party continued to deal with the defendant in relation to the Project under the second third party’s electronic signature and the defendant made payment for services rendered for the Project directly to the second third party.

To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger. He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself. The representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract. It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The CA then concluded that there were two requirements for the doctrine of apparent authority to apply: (a) there must have been a representation made by the principal that the agent had the authority to enter into the relevant transactions on its behalf; and (b) the contractor must have relied on this representation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The doctrine of apparent authority is significant because as regards some of the defendant’s allegations against the plaintiff, the plaintiff had acted on the third party’s instructions. I find that by appointing the third party as his architect, the defendant represented to the plaintiff that the third party had the authority to give such instructions. This is also reflected in several parts of the Contract. In particular, cl 1(1) of the SIA Conditions states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Written and Verbal Directions and Instructions. </span>The Contractor shall at all times carry out, bring to completion, and maintain the Works in accordance with all the requirements of the Contract and must … <span class="font-italic">comply with all written directions and instructions given in relation thereto by the Architect</span>. … [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> By complying with the architect’s instructions, the plaintiff relied on the defendant’s representation. As such, as between the defendant and the plaintiff, the defendant is bound by the instructions given by the third party to the plaintiff. However, the defendant may still seek recourse against the third party if the third party was negligent or in breach of contract by issuing such instructions, or if the defendant’s claim of unlawful means conspiracy is made out. I shall elaborate on this below in relation to the specific issues and claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tender process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I shall now examine closely the other allegations made by the defendant to support his conspiracy claim, beginning from the tender process. The defendant alleges that the conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party started from the tender process. Here, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff, the third party and Ms Chua from CCA conspired to award the tender to the plaintiff. The defendant drew these conclusions on the basis that the tender was conducted improperly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Having examined the contemporaneous correspondence and documents, I reject the defendant’s allegation of a conspiracy at the tender stage. There was nothing improper about the tender process. In fact, the entire tender process supports the plaintiff’s and the third party’s case that there was no conspiracy to injure the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The defendant alleges that the third party had “pushed” for the plaintiff to be appointed, instead of Soil-Build or Daiya. Specifically, the defendant relies on the following statements made by the third party in the e-mails dated 4 May 2011 and 9 May 2011:

There is not an iota of evidence to suggest that the third party did not perform its duty honestly and independently in the exercise of its professional judgment. The third party informed the defendant that the plaintiff had submitted the lowest tender. The third party also took into account CCA’s final tender report for M&amp;E installations. CCA made an independent assessment that the plaintiff had the most competitive bid for M&amp;E installations and that its tender submission was “generally complete and in compliance with the tender specifications”.

</div> The third party did not state that the plaintiff must be appointed. It was always open for the defendant, the owner of the Project, to reject the third party’s recommendation and proceed to appoint Soil-Build. The evidence further shows that the defendant applied his mind to the selection of the plaintiff and participated in the tender interview. He also requested the financial information of the plaintiff as part of this process. At any point in time, the defendant was free to ask for further documents had he not been satisfied with the selection of the plaintiff.

</div> Having considered the parties’ submissions, I find that cl 23(1)(a) is operative and applies in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 I turn first to the issue of whether cl 23(1)(a) is operative and enforceable. In my view, the defendant’s argument that cl 23(1)(a) is rendered unenforceable for lack of definition does not hold water. The meaning of the term <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> is generally understood. In Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Construction Contracts Dictionary</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Construction Contracts Dictionary</span>”) at p 198, the term <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> is explained in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… An event beyond the control of either of the parties to the contract, the effect of which is to release the parties from performing their remaining obligations under the contract. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Similarly, <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 2 (Lexis Nexis, Singapore) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>”) at para 30.112 states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Force majeure has been described as ‘a reference to all circumstances independent of the will of man’. Whether a particular event constitutes force majeure under any given contract turns on the construction of the force majeure clause in the context of the other terms of the contract as well as the relationship of the parties. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A force majeure clause therefore affords ‘a more nuanced response’ to events which were completely unexpected and beyond the control of either party. Thus a standard form of construction contract may provide for the completion date to be extended on account of force majeure and this preserves the operation of the other terms of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In relation to this “standard form of construction contract”, the learned author of <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>referred to cl 14.2 of the Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract (7th Ed, 2014).

The court is, in accordance with the principle of freedom of contract, to give full effect to the intention of the parties in so far as such a clause is concerned. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 … In this regard, it is important to note that, by their <span class="font-italic">very nature and function</span>, <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clauses would – in the ordinary course of events – be triggered only where there was a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">radical external event that supervened and that was not due to the fault of either of the contracting parties</span>. ... As S Rajendran J observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Magenta Resources (S) Pte Ltd v China Resources (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 316 … :</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is referred to as <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>in our law … is really no more than a convenient way of referring to contractual terms that the parties have agreed upon to deal with situations that might arise, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">over which the parties have little or no control, that might impede or obstruct the performance of the contract</span>. There can therefore be no general rule as to what constitutes a situation of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>. Whether such a (<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>) situation arises, and, where it does arise, the rights and obligations that follow, would all depend on what the parties, in their contract, have provided for. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[CA’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Thus, a <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> event generally refers to an event that impedes or obstructs the performance of the contract, which was out of the parties’ control and occurred without the fault of either party. Whether a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event arises is ultimately a matter of construction based on the facts of each case, with a view to giving effect to the parties’ intentions. Furthermore, the element of unforeseeability is not strictly necessary. As the CA in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>observed at [56], a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>clause is “an agreement as to how outstanding obligations should be resolved upon the onset of a <span class="font-italic">foreseeable </span>event” [emphasis in original].

</div>
</div> In this regard, the CA distinguished the concept of <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>from the related doctrine of frustration, in which the element of unforeseeability is critical. However, a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event is typically “radical” (see<span class="font-italic"> RDC Concrete </span>at [57]). Borrowing from the doctrine of frustration, this refers to where “the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract” (see <span class="font-italic">Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council </span>[1956] AC 696 at 729, cited by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Glahe International Expo AG v ACS Computer Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 945 at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The court should be slow to find the <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> clause unenforceable on the basis that it is not defined in the Contract. In the absence of any contractual definition, I find it appropriate to construe the clause based on its general and established meaning as set out at [197] above – an event that was radical and out of the parties’ control, which occurred without either party’s fault.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The scope and coverage of the term <span class="font-italic">f</span><span class="font-italic">orce majeure </span>in cl 23(1)(a) has to be considered in the context of the entirety of cl 23(1) which deals with EOT in the SIA Conditions. Clause 23(1) lists out various instances in which EOT may be granted. It is also important to note that cl 23(1) is derived from the standard SIA Conditions which are often incorporated into construction contracts. In other words, cl 23(1) is not a bespoke contractual term specially contemplated by the plaintiff and the defendant. Clause 23(1) lists a number of delay events from cll 23(1)(a)–(q) in which EOT may be granted. One such delay event is <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> which is in cl 23(1)(a). There are a few instances in cl 23(1) that can easily come within <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> but these are stipulated as delay events under other specific sub-clauses. I shall list out the following instances. Clause 23(1)(b) allows an EOT if there are “exceptionally adverse weather conditions”. Clause 23(1)(c) allows an EOT if there is a “fire, storm, lightning, high winds, earthquake or aircraft or aerial objects …”. Clause 23(1)(d) allows an EOT if there is a “war, hostilities, insurgency, terrorism, civil commotion, or riots”. Hence, cl 23(1)(b)–(d) are instances of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>, but under the SIA Conditions they are deliberately separated from cl 23(1)(a), the <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>clause. This suggests that the scope of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> in cl 23(1)(a) has a wider and more general application extending beyond these common instances of <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>. Furthermore, if cll 23(1)(a)–(q) are considered closely the common thread underlying all the delay events set out therein is that when the delaying events are not attributable to the contractor, it can apply for an EOT. This is a fair and equitable approach to the issue of EOT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Having found cl 23(1)(a) operative and enforceable, I turn now to ascertain whether the OG Box requirement cum installation and the delay in SPPG’s power connection works is a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event falling within the ambit of cl 23(1)(a). It is useful to set out the relevant facts, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) CCA made the request to SPPG for SPPG to lay the cable to the electrical meter compartments between 8 October 2012 (when the plaintiff informed that the electrical meter compartments were ready) and 22 October 2012 (when CCA informed that it had made the relevant arrangements with SPPG).

Instead, the true question is whether the event was such that it rendered performance of the contract “radically different” from what was originally undertaken. In my view, it was. SPPG had initially estimated that it would take about four to six weeks to complete its power connection works.

</div> In other words, SPPG had not been expected to take up the entirety of the six months buffer period. To put the extent of delay into perspective, the Project had been expected to take less than two years to complete (from the time of the signing of the LOA on 13 May 2011 to the original completion date of 21 February 2013). Thus, the four to five months taken by SPPG would constitute almost a quarter of the original estimated time required to complete the Project. Therefore, although some delays were expected from SPPG, the <span class="font-italic">extent </span>of the delay in this case was so protracted that it rendered the performance of the Contract radically different from what had initially been undertaken. The same can be said for the last-minute introduction of the OG Box requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 For the above reasons, in the context of cl 23(1) and the facts of this case, the OG Box requirement and the prolonged delay by SPPG amount to <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span> under cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions. In this case, it cannot be gainsaid that the OG Box requirement and the protracted delay by SPPG for the incoming power supply were beyond the control of the parties and this could not be attributable to the plaintiff. The delaying event in this case could easily justify the grant of an EOT to the plaintiff according to the spirit and intent of cl 23(1), provided that there was no lapse of due diligence on the part of the plaintiff. This explains why the defendant and his Assistants, especially Mr Cheung, did not object at the relevant time when the third party was considering the plaintiff’s applications for EOT 2 and EOT 3. The defendant and Mr Cheung also did not register their objections in any way when the third party granted EOT 2 and EOT 3. The defendant only took objection to the third party’s grant of EOT 2 and EOT 3 when the plaintiff instituted this Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 For these reasons, I find that cl 23(1)(a) is operative and SPPG’s OG Box requirement and delay in carrying out power connection works amounted to a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event falling within the ambit of cl 23(1)(a), and also led to a delay in completion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Clause 23(1)(o)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 I turn now to cl 23(1)(o).

</div> More importantly, there is no “variation” to speak of in this case. Given that the OG Box fell within SPPG’s purview, the plaintiff was not contractually obligated to construct the OG Box and it was instead constructed by SPPG. Thus, the OG Box requirement could not have amounted to a “variation” of the plaintiff’s contractual Works within the meaning of cl 7(1) of the SIA Conditions. There is also no evidence of any architect’s instructions, or verbal instructions even, for the plaintiff to carry out variation works as a result of SPPG’s delays.

</div> I do not accept this. There is nothing in the Contract to support such a broad interpretation of the word “variation”.

Therefore, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff should<span class="font-italic"> </span>have completed construction of the electrical meter compartments by 9 July 2012. Its failure to do so meant that, notwithstanding SPPG’s delay in achieving incoming power supply and subsequent electrical turn-on, the plaintiff itself had failed to exercise due diligence. The defendant also contends that the Project was not ready for SPPG to commence its cable-laying works until 10 January 2013, due to certain ongoing works which would have obstructed the cable-laying works.

But in the process of pulling the cable, actually the door is a hindrance. But of course, I mean, I’m not in the process of inspecting the chamber together with SPPG, so I think electrical is the best guy to tell us whether the door should be there or not there.

</div> Indeed, if the defendant genuinely believed that the Master Programme stipulated strict contractual deadlines for each activity, then the onus would be on him and his Assistants to voice their disapproval during the course of the Project if the timelines for the various activities failed to comply with the Master Programme. His Assistants, particularly Mr Cheung, who has vast experience in the construction industry, knew that the plaintiff could not be held strictly to the Master Programme. By choosing to remain silent at the relevant times and site meetings, I can only surmise that the defendant understood that the Master Programme was not a rigid schedule of activities. The defendant’s counsel accepts that the Master Programme is merely a benchmark for judging the progress of the works and the dates provided for in the Master Programme are not peremptory, because the plaintiff is ultimately held to the completion date.

</div> In the circumstances, the defendant cannot argue that the plaintiff was in delay merely by the fact that it failed to have the electrical meter compartments, including the doors, ready on 9 July 2012 for SPPG to do the incoming power supply connection.

</div> Although the CA observed at [39] that due diligence “can only be determined by pacing the progress of [the subcontractor’s] work against the subcontract programme”, this must be seen in the context of the CA’s entire decision. In particular, the CA observed at [44] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the progress of the subcontract works <span class="font-italic">consistently</span> lagged behind and did not keep pace with the subcontract programme, then the respondents were not proceeding with reasonable diligence. <span class="font-italic">This is not saying that the dates in the subcontract programme were peremptory</span>. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The CA, therefore, was not saying that the subcontractor had to follow strictly the dates set out in the subcontract programme. Rather, the CA was focused on whether the progress of the subcontract works evinced a <span class="font-italic">consistent </span>lag compared to the subcontract programme. This is evident from how the CA at [51] subsequently cited a passage which referred to a situation “where a contractor <span class="font-italic">persists</span> in a rate of progress bearing no relation either to a contractually promised or reasonable date of completion” [emphasis added]. This is also evident from the CA’s actual decision, where it held that there were “extensive delays” in respect of at least six categories of works (see <span class="font-italic">Jurong Engineering </span>at [47], [49] and [50]). Furthermore, it is not apparent whether the subcontract in <span class="font-italic">Jurong Engineering </span>contained a clause similar to cl 4(2) of the SIA Conditions, which deliberately downplays the importance of the Master Programme. As such, <span class="font-italic">Jurong Engineering </span>merely reinforces the position that adherence to the Master Programme is of <span class="font-italic">evidential </span>value in assessing whether the contractor was proceeding with due diligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Thus, the critical question is whether the rate at which the plaintiff was proceeding was in accordance with his obligation to act with due diligence.

</div> Thus, the third party had incorrectly granted the EOT in so far as it was wrong in its computation of the number of days of extension to which the plaintiff had been entitled. In coming to his findings, Mr Foo relied on the Master Programme, performing a delay analysis progressively upon the achievement of certain milestones in the Project. Based on this, he concluded that the Project’s expected completion date was 4 June 2013, which was in delay of 103 days from the original contractual completion date of 21 February 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Although I agree with Mr Foo’s methodology in his analysis, I am unable to agree with his assumptions, which have a material outcome on his findings.

As regards the latest possible date, the minutes of Site Meeting No 35 show that the application to SPPG was made by 22 October 2012, which would still have been ahead of the date Mr Foo used (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 17 November 2012). In fact, the difference between 22 October 2012 and 17 November 2012 is 26 days and that would have been omitted from the delay calculation. Secondly, Mr Foo also noted in his calculations that SPPG was unable to commence its power connection works on 17 December 2012, because: (a) the doors to the electrical meter compartment were only installed “on or around 1 December 2012”;

</div> and (b) the location of the OG box was only confirmed on 17 December 2012. This assumption of 17 December 2012 is again incorrect as both of the premises upon which it is founded are misguided for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Foo’s opinion that SPPG would commence its works only after the electrical meter compartment doors were ready was based on the evidence of Mr Lee. However, as shown above at [220]–[228], that was never a requirement mandated by SPPG. Mr Lee accepted that incoming power could be installed without the electrical meter compartment doors. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, the confirmation of the location of the OG Box was also not a requirement originally mandated by SPPG. The only requirements, as stated above at [222], were for the switchboard/meter board and cable entry pipe to be ready. Hence, the plaintiff cannot be faulted for not determining the location of an OG Box. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not responsible for determining the location of the OG Box as this was a matter to be resolved between CCA, Web, NParks, the defendant and the third party. Thus, it follows that the plaintiff cannot be said to have lacked due diligence in respect of determining the location of the OG Box. For the purposes of considering whether the plaintiff was the cause of the delay or contributed to the delay, therefore, it should be assumed that SPPG could have commenced work without the need to confirm the location of an OG Box. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 SPPG thus could have commenced its work way ahead of 17 December 2012, bringing into question Mr Foo’s calculations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Thirdly, Mr Foo opined that the site was not ready for SPPG to lay the subterranean cable as there were ongoing excavation works as of 2 January 2013. In his view, this presented site constraints, preventing SPPG from commencing work any earlier than 2 January 2013.

Accordingly, short of completing all the necessary installation works, there was nothing further for the plaintiff to do to mitigate SPPG’s delay. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the plaintiff also followed up with SPPG, in conjunction with the efforts of CCA, to persuade SPPG to carry out its power connection works more expediently.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 According to the defendant, the portion of cl 23(3) italicised above means that the third party was not entitled to grant an EOT until the delay event had “ceased to operate”. The number of days given for extension should then be calibrated against the actual number of days of delay. Further, extensions of time can only be granted if there is an impact on completion. Thus, the defendant argues that the grant of EOT 2 was premature, given that the delay event had not yet ceased at the time of the grant.

</div> At the time when EOT 2 was granted the third party could not have known whether the delay event would have any impact on eventual completion. Furthermore, the plaintiff actually completed the T&amp;C of M&amp;E works in ten days. Hence, the 40 days’ extension granted under EOT 2 unfairly benefitted the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 I do not accept this argument. Clause 23(3) of the SIA Conditions places an obligation on the third party to determine the plaintiff’s application for an EOT and to notify the plaintiff of its decision. This clause states that when the third party considers the plaintiff’s EOT application, it can wait till after the cessation of the delay event to decide the length of extension beyond the contract completion date, provided that the third party notifies the plaintiff of its decision and estimate by the time of the issuance of the final certificate. This merely provides the latest date by which the third party must notify the plaintiff of its decision. Clause 23(3) does not state that the third party cannot grant the EOT earlier if it is able to evaluate the EOT application before the cessation of the delay event. This interpretation of cl 23(3) is supported by the following observations in Eugenie Lip &amp; Choy Chee Yean, <span class="font-italic">Contract Administration Guide to the SIA Conditions of Building Contract </span>(Lexis Nexis, 2nd Ed, 2009) at para 2.131:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he approach of <span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 23.(2)</span> … recognises the need for the Contractor to have an expeditious decision on whether an extension of time would be granted. As most if not all of the benefits of an expeditious decision on whether an extension of time would be granted would be lost if the Contractor is not also given an expeditious decision on the number of days of extension of time that would be granted, it does not seem logical to oblige the Architect to give a decision on the Contractor’s entitlement to an extension of time within one month but allow the Architect the luxury of months or even years to decide on the actual number of days of extension.

The third party knew that the delay event was SPPG’s delay in carrying out power connection works and that the delay would impact the contract completion date. Instead of delaying its decision on the EOT application till the issuance of the final certificate, the third party processed the EOT application with inputs from CCA as it was certain that the delay caused by SPPG would push back the actual completion date beyond the contractual completion date of 21 February 2013.

EOT 3 was granted by the third party due to SPPG’s protracted delay in carrying out its incoming cable-laying works. This was anticipated even at the time of the granting of EOT 2, when the third party stated that it was granting an extension of 40 days and keeping another 15 days in reserve depending on whether there was “further delay due to [SPPG’s] part”. Since SPPG took longer than the parties expected, the third party granted EOT 3, again on the basis of SPPG’s delay.

So once – when they are so thorough and they pick out all the defects that they feel that they should fail the test, our works contractor should pick it up and make sure that it doesn’t reoccur in other units.

CCA had recommended 28 March 2013 as it was the first re-test and electrical turn-on date conducted for the three units, specifically Unit 12B. Further, CCA was of the opinion that the test dates for Units 12 and 12A, on 2 April 2013 and 8 April 2013 respectively, were not appropriate as the testing defects were similar to that of Unit 12B but had been left unrectified by the plaintiff.

</div> Further, from the viewpoint of the third party, the 15 days in EOT 3 related to the same issues as in EOT 2, and was distinct from this issue of re-test and electrical turn-on. This is elaborated on below at [290]–[292]. In any case, as stated above at [257], the court will not lightly disturb the third party’s assessment so long as it is one that is made fairly and rationally. The mere fact that the third party decided to have EOT 3 start on 2 April 2013 instead of 28 March 2013 does not suggest that the assessment was made unfairly or irrationally. It should also be emphasised that the plaintiff had requested 40 days’ EOT in EOT 3, but the third party decided to only grant 15 days based on its independent assessment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 In the circumstances, for both EOT 2 and EOT 3, I find that there was no failure on the part of the plaintiff to exercise due diligence or take reasonable mitigation steps.

</div> There is nothing insidious about such a request. In certifying EOT claims, the role of the third party is to evaluate the merits of the EOT application rationally and fairly. It has to exercise its independent and professional judgment and not take sides with either the plaintiff or the defendant. It is, thus, necessary for all relevant information to be placed before the third party so that it can properly exercise its judgment.

But our argument to CCA is that actually we are not looking at this at all; we are actually looking at the first 15 days that was written in the first grant, because there is in fact a delay from whichever February date that SPPG has agreed and subsequently only came at end of February. So that 15 days was there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 Accordingly, the circumstances surrounding the issuance of EOT 2 and EOT 3 do not support the inference of any conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party to grant EOT 2 and EOT 3. Neither is there any evidence that the plaintiff and the third party had an intention to injure the defendant by allowing EOT 2 and EOT 3 to be granted. There is also absolutely no evidence of interference or pressure being exerted by the plaintiff on the third party or CCA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 What is most revealing and pertinent is that these allegations to injure or defraud the defendant were never raised or suggested by the defendant and his Assistants when the EOTs were considered. If these allegations were indeed true, one would have expected the defendant and his Assistants to have protested or expressed some dissatisfaction over the granting of EOT 2 and EOT 3. However, there were no signs or any indications of unhappiness over the granting of EOT 2 and EOT 3 until the plaintiff commenced this Suit. Neither the defendant nor his Assistants raised any discernible objection to the EOTs at the material time, even though they were copied in the letters and had the opportunity to do so.

But I feel very funny how come the contractor failed the safety test, and CSYA later on back him up by saying this is common.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 Hence, I find that the defendant’s allegations of conspiracy in relation to the EOTs are completely spurious as the allegations are unsupported by any evidence. To the contrary, the evidence clearly shows that the plaintiff and the professionals involved in the processing of EOT 2 and EOT 3 acted professionally and independently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary on the EOTs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 In summary, the defendant has not proven his case on a balance of probabilities in relation to a conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party regarding the grant of the EOTs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The circumstances surrounding the evaluation of EOT 1, if anything, evidenced the third party’s professionalism and independence when assessing the EOT requests, for it was the third party who had continually pushed back and required substantiation from the plaintiff when evaluating EOT 1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) EOT 2 was granted fairly and independently as SPPG’s delay in carrying out power connection works constituted a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event falling within cl 23(1)(a) of the SIA Conditions. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not responsible for any delay that occurred and in fact, took reasonable efforts to mitigate any delays that arose. Although EOT 2 was granted for a period of 40 days, instead of CCA’s recommendation of 15 days, I find that the third party acted rationally and its decision was based on a breakdown of the Works that the plaintiff was required to undertake. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In EOT 3, the third party granted the plaintiff a period of 15 days of EOT. This was also justifiably granted as it was similarly due to SPPG’s delay in carrying out power connection works, which constituted a <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>event. EOT 3 was linked to EOT 2 in so far as the third party, in granting 40 days for EOT 2, had indicated to the plaintiff that it was keeping another 15 days in reserve depending on whether there was “further delay due to [SPPG’s] part”. SPPG did cause further delay after EOT 2. Moreover, the plaintiff acted with due diligence in seeking to comply with the First Testing and Inspection. The third party’s decision was, therefore, made professionally and independently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 My findings above are also buttressed by the fact that there was no shred of evidence of any broader conspiracy surrounding the EOTs. The allegations of fraud raised by the defendant in this regard were often fundamentally inconsistent or soundly rebutted by the evidence available. I, therefore, reject the defendant’s allegations in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Completion certificate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 The defendant asserts that the CC was issued prematurely and without basis. The defendant avers that the conditions in Item 72 of the Preliminaries regarding the issuance of the CC were not satisfied. On that basis, the defendant alleges that the circumstances give rise to an inference that there was a conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party for the third party to issue the CC to the plaintiff with the intention of thereby causing injury to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 To recapitulate, Item 72 of the Preliminaries comprises three conditions as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Conditions of Contract, a Completion Certificate will not be issued until:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) All parts of the Works are in the Architect’s opinion ready for occupation and for use.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) All services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily as specified in the Contract or the relevant Sub-Contract including handing over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) All works included in the Contract are performed including such rectification as may be required to bring the work to the completion and standards acceptable to the Architect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 In determining whether the CC can be issued, Item 72 of the Preliminaries must be read together with cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions which provides:

Therefore, I find that although the formal contract documents were not signed by the defendant, the plaintiff and the defendant agreed by their conduct that the formal contract documents formed part of the Contract. As such, Item 72 of the Preliminaries, which can be found in Volume 1B of the formal contract documents, is also part of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The plaintiff’s submission that Item 72 relates to the issuance of the MC and not the CC</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 The plaintiff takes a slightly different position from the third party.

</div> The last point is especially significant as it was F+G and CCA who had prepared the formal contract documents, including the Preliminaries. Therefore, the witnesses from F+G and/or CCA could have provided useful evidence as to how the Preliminaries came about and whether they were originally drafted for the PSS Conditions. However, the plaintiff failed to raise this point entirely.

</div> In contrast, the SIA Conditions use the exact term “Completion Certificate”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 Thirdly, even if the Preliminaries were originally drafted to be used with the PSS Conditions, that does not mean that they cannot be used with the SIA Conditions. Furthermore, when used with the SIA Conditions, the Preliminaries may not necessarily take on the same meanings as when they were used with the PSS Conditions. While there may be some discrepancies in the terminologies used (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Item 60 of the Preliminaries refers to a “Certificate of Substantial Completion” although the SIA Conditions do not refer to a “Certificate of Substantial Completion”), the meaning as intended by the parties is ultimately a matter of construction based on the circumstances as a whole. In construing the meaning of “Completion Certificate”, it is pertinent that Item 72 of the Preliminaries clearly states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and <span class="font-italic">Conditions of Contract</span>, a Completion Certificate will not be issued until … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 In turn, the phrase “Conditions of Contract” is expressly defined at Item 3 of the Preliminaries to be the SIA Conditions together with the Supplementary Conditions. Read in this context, the phrase “Completion Certificate” in Item 72 must have the same meaning as the phrase “Completion Certificate” in cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions although the scope and requirements in the two provisions are ostensibly different. It is also important to note that none of the witnesses, including those from F+G and CCA, testified that Item 72 of the Preliminaries was applicable to the Maintenance Certificate rather than the Completion Certificate. If Item 72 indeed relates to the Maintenance Certificate, one would expect the witnesses and the parties to raise it right from the start. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 For the above reasons, I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that the term “Completion Certificate” in Item 72 of the Preliminaries should be construed as “Maintenance Certificate”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The plaintiff’s and the third party’s submission that Item 72 should be disregarded as it contradicts cl 24(4)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 Finally, the plaintiff and the third party both submit that even if Item 72 forms part of the Contract, cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions supersedes Item 72 of the Preliminaries, such that the latter should be <span class="font-italic">disregarded</span> when determining whether the CC can be issued.

Otherwise, the phrase “Architect’s opinion” would be rendered otiose.

In these circumstances, it would be justifiable for the third party to issue the CC notwithstanding that the TOP has not been obtained.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to achieve levelled steps and equal risers, and considering the small deviation from the requirements, the timber planks could simply be sanded down until the correct height for each step and riser was achieved. Such sanding down work is minor work which we were of the view could be easily done. This was precisely the method which GTMS undertook to rectify the riser issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 However, it does not matter whether or not the unequal steps and risers are “minor” works by industry standard or that they could easily be rectified. The fact is that the Project could not have been “ready for occupation” under Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries in the light of the safety issues presented by the unequal steps and risers. Thus, these minor works would have posed a danger to the occupiers of the Project. That was why the TOP was not granted after TOP Inspection 1. As stated by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Court of Appeal) </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]–[55]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 … Staircases are potentially dangerous structures because tripping and falling on staircases can have very dire consequences including serious physical injury or even death. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … Persons involved in the building and construction industry are aware of a known human behavioural trait. Most people only look at a staircase when they negotiate the first few steps. Thereafter their gaze goes elsewhere because they assume the steps are equal in rise or drop. Any non-uniform change in the rise or drop could potentially result in that person tripping or losing his balance and falling. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 When the Architect issued the Completion Certificate, he already knew from the TOP inspection that there was an important defect in unlevelled steps and unequal risers in all staircases. As noted above, the Architect acknowledged the existence of these defects in his attachment to the Completion Certificate as requiring rectification … These staircases were thus clearly not safe for use by occupants of the Buildings when the Architect issued his Completion Certificate. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 The third party claims that it acted in good faith based on its experience, commercial understanding and practical reality. But none of these reasons can override the clear and express language of Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries. Further, Mr Yong testified that when he issued the CC on 15 May 2013, he was unaware of Item 72 of the Preliminaries. Instead, he relied on cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions.

</div> As stated above at [300], however, cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions expressly states that the Works must “comply with the Contract in all respects”. Therefore, this provision requires the third party to refer to the Contract documents between the plaintiff and the defendant, which includes Item 72 of the Preliminaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 It is, therefore, clear that as of TOP Inspection 1 on 30 April 2013, Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries had not been fully complied with by the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff itself admits that “there [were] construction errors in the steps that caused [TOP Inspection 1] to fail”.

</div> TOP Inspection 1 was before 15 May 2013, when the CC was issued to take effect from 17 April 2013. The third party knew on 15 May 2013 that TOP Inspection 1 failed for several reasons, including the non-compliant steps and risers which was a construction matter within the plaintiff’s scope of responsibility. In fact, the evidence shows that the third party knew that the steps and risers were non-compliant even before the application for TOP Inspection 1. Hence, the third party should not have issued the CC on 15 May 2013 certifying that the Project was completed on 17 April 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 TOP Inspection 2 was on 18 June 2013. After TOP Inspection 2, the BCA did not comment on the steps and risers inside the three units, including those that they had earlier identified as non-compliant. Thus, those steps and risers were deemed acceptable by the BCA. However, the Project again failed TOP Inspection 2. This second failure to obtain the TOP was due to three issues – the steps at the RC flat roof for all units, the last step at the landscape area of Unit 12A that failed to comply with the requirements for steps and risers, and the height of the barrier at the pavilion in Unit 12A.

</div> The reason for not allowing the steps pertained to <span class="font-italic">design</span>, rather than as a result of a <span class="font-italic">construction fault </span>on the plaintiff’s part.

</div>
</div> Therefore, this was not a construction error by the plaintiff. I also do not consider this to be a matter of negligent design on the part of the third party. The third party had considered that the steps at the RC flat roof fell within certain exceptions to the BCA’s Approved Document – Acceptable Solutions (July 2011) (the “BCA Regulations”), whereas the BCA officer took a different view. This was a matter of a difference in opinion, rather than the third party being negligent in its design.

While this was within the contract drawings and clearly fell within the scope of the plaintiff’s Works, the cause of the defect was not a construction error. Rather, the defect arose due to the settlement of the landscaped soil, which resulted in the height of the last step being higher than permitted under the BCA Regulations.

</div> As this was a natural phenomenon, it cannot be attributed to the plaintiff or the third party, nor can it be regarded as a construction error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">332 Finally, I turn to the issue of the height of the barrier at the pavilion in Unit 12A. The TOP was only obtained on 16 September 2013 due to this issue, which eventually necessitated the installation of a glass barrier. According to the BCA Regulations, where a design had a fall of more than one metre in height, a barrier should be constructed for safety purposes. Furthermore, the BCA Regulations state that the “height of a barrier is measured vertically from the finished floor level to the top of the barrier”.

</div> In this instance, there was a wall at the pavilion of Unit 12A which was a metre high if measured from the pavilion floor. However, there was a bench built into the wall. During TOP Inspection 1, the BCA officer measured the height of the wall from the top of the bench instead of from the floor of the pavilion. Thus, the height of the wall became less than a metre and the BCA officer was of the view that this posed a safety issue as people could climb onto the bench and potentially topple over the wall onto the level below which would be more than a metre fall. The third party was of the opinion that it was not a safety issue as the wall was a metre tall when measured from the floor of the pavilion. On this view, the term “finished floor level” in the BCA Regulations referred to the floor of the pavilion, rather than the top of the bench.<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, the BCA disagreed as the BCA officer measured the height of the wall from the top of the bench to the top of the wall.

</div> The BCA Regulations did not state where the measurements should begin, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from the top of the wall or the top of the bench. It was, thus, a matter of a difference in opinion. The third party could not have foreseen this with certainty before the BCA’s inspections. In fact, prior to the construction of the Project, the third party had obtained approvals for the building plans from the BCA. The building plans included the height of the wall with the built-in bench at the pavilion at Unit 12A being stated as 1000mm from the “finished floor level”.

</div> Since the BCA had approved the building plans, the BCA should not have faulted this aspect of the design at TOP Inspection 1. Nevertheless, the BCA did. The third party then attempted to resolve the issue by implementing an invisible grille which was, however, rejected by the BCA. Eventually, a glass barrier was used with the approval of the BCA. It would, therefore, not be correct to say that the third party had been negligent in designing the pavilion and the invisible grille. It would also not be correct to say that the issue with the height of the barrier at the pavilion in Unit 12A was a construction error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">334 Thus, while the failure of TOP Inspection 1 was due to construction faults on the plaintiff’s part, the failure of TOP Inspection 2 was not. Rather, it was caused by natural phenomenon and design issues falling within the third party’s purview. Therefore, since the failure of TOP Inspection 2 was not due to defects within the plaintiff’s contractual responsibility, the third party could have issued the CC once the defects highlighted in TOP Inspection 1 were rectified. I accept Mr Yong’s evidence that such rectification works were completed by 28 May 2013, within 28 days from the date of TOP Inspection 1.

</div> The rectification works started on 17 May 2013 and it took 11 days to complete it. I note that there is some dispute amongst the parties in relation to whether the rectification works for the steps and risers had in fact been carried out satisfactorily, which I shall deal with further below. Thus, I find that Item 72(a) of the Preliminaries was satisfied by 28 May 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">335 For completeness, I should add that the plaintiff pleaded for the court to grant an extension of time from 17 April 2013 to 16 September 2013, or in the alternative, for a declaration that time had been set at large for the completion of the Contract. This was on the basis that any delay in obtaining the TOP was due to the third party’s failure to produce a design for the pavilion at Unit 12A that was acceptable to the BCA.

</div> Given my finding that the CC should have been issued on 28 May 2013 (<span class="font-italic">before</span> the issue relating to the pavilion at Unit 12A was resolved), there is no need for the court to consider the issue of any delay occasioned by the invisible grille. Furthermore, for reasons which I shall explain at [661]–[665] below, the relevant act of prevention was not the third party’s design of the invisible grille, but its instructions to the plaintiff to delay rectification of the steps and risers until after TOP Inspection 1. In the circumstances, it was understandable why the plaintiff did not apply for an EOT after the issues relating to the invisible grille arose. At that point in time, the CC had already been issued. There would have been no need for the plaintiff to apply for any EOT and it would not have occurred to the plaintiff to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries has been fulfilled</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 The defendant alleges that as at 17 April 2013, various services, including gas and electricity, had not undergone T&amp;C.

The plaintiff relied on this representation when it did not carry out the T&amp;C of the gas services until after the TOP and the issuance of the CC.

</div> In contrast, Mr Yong and Ms Chua were both more closely involved in the running of the Project than Mr Tan. In fact, Ms Chua was the M&amp;E engineer for the Project, therefore, she would have been directly involved in overseeing the plaintiff’s progress in relation to the electrical services. In these circumstances, when it comes to the issue of whether the T&amp;C of the electrical services was in fact carried out after power turn-on, I am more inclined to prefer the evidence of Mr Yong and Ms Chua over that of Mr Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 Secondly, the T&amp;C of the ACMV works had already been completed on or around 1 and 2 April 2013 (before electrical turn-on), as well as from 10 to 12 April 2013 (after electrical turn-on). This is supported by the contemporaneous documents, and confirmed by Ms Chua at trial.

</div> However, it was not apparent from the defendant’s pleadings that his case regarding Item 72(b) related to <span class="font-italic">all </span>of the services covered by Item 72(b).

</div> There is no mention of the T&amp;C for the swimming pool. The fact that the defendant specifically referred to “gas, electrical services and ACMV” reinforces the understanding that the defendant was only contesting T&amp;C in relation to these particular services. In fact, the defendant’s counsel acknowledged in his oral submissions that the defendant did not “plead the swimming pool”. The defendant’s counsel submitted that nevertheless, the court should consider the issue as it “came out in evidence”.

</div> As such, to consider the issue now would be prejudicial to the plaintiff and the third party, who did not have the opportunity to prepare for this point and adduce from their witnesses the relevant evidence to address this point.

</div> While this document was referred to by the parties in the course of the trial, it was not for the purpose of asking the witnesses whether and when the T&amp;C of the swimming pool was conducted.

But, Mr Yong, can I suggest to you that if you take that interpretation or that position, then you are ignoring what item 72(b) of the preliminaries expressly require the architect to consider. Do you agree, Mr Yong?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: As I mentioned, on 17 April – I mean, prelim 72 really did not occur to us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">369 I accept the third party’s position that the handing over of the Documents under the second part of Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. It is trite that the Singapore courts adopt a contextual approach to interpretation. This was set out by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [130]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he court will <span class="font-italic">first</span> take into account the plain language of the contract together with relevant extrinsic material which is evidence of its context. <span class="font-italic">Then, if, in the light of this context, </span>the plain language of the contract becomes ambiguous (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it takes on another plausible meaning) or absurd, the court will be entitled to put on the contractual term in question an interpretation which is different from that demanded by its plain language. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">370 The CA further cited Gerald McMeel, <span class="font-italic">The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation, Implication, and Rectification </span>(Oxford University Press, 2007) and endorsed several canons of interpretation at [131]. The ones that are significant in this case are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The aim of construction: the aim of the exercise of construction of a contract is to ascertain the meaning which it would convey to a reasonable business person. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The holistic or “whole contract” approach: the exercise of construction is based on the whole contract or a holistic approach. Courts are not excessively focused upon a particular word, phrase, sentence or clause, rather, the emphasis is on the document as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The contextual dimension: the exercise in construction is informed by the surrounding circumstances or external context. Modern judges are prepared to look beyond the four corners of a document, or the bare words of an utterance. It is permissible to have regard to the legal, regulatory, and factual matrix which constitutes the background in which the document was drafted or the utterance was made. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Business purpose: due consideration is given to the commercial purpose of the transaction or provision. The courts have regard to the overall purpose of the parties with respect to a particular transaction, or more narrowly the reason why a particular obligation was undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Avoiding unreasonable results: a construction which leads to very unreasonable results is to be avoided unless it is required by clear words and there is no other tenable construction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">371 Applying these principles, I turn first to the plain language of Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries. In full, Item 72(b) reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Conditions of Contract, a Completion Certificate will not be issued until:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b) All services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily as specified in the Contract or the relevant Sub-Contract including handing over all test certificates, operating instructions and warranties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">372 Item 72(b) essentially comprises two parts. Firstly, the requirement to ensure that all services are tested, commissioned and operating satisfactorily (the “T&amp;C requirement”). Secondly, the requirement to hand over the Documents (the “handover requirement”). The defendant contends that the court should adopt the literal meaning of Item 72(b), which is that it is mandatory for the handover requirement to be fulfilled in order for Item 72(b) to be satisfied. In my view, however, the word “including” which connects the T&amp;C requirement and the handover requirement shows that the handover requirement is a <span class="font-italic">subset </span>of the T&amp;C requirement. The plain language of Item 72(b) thus suggests that the handover requirement is <span class="font-italic">subsidiary</span> to the primary focus of the sub-clause, which is the T&amp;C requirement. In determining whether Item 72(b) has been satisfied, therefore, the critical issue is whether the T&amp;C requirement has been fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">373 This alternative meaning is plausible in the light of the context of the clause and the Contract as a whole, as well as its commercial background and business purpose. I turn first to the contractual context. Item 72(b) forms part of various other requirements that must be satisfied before the third party can issue the CC. These are Items 72(a) and 72(c), as well as cl 24(4) of the SIA Conditions. Items 72(a) and 72(c) provide that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Conditions of Contract, a Completion Certificate will not be issued until:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a) All parts of the Works are <span class="font-italic">in the Architect’s opinion</span> ready for occupation and for use.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c) All works included in the Contract are performed including such rectification as may be required to bring the work to the completion and standards <span class="font-italic">acceptable to the Architect</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">374 Clause 24(4) of the SIA Conditions provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Such certificate is referred to in this Contract as a ‘Completion Certificate’, and shall be issued by the Architect when the Works <span class="font-italic">appear to be complete and to comply with the Contract in all respects</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">375 As seen from the italicised portions of the provisions above, these provisions confer onto the third party a significant amount of leeway to apply its judgment to determine whether such conditions have been satisfied. This makes sense given that it is precisely the architect’s expertise that is sought after when an owner engages an architect to oversee a project. The T&amp;C requirement in Item 72(b) contains a phrasing similar to the above provisions in so far as it uses the word “satisfactorily”, which must refer to the satisfaction of the architect. The spirit of these provisions, therefore, is that the CC should be issued when the architect, applying his professional judgment and expertise, is satisfied that the works have been completed. Allowing the architect to retain this broad, general discretion to determine whether the T&amp;C requirements have been satisfied, rather than restricting him to the timing of the handover of the Documents, would be more in line with the spirit of Item 72.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">376 This interpretation is fortified by the commercial background and business purpose of Item 72. The literal interpretation of Item 72(b) would not cohere with the business purpose of the CC. As mentioned at [324] above, the purpose of the CC is, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to determine the plaintiff’s liability for delay and determine the commencement of the maintenance period. Therefore, in construing Item 72(b), as with Item 72(a), the court must have reference to the scope of the plaintiff’s responsibilities. As Mr Yong testified, the Documents must first be verified by the quality surveyor before they can be handed over the defendant.

</div> If Item 72(b) were construed literally such that the CC could only be issued after the handover requirement was satisfied, the plaintiff would be exposed to the risk of delay on the part of other parties over whom it had no control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">377 Similarly, to interpret Item 72(b) literally so as to require the Documents to be handed over before the issuance of the CC would have been impracticable, unworkable even, for all parties.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: Okay. Now, if, at that time, you were aware of prelim 72, would you have issued the completion certificate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: I think I would still have issued it, because prelim 72 involved a lot of paperworks [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] which I mentioned earlier that it’s impossible to get it on time if you want to take that completion date as the thing. Like warranties, all this … the supplier will only issue you the warranties when you actually issue the completion cert, so it’s a back-to-back story, you see. So same thing, I think a lot of these documents, like operational manual and then the warranties and then the working drawings, it doesn’t really affects [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the usage of the place, so we will still issue the completion. Those can be actually follow up during the maintenance period, which is that one whole year.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: … at the same time we also know that contractor has already start doing all this thing, and this, in usual practice, will always come later. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: What will always come later?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: The paperworks [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], the drawing, the OMM, the warranties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">378 Such an impracticable outcome could not have been the parties’ intentions, neither would a reasonable business person have understood Item 72(b) in this manner. Although the court must not rewrite the parties’ contract (see Goh Yihan, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts in Singapore</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 10.005), the unreasonableness of a particular interpretation may suggest that it was <span class="font-italic">not </span><span class="font-italic">the parties’ intentions</span> for such an interpretation to be adopted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 Furthermore, I note that Item 72 was included in the Contract by CCA, rather than having been specifically negotiated by the plaintiff and the defendant. Therefore, it is not the case that the parties specially took pains to include this clause in the Contract. This supports the interpretation that the handover requirement is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">380 Finally, I note that cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions states that “[t]he Architect shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract”. This is not a bar to the abovementioned purposive construction of Item 72(b). Clause 31(13) merely states that the Architect must adhere strictly to the <span class="font-italic">terms of the Contract</span>; it does not require that the Architect adhere strictly to the <span class="font-italic">literal meaning </span>of the Contract. Rather, the terms of the Contract are determined by the court through the process of construction. In other words, cl 31(13) does not mandate a literal interpretation of the Contract, only that the Architect must certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract as construed by the court. Therefore, it does not impede the purposive interpretation that the handover of the Documents in Item 72 is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">381 For the above reasons, I find that Item 72(b) is fulfilled as long as the services are tested, commissioned and operating to the third party’s satisfaction as specified in the Contract and subcontracts. In assessing whether these requirements have been satisfied, the third party may have regard to whether the Documents have been handed over to the defendant. Given that the T&amp;C had been carried out for all services except for gas services by 17 April 2013, and the third party was of the view that, from a practical perspective, the handover of the Documents could be done on another day, Item 72(b) was satisfied by 17 April 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">382 Thus, my finding remains that the CC should only have been issued as of 28 May 2013, which is the date that Item 72(a) was complied with (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of completion of rectification works in relation to the defects raised after TOP Inspection 1).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries has been fulfilled </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">383 The defendant submits that the third party should not have issued the CC certifying completion on 17 April 2013, as there were “many outstanding unrectified construction defects at the Project”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">387 I turn now to the alleged defects. The matters raised by the defendant can be classified into three categories:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) defects due to the plaintiff’s failure to exercise proper care and skill in constructing the Project (see Stephen Furst and Vivian Ramsey, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2016) at para 3-071);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) defects due to the defendant’s lack of maintenance of the Project and/or wear and tear; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) issues arising due to the natural characteristics of the materials chosen by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">388 From the outset, I must emphasise that the plaintiff and the third party can only be liable for defects that are due to the plaintiff’s failure to exercise proper care and skill (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first category stated above).

He relied on this clause to support his finding of defects in relation to the Volakas marble, the ironwood for the timber decking and the variance in tonality of the Indian rosewood. With respect, Mr Chin must read that provision in the context of the entirety of clause 11(1). It is wrong for him to focus only on that portion of the clause to the exclusion of other parts to support his opinion that the plaintiff furnished poor quality materials in this Project.

Firstly, the gas pipe sleeve had been dented. Secondly, the gas pipe had been punctured. Lastly, there had been no proper replacement and pressure testing of the gas pipe.

These introductions of fresh evidence were also done after the summary judgment application in 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">397 I shall elaborate on each of these fresh applications in greater detail to illustrate the undesirable state of affairs in relation to the defendant’s conduct of this case. Generally, the court should not condone such unsatisfactory conduct on the part of the defendant, as the belated introduction of fresh evidence may impinge on procedural fairness if the opposing parties are not given sufficient opportunity to respond to the fresh evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">398 The first application to introduce fresh evidence was made on 28 November 2018. The defendant sought to adduce into evidence a video taken on 22 November 2018. The defendant had engaged a contractor to hack the driveway of Unit 12A to expose the allegedly punctured gas pipe. According to the defendant’s counsel, Mr Christopher Chong, the purpose of the video was to prove that the plaintiff did not perform the necessary rectification works on the gas pipe sleeve and that the gas pipe still remained punctured.

Again, it must be emphasised that this introduction of new evidence was made two weeks <span class="font-italic">after</span> the <span class="font-italic">third</span> tranche of trial had commenced.

The burden is on the defendant to prove his counterclaim that the gas pipe was punctured and that the plaintiff did not rectify the defect.

</div> Mr Lim SL suspected that the gas pipes might be waterlogged, preventing gas from flowing through. Accordingly, Mr Lim SL conducted investigations on the same gas pipe that the defendant now alleges was punctured. For the purpose of these investigations, Mr Lim SL hacked the tiles of the driveway at Unit 12A that covered the gas pipe, removed the cement, cut the iron gas pipe sleeve and removed the sleeve.

</div> It was in the course of this process that the gas pipe sleeve was deliberately cut to access the gas pipe. Separately, Mr Lim SL also had to drill and tap a hole in the gas pipe to check if it was waterlogged. He found nothing wrong with the gas pipe and patched up the hole that he had drilled with a steel plug and sealant to prevent any gas leaks.

It was subsequently revealed that the cause of the low gas pressure was due to gas pipes laid by external parties at the roadside outside the Project.

</div> Mr Bernard Lim is a project coordinator at City Gas Pte Ltd, which is a retail supplier of gas. He said that the laying of the gas pipe was according to the as-built plan, which had been approved. He further said that the gas pipe protected by the iron sleeve that was laid across the driveway of Unit 12A is proper and acceptable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">411 Mr Bernard Lim had inspected the relevant gas pipe at Unit 12A and opined that sealing the hole in the gas pipe with a steel plug was contrary to accepted practice. However, the defendant’s pleadings are not that the rectification work done to the gas pipe is improper or illegal. Rather, the pleadings state that <span class="font-italic">no rectification work</span> was carried out on the dented or punctured gas pipe. It is, therefore, clear that Mr Bernard Lim’s evidence is simply irrelevant to any of the pleaded issues as stated at [393]-–[395]. Thus, Mr Bernard Lim’s evidence should not, strictly speaking, have been admitted at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">412 However, I am cognisant of the fact that his evidence related to the issue of gas safety. Thus, I shall nevertheless deal with this matter. In Mr Bernard Lim’s opinion, it was a dangerous practice to drill a hole into the gas pipe and to subsequently seal the hole with a steel plug. This was because there was a possibility of gas leakage as the gas pipe in Unit 12A was made of polythylene.

In this instance, the video evidence was, for all intents and purposes, a fishing expedition for evidence to support the defendant’s case that there was a punctured gas pipe.

Mr Chin’s evidence is also highly unreliable, for as stated above at [131]–[133], he vacillated on a number of key issues when providing evidence. In particular, the Volakas marble was a key issue in relation to which he originally testified that a complete replacement of all the marble slabs would be required. However, he subsequently retracted from his original position, conceding that it was possible to attempt to rectify the defects using other means besides a complete replacement. This change of approach suggests that he may have realised the extreme position that he initially took. In any case, I find Mr Chin’s evidence in relation to the Volakas marble to have been given without the requisite experience and it should be treated with extreme caution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">420 It should also be noted that RTO Leong testified that he had specifically checked the marble that was delivered to the site at multiple times:

In a letter that was sent in March 2014, Mr Yiannis Chatziioannidis, the managing director of Marble Market, stated that Volakas marble “can include some natural impurities like red and yellow lines, grey crystals … hairline cracks and fissures … pinholes and holes … [and] brown pencil veins”.

At that meeting, Mr Yong explained to them the issues relating to Volakas marble, including the tonality, stain, grain and veins, which was often only appreciated by marble connoisseurs. In fact, at this meeting the defendant’s wife had expressed her objections to the selection of Volakas marble, which she thought to be ugly. Ironically, it was shortly after this meeting that the defendant chose Volakas marble for the Project, to the surprise of Mr Yong.

However, with regard to the Volakas marble flooring, the defendant would have been aware of the alleged defects since January 2013. The fact that he did not have any issues then and only complained about the alleged defects in October 2013 is evidence of how the defendant only sought to subsequently nit-pick and identify all possible defects in an unreasonable and pedantic manner, in order to find fault with the plaintiff and the third party once the certified payment claims became due.

In fact, from the time the Project was purportedly completed in April 2013 to his investigations in November 2014, which resulted in the mapping, the timber had been left exposed for a period of 19 months. That would have allowed the split and checks to develop, as per Mr Tong’s opinion above at [438] unless there was proper maintenance. Further, Mr Tong’s evidence is consistent with the literature that states that ironwood, which was used for the timber decking, “seasons slowly with tendency for … splitting”.

You cannot just take out the aluminium work and send it to factory, because that's not possible once the aluminium is assembled. So there is a certain procedure for the paint works to be sprayed on, so that's –– there's an approved method of statement for this, so we accepted that, because the paint supplier are the ones who gave us the statement and they are the ones who give the warranty.

</div> In this regard, the defendant relies on the measurements of the risers by Mr Chin. He utilised precision measurement tools such as the digital Vernier caliper and a bubble leveller to carry out an interpolation and extrapolation of different points of the various steps. Undoubtedly, this allowed him to achieve a highly precise reading of the thickness and height of the various steps and risers. Based on his findings, Mr Chin opined that the riser heights were non-compliant with the BCA Regulations. Further, he opined that the difference in thickness and height of the various steps and risers was evidence of inadequate rectification done by the plaintiff. Overall, in Mr Chin’s view, these defects presented a hazard to anyone walking up or down the stairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">458 However, Mr Chin’s use of such equipment to measure the height of the risers is completely inappropriate and unreasonable in the construction industry.

</div> Mr Chin’s method of measurement is also at odds with the construction industry’s traditional method of measuring steps and risers, namely, the use of a simple measuring tape. In the construction industry, precision instruments are not used to measure the height of the risers. Mr Chin conceded that the digital Vernier caliper is not used in the construction industry to measure steps and risers and that the usual method of measurement was by a measuring tape. He conceded this several times in court:

The digital Vernier caliper is a tool used in the precision manufacturing industry in which exact precision in measurement is critical as there is little or no room for error. This is not the case for the measurement of the steps and risers as the BCA does give a range for acceptance of compliance. Mr Chin conceded that prior to this Project he had no experience in measuring steps and risers. For him to use the digital Vernier caliper, knowing that such precision equipment is not used in construction industry, suggests that he was out to prove that the steps and risers were not compliant with the BCA Regulations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">461 In my view, using the common measuring tape would have been the appropriate method of measurement, given that the BCA itself had used this method to determine if the steps and risers were compliant with statutory requirements.

</div> In fact, according to Mr Yong who was present at the TOP inspections, he said that the BCA inspectors walked along the stairs and if they felt that the steps and risers were uneven or not according to the prescribed requirements, then measurements were taken. The BCA inspectors did not take measurements of every step and riser.

</div> The BCA’s method of measurement must be the starting premise to determine if the steps and risers were in compliance with statutory requirements. Indeed, when the third party corresponded with the BCA to rectify the non-compliances arising out of the TOP inspections, the photographs of the rectified stairs were accompanied by a tape measure.

</div> While this is true, this is a mere irregularity and is not fatal to the plaintiff’s admission of such evidence.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">468 Secondly, the defendant also relies on <span class="font-italic">Bumi Geo Engineering Pte Ltd v Civil Tech Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1322 (“<span class="font-italic">Bumi Geo</span>”) to submit that the measurements were a “once-off set of measurements”, were not recorded with a disinterested motive, and it was unclear who took the measurements and whether it was taken by the person who recorded them.

</div>
</div> These objections are without merit. The fact that the measurements were “once-off” is immaterial. The critical question, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Bumi Geo </span>at [105], is whether the measurements were made “in the way of business”, which “has been defined to mean a course of transactions performed in one’s habitual relations with others and as a material part of one’s mode of obtaining a livelihood”. In the present case, it is clear that they were – Mr Ocampo made the measurements in the course of his employment with the plaintiff for the purposes of the plaintiff’s business as a contractor. Furthermore, the court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Bumi Geo </span>at [104] regarding a “disinterested motive” were in relation to explaining the <span class="font-italic">rationale </span>of the hearsay exception, rather than laying down a general rule that all evidence sought to be adduced via s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iv) had to have been made with a disinterested motive. The identity of the person who took the measurements is also not unclear, as there is evidence before the court that they were taken by Mr Ocampo. Thus, I reject the defendant’s submission that the measurements of the rectified steps and risers taken by Mr Ocampo are inadmissible hearsay evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">469 The defendant still asserts up till today that the defects relating to the steps and risers are unrectified. I note that the TOP has been granted for the Project and the BCA certified the staircases as having passed their inspections, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the staircase is safe for use.

The findings in the BAPL Steps Report also demonstrate that it is extremely difficult to rectify the problems to bring the steps within (1) contractual compliance; and (2) statutory compliance because the amount of play is restricted by the steel structure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A major problem with the steps and risers is that many of the risers exceed the regulated 175mm height. Evidently, many of the timber treads were shaved at the edge in an attempt to bring the riser within the 175mm statutory requirement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The restriction in rectifying the timber treads that are too thin, i.e. below 10mm thickness, is that this will add to the height of the riser above. At the same time, there are many other timber treads that are too thick, i.e. more than 20mm. While I note that Mr Chin Cheong’s recommendation is to sand down the timber treads that are too thick, this will create a new problem of increasing the height of the adjacent riser.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A third complication lies in the requirement that two consecutive steps must not have a variance in height of more than 5mm. Given the disparity in the readings, it is not possible for a simple replacement of timber treads that are too thin and sanding down of timber treads that are too thick (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Proposed Rectification Method</span>”). The Proposed Rectification Method, while logical when viewed in isolation, is unable to bring all the steps in compliance with statutory requirements, let alone contractual requirements.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Due to the size of the flights, it is almost impossible to remove the stair to the fabrication shop to rectify the steelwork, which would require certain part of the walls and doors to be dismantled for removal and installation.

</div> However, as Mr Yong noted, this would not be a problem if one sanded down the various flights of steps as a whole. In that way, there would be a greater range of steps to allow for any topping up or sanding down to be done. Although he had not been required to carry out the exercise, in his view, this would have rectified the defects:

In all these inspections, he had no problem when he used the staircases in the three units to access the upper floors. There was never any mention in his reports, prior to his inspection of the steps and risers, of any hazard posed by the steps and risers, or that he had tripped or fallen because of the unevenness or uneven height in the steps and risers.

</div> As a corollary, the possibility that the leakages, if any, observed by Mr Ng DY in 2018 were due to a lack of maintenance and wear and tear, as suggested by Mr Tan, could not be eliminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">490 Secondly, Mr Ng DY’s evidence was unreliable. He had only conducted a physical inspection involving hacking work at Unit 12A and not the other two units. Unit 12A was selected on the instructions of the defendant. Further, Mr Ng DY did not decide which tiles to hack. It was the defendant who discussed with Mr Ng DY’s engineer on the tiles to be hacked.

</div> In fact, he had only conducted a visual inspection of these two units. Mr Ng DY assumed that a finding of leakage in one swimming pool could similarly mean that there were leakages in the other pools, simply because the three swimming pools were constructed in the <span class="font-italic">same manner.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">491 This is not how an expert should conduct his checks. Assuming his method was correct, the proper way to find out if the other two swimming pools were leaking would be to conduct an independent and objective physical test involving hacking works, which he had not done. Such failure to do so made his report unreliable. In addition, this was the first time that Mr Ng DY had ever been asked to inspect a swimming pool for leakages and to prepare such a corresponding report.

To ascertain this issue of swimming pool leak, it is necessary to first describe the structure of the swimming pool wall, which comprised several layers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">493 The outermost layer was made up of tiles, either granite tiles making up the exterior wall of the swimming pool, or mosaic tiles on the interior wall of the swimming pool. Underneath the layer of tiles was a layer of cement adhesive, which was used to adhere the tiles to the third layer of cement bedding. The fourth layer was the cementitious waterproof membrane, referred to as a cementitious polymer modified elastrometric membrane.

</div> However, this methodology may not be correct.  For a swimming pool to leak and result in substantial water loss, this would entail the water having to seep through several layers. First, the mosaic tiles and grouting must be defective. Second, there is a defective waterproof membrane of the interior wall that holds the water. Third, the water has to seep through the thick reinforced concrete wall with waterproof additive. Lastly, the water has to go through the defective <span class="font-italic">exterior </span>waterproof membrane, cement bedding and adhesive cement that held the granite tiles for the cascading effects. This clearly had not happened as Mr Ng DY acknowledged in cross-examination:

Although Mr Ng DY acknowledged this to be the case, he did not examine the inner wall of the swimming pool which would determine whether the swimming pool was leaking, as he acknowledged in court:

</div> The cementitious waterproof membrane looks similar to the cement concrete wall and Mr Ng DY noted that his workers would not be able to differentiate between these two materials. Thus, it was possible that the workers could have damaged or removed the waterproof membrane themselves during the hacking process. In fact, this possibility was also corroborated by the testimony of RTO Leong in court. When referred to Mr Ng DY’s AEIC and the relevant pictures, RTO Leong initially testified in cross-examination as follows:

Further, given the speculative nature of his evidence and his lack of experience on the matter, I reject Mr Chin’s evidence that the swimming pools had water leakage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">Lee Tiong Meng’s evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">525 I turn now to Mr Lee’s evidence that there was a marginal drop in the swimming pool water levels due to evaporation and possible seepage from the screed of the coping edge. Mr Lee explained that the coping edge of a swimming pool is the cap or edging which is the granite that is placed around the top rim of a swimming pool. The screed<span class="font-italic"> </span>is the adhesive that is used to hold the coping granite at the top structure of the swimming pool vertical wall. The water from the swimming pool will flow over the granite capping edge and cascade down the exterior wall to the overflow channel. The diagrammatic representation of the swimming pool water flow is reproduced by the plaintiff:

class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">526 The plaintiff’s and the third party’s case is that although the water could have seeped out of the screed, this was not a water loss from the swimming pool. The swimming pools here were designed to have a cascading effect, such that water would overflow the pools, across the outer wall. The water that flowed out of these pools would then be collected in an overflow channel and subsequently flow back into a balancing tank. When the pump of this swimming pool system was turned on, the water would be pumped back into the swimming pool and the water level would remain the same. In other words, there would be no nett water loss as a result of the leakage from the screed as that water will find its way down the water cascading wall to the overflow channel. This was the feature of these swimming pools.

On Mr Lee’s evidence when the pumping system was not turned on, the water could leak from the screed down the cascading wall to the overflow drain. This may, perhaps, result in a drop in the water levels. Mr Lee acknowledged that the leak from the screed was a common problem. This can be seen from his evidence, as follows:

</div> The issue is whether painting only three sides of the trellises was in line with the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">548 In my view, it was. When cross-examined, Mr Tan explained that one side of the steel beams was not coated with intumescent paint as they were covered by the timber decking.

</div> The Contract does not contain any express stipulation of how many, and which sides, of the trellis beams must be coated with intumescent paint. Clause 7.1 of the same Contract Drawing No WEB325/GN.01 simply provides that “[a]ll structural steelwork [are] to receive adequate/appropriate fire protection in line with the prescribed fire resistance periods”.

</div> This is affirmed by the fact that a Registered Inspector’s Inspection Certificate has been issued in respect of the Project and Setsco Services Pte Ltd had certified that the Project was compliant with the statutory requirements in relation to fire-proofing (see [546] above). This puts to rest the defendant’s assertion that in order to have “effective fireproofing”, the plaintiff should have fire-proofed all four sides of the steelworks.

</div> The defendant did not adduce any evidence or expert testimony to support this assertion. On the contrary, as I have observed above, the Project has been certified to be compliant with the statutory requirements in relation to fire-proofing. Therefore, I find that the coating of only three sides of the trellises with intumescent paint is compliant with the Contract and does not amount to a defect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">549 For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff is not liable to the defendant in respect of the intumescent paint applied. The fire resistance period of one hour and the painting of the three exposed sides of the trellises are in compliance with the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">550 I shall now deal with the defendant’s allegation that the intumescent paint was defective and had peeled. Based on Mr Chin’s BAPL reports, the defendant alleges that there were several locations at the Project where the intumescent paint had peeled.

</div> However, the plaintiff admits only to the peeling of the intumescent paint as identified in the minutes of a meeting dated 11 February 2015. According to these minutes, after a joint inspection of all three units, only five points of peeling at three beams at Unit 12A were identified. Given my concerns regarding Mr Chin’s evidence, as explained above, I do not think it appropriate to rely on the BAPL Reports to conclude the extent of peeling of the intumescent paint. Indeed, it was not clear from many of the photographs in Mr Chin’s reports whether the intumescent paint was actually peeling. In my view, the minutes of the meeting dated 11 February 2015 are much more reliable, having been the outcome of a joint inspection. Furthermore, it took place several months after the Project was handed over to the defendant. Therefore, results of the joint inspection should be quite indicative of the condition of the Project around the time of handover. Hence, I find that the application of the intumescent paint was defective in so far as it had peeled in respect of three beams in Unit 12A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">551 I turn now to the question of quantification. The sum of $153,700 suggested by the defendant was reached on the premise that the intumescent paint for a <span class="font-italic">two-hour </span>fire rating would be reapplied on <span class="font-italic">all </span>the trellis beams at the Project, and also includes the cost of reapplying the intumescent paint at the steel staircases for the Project.

The court must take into account his failure to expeditiously rectify the defects relating to the peeling of the intumescent paint. Moreover, the defendant also exacerbated his loss by peeling off the top coat of the intumescent paint, which is the protective layer for the intumescent paint.

It is settled law that the third party is the defendant’s agent, although it must act fairly and professionally in the exercise of his functions requiring skill and judgment, such as in assessing EOT requests and payment claims (<span class="font-italic">Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 458 at [16]). As I have explained at [159] above, the third party had the apparent authority to instruct the plaintiff to vary the Works. When the plaintiff was informed by the third party to use plaster and paint instead, the plaintiff was fully entitled to proceed as instructed by the third party.

In fact, the first time the defendant took issue with the finishing of the external boundary wall was when the present suit commenced. It is apparent that this particular alleged defect was included as part of the defendant’s avalanche of defects to overwhelm the plaintiff and the third party.

</div> According to Mr Leong, based on his examination of the photographs provided to him by the plaintiff, the soil used at the Project was loamy soil as it matched the ratio of clay, sand and silt contained in loamy soil. Furthermore, there were laboratory reports from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore which confirmed that the soil used was an ASM which contained loamy soil.

In fact, the use of an ASM instead of loamy soil cannot properly be said to be a defect to begin with. The evidence shows that the ASM is of a better quality and more cost-effective than loamy soil (see [564] above). The price quoted by Creideas for the ASM was higher than the loamy soil.  In fact, Mr Tay agreed that the ASM was better than loamy soil because the ASM was manufactured.

Further, the defects are <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>in nature and does not affect the overall performance of the cappings (see [449]–[454] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The steps and risers were rectified and complied with the statutory requirements after the TOP was issued by the BCA (see [455]–[482] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The intumescent paint has a fire resistance of one hour instead of two hours which is specified under the contract. The contract also makes reference to fire safety requirements which accepted three exposed sides rather than four sides of the trellis beams to be coated with intumescent paint (see [542]–[549] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Although the external boundary wall was not constructed with an off-form finish and was not in line with contractual specifications, the defendant had implicitly agreed to such alterations (see [555]–[560] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The supply and backfilling of the Project with loamy soil was not in line with contractual specifications. However, although this requirement as per AI 26 was not complied with, the defendant suffered no loss as the ASM cost more and was of a better quality than loamy soil (see [561]–[567] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) The sliding glass doors were not defective. Most of the defendant’s allegations regarding the sliding glass doors were raised in November 2014 and were potentially due to a lack of maintenance (see [568]–[570] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">574 The defendant submits that the CC ought not to be issued at all even up till today given the presence of the unrectified defects (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, steps and risers, intumescent paint, trellis beams, external boundary wall, loamy soil, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>). I disagree with the defendant’s submissions. I find that the CC could have been issued on 28 May 2013 (see above at [334]). Based strictly on the plaintiff’s scope of work under the contract, the TOP could easily have been obtained at TOP Inspection 2 as the one non-compliant concrete step at the turf could easily be rectified by topping up the soil at the bottom of the step. The failure of TOP Inspection 2 was also related to other issues not due to the plaintiff’s fault. If the TOP had been issued following TOP Inspection 2, then the defendant could have moved into the three units and utilised the premises as the defects which I have found would not have prevented the defendant from doing so. A reasonable architect would, therefore, have determined that Item 72(c) of the Preliminaries had been fulfilled, thereby allowing the issuance of the CC on 28 May 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">575 Further, in my view, the BCA, an objective and independent agency, had already approved the steps and risers, and the other purported defects were minor works in the opinion of the third party. Clause 24(5) of the SIA Conditions provides that “if any minor works are outstanding … the [third party] may (but shall not be bound to) issue a [CC], which shall record such outstanding work by way of a schedule attached to the certificate …” Hence, Item 72 has been satisfied as of today. Therefore, the third party could have issued the CC on 28 May 2013 although it was premature to issue the CC on 15 May 2013 when the steps and risers failed at TOP Inspection 1. Furthermore, although the intumescent paint relates to safety, it was still in compliance with the statutory requirements set out by the SCDF. Therefore, the earliest date on which the CC should have been issued by the third party remains 28 May 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">576 I now turn to address whether the presence of these defects supports the defendant’s allegation that there was a conspiracy to injure him. I find that the plaintiff and the third party genuinely and honestly believed at the time that there was nothing improper in relation to the intumescent paint, trellis beams and external boundary wall. At best, the evidence only shows that the plaintiff and the third party failed to pay careful attention to the contractual requirements and ought to have sought the defendant’s express consent to depart from these requirements. There is no iota of evidence that there was a conspiracy to injure the defendant. It is a myth that there was a conspiracy and it is a figment of the defendant’s imagination as he opined that the third party favoured the plaintiff, particularly towards the end of the Project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the third party correct when it issued the Payment Certificates?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Did the third party exercise reasonable skill and care?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">577 In relation to the three payment certificates, namely IC25, IC26 and the FC, which are the basis of the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant is not disputing the quantification of the PC Sums. But the defendant alleges that there is no evidence that the plaintiff paid the NSCs the PC Sums. As for the PC Rate items the defendant’s main contention is that the calculation of the PC Rate items by the QS was wrong. Further, the defendant submits that the third party should not have issued the three payment certificates namely, IC25, IC26 and FC, as the third party had failed to conduct an independent verification of the amounts claimed by the plaintiff. The alleged failure to exercise reasonable skill and care comprises three instances:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the failure to withhold the costs of outstanding works in the schedule of the CC until the outstanding works were completed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the release of the first half retention moneys in IC25 without basis;

Although there was a QS in the Project, the certification of the payment claims ultimately rests with the third party. This protocol is confirmed by Mr Ng in his AEIC, where he stated that “it is ultimately up to [the third party] alone to decide whether or not to adopt the Recommended Valuations [from F+G] as the basis for the issuance of its [IC25, IC26] and the FC”.

The third party was entitled to exercise its professional judgment on whether the plaintiff had rectified the defects satisfactorily. In June 2015 when the FC was issued, the Project had already been completed for more than three years. However, the defendant adamantly refused to allow the plaintiff to enter the Project to rectify the outstanding defects.

The CA opined that the failure to properly issue these payment certificates, or a huge unexplained disparity in the sums stated therein, would raise suspicions and lend credence to the defendant’s broader allegation that there was a conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The issuance of IC25</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">590 In relation to IC25, a number of questions were raised by the CA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) firstly, whether the moiety of the retention sum released had been done in compliance with the contractual terms;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, IC25 was issued several months after the CC had been issued and this suggested that there were substantial works to be done after the CC was issued; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) thirdly, whether the amounts certified under IC25 were correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">591 Under IC25, a moiety of the retention sum amounting to $328,250 was released to the plaintiff. In accordance with the Contract, this should only have been 50% of the retention sum, in compliance with cl 31(13) that the Architect “shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the Contract”. In relation to this, the CA observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 The Architect failed to certify the release of one moiety of the retention sum upon issuing his Completion Certificate, as he should have under cl 31(9) of the SIA Conditions. Clause 31(9) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to Clauses 25 and 26 of these Conditions in regard to Phased or Stage Completion or Partial Occupation, <span class="font-italic">one-half of the Retention Monies not yet paid </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall be certified</span><span class="font-italic"> as due to the Contractor </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on the issue of the Completion Certificate under Clause 24.(4)</span><span class="font-italic"> of these Conditions</span>, less only a reasonable sum to cover the cost of outstanding work (if any) not yet completed pursuant to Clause 24.(5) of these Conditions at the date of the said Certificate. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whilst cl 31(9) allows the Architect to withhold a reasonable sum to cover the cost of outstanding work not yet completed, if any, there is no evidence from the Architect that this was the case or that it was withheld for that reason. Instead, IC 25 was issued some 4½ months after the works were, in the opinion of the Architect, ‘complete’ and complied in all respects with the contract and some three months and 19 days after he issued his Completion Certificate. The evidence shows the full moiety of the retention sum was released. In Interim Certificate 24 dated 1 July 2013 (‘IC 24’), the retention sum was $644,195.65. In IC 25 (dated 3 September 2013) the retention sum was reduced to $315,945.65. The retention sum released to the Respondent was thus $328,250 or approximately 51% of the retention sum certified in IC 24. There is <span class="font-italic">no</span> explanation from the Architect whatsoever, despite his acknowledging in para 36 of his affidavit that 50% of the ‘retention sum <span class="font-italic">… had to be released</span> upon the issuance of the Completion Certificate’ [emphasis added]. IC 25 clearly did not comply with cl 31(13)’s stricture that the Architect ‘shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract’. The interim certificate is invalidly issued and, therefore, cannot have any temporary finality under the SIA Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[CA’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Court of Appeal</span>)]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">592 On the evidence before the CA, it appeared that the sum of $328,250 amounted to 51% of the retention sum listed under Interim Certificate 24 (“IC24”) dated 1 July 2013, which was listed as $644,195.65. However, the evidence before me shows that the total retention sum was not $644,195.65 as in IC24. In the Statement of Retention in Interim Valuation 24 adduced before the court,

</div> the first page of which is annexed to this Judgment as Annex A. In IC24, the third party provided a list of values for contractual works and materials. These were works and materials that were certified as being carried out and delivered, pursuant to cl 31(1) of the SIA Conditions. These fell into three broad categories, namely: (a) work carried out by the Contractor; (b) unfixed goods and materials; and (c) nominated sub-contractor or supplier or designated PC work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">594 Under each of the specific items, the third party listed the term “(less retention)” where relevant. These indicated the retention sums that were calculated with reference to that specific type of work. It is here that the confusion arises. Under the first category of “work carried out by the Contractor”, a sum of $644,195.65 was listed as the retention sum relevant to those works. This was the figure that the CA had utilised in its deliberations. At first blush, it would appear that this was indeed the correct figure to be utilised since it referred to the works that the plaintiff had carried out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">595 However, as was explained in court, this was not the full retention sum for the Project, as two other sums had to be added in. These other retention sums are found under the category of “nominated sub-contractor or supplier or designated PC work”, specifically item (b) “Built-in-Kitchen Cabinet &amp; Appliances”, and item (c) “Built-in Wardrobe/Cabinet”. The retention sums for these items were $6,910.57 and $5,393.78 respectively. Although they were listed as works completed by parties other than the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the NSCs, these works were still completed as part of the Project and the retention sums are still relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">596 The full and accurate figure for the Project’s retention sum can, thus, only be derived by adding $644,195.65, $6,910.57 and $5,393.78, amounting to a total of $656,500.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">599 I turn now to the issues relating to the apparent delay in the issuance of IC25, and whether substantial works were only completed after the CC had been issued. This issue was alluded to at [70] of <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) (see above at [591]). The CA further stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 We also find it strange that the Respondent did not appear to have made any complaint about the late release of the retention sum, especially since it appears that the Respondent was, on its own admission, in a weak financial position … Dennis Tan had this to say in an affidavit filed in related proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, OS 317/2014:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [Respondent], in consideration of EQ Insurance Company Limited issuing the Performance Bond, have in turn executed an Indemnity in respect of the Performance Bond together with myself and another of the [Respondent’s] director, Ms Phua Poh Hua. If the Performance Bond is allowed to be called upon, EQ would proceed against us and we can ill afford to pay and will probably be wound up or the Directors bankrupted thus preventing us from continuing with Suit No. 50 of 2014 [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the suit commenced by the Respondent for recovery of the sums owed under IC 25 and 26].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 Most contractors, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, a contractor with financial issues, would be eagerly waiting for this release of a moiety of the retention sum and one would not expect a contractor to remain silent when this not insignificant sum was not being certified for release upon issue of the Completion Certificate. Indeed, the Judge who heard SUM 5454/2014 granted the application for stay of execution of his Judgment precisely because there must have been concerns over the Respondent’s financial position … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 The foregoing would invalidate IC 25. However, the amount certified in IC 25 is also questionable. IC 25 is dated 3 September 2013 and as noted above, certified payment of $390,951.96, of which $328,250 comprised the release of the first moiety of the retention sum under cl 31(9) of the SIA Conditions. IC 26 dated 6 November 2013 certified payment of $189.250.21. If works were complete as of 17 April 2013 and the works complied with the contract in all respects and fulfilled all the requirements of Item 72, why are these sums for work done being certified for payment months after certified completion on the terms of this contract? In so asking, we should not be taken to rule that there can never be interim payment certificates after completion. There are a number of valid reasons why such certificates may be issued, including correcting undervaluation of previous certificates (see cl 31(6)), items that were previously missed out by the parties, payment for variations (especially those that were issued late in the course of the project), or claims for work done in the month before completion. The Appellant makes this point in his affidavit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he Completion Certificate is indicative of the fact that the Contract has been completed and performed in all respects. The fact that S$917,228.26 was certified by the Architects in Interim Certificates No. 23 to 26 indicates that there was still a significant amount of work to be done as of the date of Completion as certified by the Architects and not just minor works as suggested by the Architects in their Completion Certificate. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 It does seem incongruent that if the works were as complete as the contract required and as certified by the Architect, and given the scheme of interim claims and interim payments under the SIA Conditions, interim payment certificates were being issued some 4½ months and 6½ months after contract completion. It is also uncharacteristic for a contractor with financial issues to wait so long after having completed his works to make his interim payment claims. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Architect offers no explanation in his affidavit. He merely deposes at paras 35 and 51:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35. … The value of works certified in Interim Certificates No. 23 to 26 of $917,228.26 were for works carried out prior to completion or for sums payable as a consequence of completion and are not as the Defendant claims indicative of an alleged ‘significant amount of work to be done’ as at the date of completion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51. Interim Certificates No. 25 and 26 were for works completed, and are unrelated to the defects.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 In one sense, paragraph 51 is true. The certificates are unrelated to the defects. An examination of the ‘minor’ defective items listed in Annexes 1.1 to 1.4 of the Completion Certificate (comprising some 109 pages of photographs with captioned ‘defects’) in relation to Unit Nos 12, 12A, 12B and the external works show just that, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, minor items for rectification, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ceiling painting patchy, hole at ceiling to patch, remove floor marble stain, timber floor surface damaged, edge of wall painting to touch-up, aluminium window lockset loosen, cabinet doors not flush, aluminium capping loosened, <span class="font-italic">etc. </span>These are not works for which payment under the contract is due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">600 At the hearing before the CA, as seen from [76]–[78] of <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>), the third party did not adequately explain the certification of IC25 and IC26, which were disputed by the defendant. The third party was not a party to the proceedings at the summary proceeding stage taken out by the plaintiff against the defendant. It was, therefore, difficult for the CA to grant enforcement of these payment certificates, when the “temporary finality of [the third party’s] certificates [were] in question” (see <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Court of Appeal) </span>at [77]). Indeed, Interim Certificate 23 (“IC23”) was issued on 5 June 2013, IC24 was issued on 1 July 2013, IC25 was issued on 3 September 2013 and IC26 on 6 November 2013. All of these interim certificates for payment were granted long after the date of the issuance of the CC on 15 May 2013. Thus, the CA found it strange that the third party did not explain the certification process although the third party gave detailed explanations for the EOTs and the alleged defects. In this trial, the third party explained the procedure for the issuance of interim certificates, the purported delay in the issuance of the payment certificates. The third party explained that the issuance of the interim certificates and the state of building works are two different matters and these two activities were not necessarily correlated. The explanation lies in understanding the procedure resulting in the issuance of a payment certificate which is as follows:

It depends on when the contractor claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">602 The evidence before this court is that the <span class="font-italic">issuance of the payment certificates</span> was <span class="font-italic">independent</span><span class="font-italic"> of</span> when the works were <span class="font-italic">actually completed</span>. However, the works had to be completed before the plaintiff could submit its progress payment claim. After the works were completed it was left to the plaintiff to submit its progress payment claim with supporting documents. Hence, the date of the third party’s interim certificate depended on when the plaintiff submitted its progress payment claim. In this instance, Payment Claim 25 leading to IC25 was filed by the plaintiff on 26 August 2013 while Payment Claim 26 leading to IC26 was filed by the plaintiff on 29 October 2013. The plaintiff filed its final account documents on 15 July 2015.

</div>
</div> In these circumstances, the dates on which IC25, IC26 and the FC were issued were not out of the ordinary from the third party’s point of view.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">603 The evidence in this court shows that when the CC was issued, the third party and the Consultants were satisfied that the Project had been completed according to the approved building plans. This was confirmed at their meeting on 15 April 2013 and verified in their site meeting on 17 April 2013. In other words, in the view of the third party and the Consultants of the Project, the plaintiff had completed its works on 17 April 2013 under the Contract except for minor works that were listed by the third party in the schedule to the CC. Although the plaintiff had completed its building works under the contract, it had yet to submit Progress Claims 23 to 26 when the CC was issued, and the corresponding interim certificates were similarly not yet issued. Hence, the state of completion and the issuance of the interim certificates are two different issues and the interim certificate is not indicative of the state of building works at the time it was issued. The state of completion was independently evaluated by the third party and the Consultants, whereas the interim certificate was the result of the plaintiff’s submission of his progress claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was purely an accounting exercise. Hence, there can be a situation in which the works have already been completed for some time but the contractor for whatever reasons may have submitted his claim much later. The contractor, of course, would ideally like to submit its claim as soon as possible so that payment could be made expeditiously. However, the justification for the claim process may take time to prepare and the contractor may have limited manpower resources, which might make immediate submission of the claim not possible. This was what happened in this case in which IC23 to IC26 were issued after the CC. The defendant paid IC23 and IC24 but not IC25 and IC26.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">604 Therefore, it may not be accurate to determine the state of the building works purely based on the dates of the interim certificates. The CA, with limited evidence, tried to make sense of IC25 and IC26. However, with the deepest respect, the CA mistakenly equated the amount of work done with the outstanding interim certificates issued by the third party, namely IC25 and IC26, and came to the conclusion that the CC was wrongly issued as there were substantial building works that had not been completed. This, perhaps, explains why the defendant did not pursue this issue and plead that IC25 and IC26 which were issued much later after the issuance of the CC showed that the Project was incomplete despite the findings of the CA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">605 It is also evident that the Works were complete, in the opinion of the third party and the Consultants, when the CC was issued. On 15 April 2013, two days prior to the issuance of the CC on 17 April 2013, the third party conducted a meeting with the Consultants, including F+G and CCA, to satisfy itself that the Project was completed. At this meeting, the third party informed the Consultants that it intended to issue the CC, certifying that all the Works were completed. The Consultants were also in agreement that their respective spheres of Works had been completed. The third party further informed the Consultants that there would be an inspection of the Project two days later (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 17 April 2013). The purpose of the inspection was to ensure that all Works had been completed and done in accordance with the contractual drawings and the Contract in relation to all the individual departments, for instance, the M&amp;E works, structural works or architectural works. At the site inspection on 17 April 2013, the third party and the Consultants were satisfied that the Project was completed, save for some minor works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">606 Why then, did the plaintiff make “late submissions” of Payment Claim 25 (“PC 25”) and Payment Claim 26 (“PC 26”)?

There are many factors and reasons behind it, but you cannot say that you just look at the variation and say that, “Oh, I’m paying up to 80 per cent so it means the project is 80 per cent done.” The progress report would be a more appropriate document to look at. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: So you need to look at other evidence in order to establish what is the extent of the work to be done.

At para 17, he states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The $337,892.94 worth of work was not done after completion. The amount certified was not because of the work being done after completion but because of the PC rate adjustments.  The [Respondent] had completed all the PC rate items like marble, tiles, granite, timber parquet, timber decking by Mar 2012 (see under Main Building Works for Interim Valuation from No.22 to No.25 … wherein the amounts were capped at about 95% until PC rates are adjusted on a later date. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dennis Tan’s explanation is not only quite unconvincing, it is instead misleading by making reference across five payment certificates, IC 22 to IC 26, because they stretch from an interim valuation (“Interim Valuation”) as of 14 March 2013 (about one month before ‘completion’) to 31 October 2013. We should point out that the interim certificates do not show the PC items. We have to look at the accompanying Interim Valuation for the ‘Prime Cost &amp; Provisional Sums’ (‘the PC Items’). A perusal of the Interim Valuation by M/s Faithful &amp; Gould, the quantity surveyors, shows there was indeed an increase in the PC Items, but that occurred between the Interim Valuation for IC 23 and IC 24.

The PC Sum items were provided by the defendant’s NSCs. The value of these PC Sum items was included under S/N 2 of the Summary (“Prime Cost &amp; Provisional Items”). In this Project, according to Mr Yong and Mr Ng there were no Provisional Items. Thus, S/N 2 of the Summary should have been “PC Sum Items”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">PC Rate items</span>: PC Rate items constituted those that were calculated in the Project based on a rate per square metre. Examples of such PC Rate items include the supply of marbles, tiles, Indian rosewood and ironwood. These items were also provided by the defendant’s NSCs. The values of these PC Rate items are included within S/N 3 of the Summary (“Main Building Works”) and S/N 4 of the Summary (“External Works”) for each of the three units. For the relevant IVs (namely IV25, IV26 and IV27), however, there were no PC Rate items for “External Works”. Therefore, I shall refer solely to S/N 3 of the Summary for the PC Rate items under these IVs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">PC Rate adjustments</span>: F+G had to value PC Rate items that were actually used for the Project against the estimated sum in the Contract and make adjustments accordingly. This was carried out in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The PC Rate items were entered under the “Main Building Works” at S/N 3 of the Summary. Payment for PC Rate items in IV 26 is stated under the column “Net Amounts Recommended for Payment” and the values are as follows: $113,590.77 for Unit 12, $115,474.38 for Unit 12A and $108,827.79 for Unit 12B.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The above figures for PC Rate items have to take into account the variations for these items which are indicated under “Building Works” in S/N 7 of the Summary. The variations take into account any differences between the PC Rate items that were actually used in the Project and the budgeted PC Rate items in the contract, either in terms of the quantity used or the price of the material per square metre. For IV26 under S/N 7 there is a negative figure of ($185,287.91). This means there was a saving of $185,287.91 for the PC Rate items when compared to the Contract sum.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">According to the Summary, the PC Rate adjustments were conducted separately from the PC Sum adjustments. Thus, PC Rate adjustments had no effect on the PC Sum items.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold">PC Sum adjustments</span>: F+G had to value the PC Sum items that were actually used for the Project against the estimated sum in the Contract and make adjustments accordingly. This, however, was only done in the final accounts, unlike the PC Rate adjustments that were done at the stage of IV26. The PC Sum adjustments were carried out in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The PC Sum items were entered under the “Prime Cost &amp; Provisional Sums” at S/N 2 of the Summary. According to Mr Ng there were no Provisional Sums in the Project. Thus, S/N 2 of the Summary should be called PC Sum as it deals solely with PC Sum items and not Prime Cost and Provisional Sums. The payment for PC Sum items in IV27 (Final) is indicated under the column “Net Amount Recommended for Payment” for the sum of $437,843.91.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The above figure for PC Sum items has to take into account the variations for these items under “Building Works” in S/N 7 of the Summary. For IV27 (Final), under S/N 7 there is a negative figure “(322,146.02)”. This has to be subtracted from the sum of $437,843.91 as part of the adjustment for PC Sum items.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-weight-bold">PC items</span>: The PC items in the Summary do not refer to both PC <span class="font-italic">Sum</span> items and PC <span class="font-italic">Rate</span> items. PC items refer only to PC Sum items in the Project. In <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>), the term “PC items” was utilised as a shortened form of the phrase “prime cost and provisional sums”. This phrase refers to the PC Sum items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">611 There was some confusion regarding PC Rate and PC Sum in the Summary which led to the CA rejecting Mr Tan’s explanation. The confusion arose because the Summary does not clearly state the PC Sum and PC Rate items. The PC Sum items are in S/N 2 and the adjustment for the PC Sum items was done in the final account. On the other hand, the PC Rate items are co-mingled with the Building Works in S/N 3(a) and Exterior Works in S/N 3(b) of the Summary. Furthermore, the PC Rate figures in S/N 3(a) and 3(b) have to be adjusted with the variation at S/N 7, especially in IV26. Mr Tan’s explanation in his third affidavit dated 30 April 2014 was referred to by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) at [78] (see [609] above). He said that for IV26 the PC Rate under the “Main Building Works” for the three units had to be adjusted against the “Variation” in S/N 7 of the Summary. This was rejected by the CA because the PC items only reflected an amount of $19.19 as the “Net Amount Recommended for Payment” under IV26. On that basis, the CA concluded that there could not have been any PC Rate adjustments for IV26. Unfortunately, when the CA referred to the PC items under the “PC and Provisional Sum” in S/N 2 of the Summary, that referred not to PC Rate items but to PC Sums. Thus, the comparison is not of the same items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">612 Hence, a change in the values of the PC Sum items is completely different from any PC Rate adjustments.

</div> Instead, the process for the PC Rate adjustments is as explained in [610(c)(i)] and [610(c)(ii)] above. The figure of 337,892.94 emerges when one sums up the three figures for the three units listed at [610(c)(i)] above, as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Cumulative Amount Recommended for Payment</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">IV25</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">IV26</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Change</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unit 12</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,549,179.32</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,662,770.09</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+113,590.77</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unit 12A</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,448,269.62</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,563,744.00</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+115,474.38</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unit 12B</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,315,084.55</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,423,912.34</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+108,827.79</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-right font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+337,892.94</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">613 The sum of $337,892.94 was, therefore, a result of the addition of the sums referred to above at [610(c)(i)]. The PC Rate figure had to be adjusted before payment to the plaintiff could be made as there was a variation for “Builder’s Work” at S/N 7 of the Summary. This is the negative figure of “($185,287.91)” and it had to be subtracted from the sum of $337,892.94. This confusion could only have been cleared during the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">614 This was confirmed by Mr Yong in the trial, as follows:

What Mr Dennis Tan was trying to explain is that the reason the main building works’ sums increase is because of the PC rate adjustment, but you have to read this in conjunction with the negative variation PC rate adjustment below. And as the previous amounts were not certified up to 100 per cent of the value of PC rate items, after this sum is regularised and calculated, which takes quite some time, which is why it's usually only done at the end, you will see a net sum of $152,000 certified to GTMS under IC26.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Yong, do you agree that this is exactly what Mr Dennis Tan stated in 2014, that the PC rate adjustments were made in IC26?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Yes, the PC rate adjustment is made in IC26.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: So this adjustment wasn't done at the final certificate, is it?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Sometimes it's also done partially in the final certificates, but in this case it is –– basically, it's the QS that decides when you can actually go about doing it.  So as much as possible, if all the items are clear, everybody has a clear understanding of the area, the changes and all this, they can go ahead and start going through this process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">615 Furthermore, the sums in IV26 did not mean that the Works were only belatedly completed after IC25 had been issued. This was explained by Mr Yong, as follows:

It’s only rectification work. The only new works, if you would like to consider, is the barricades that raised by BCA for safety, the invisible grill that is changed to glass. Those were the few items that was technically new items.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">616 Mr Ng, the QS, also agreed with Mr Yong that IV23, IV24 and IV25 which were processed after the issuance of the CC did not mean that the Project was not completed on 17 April 2013. This can be seen from the exchange between myself and Mr Ng which I have quoted extensively at [608] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">617 This is in stark contrast to the observations made by the CA on this issue at [79] and [80]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">79 … Secondly, the main building works were 95.73%, 95.5% and 95.51% (for Unit No 12, 12A and 12B respectively) complete by value in Interim Valuation 22, on which IC 22 was based, and this figure remained constant from IC 22 to IC 25.

Secondly, this fact, <span class="font-italic">ex facie,</span> shows that there were no further works done between the issue of IC 23 dated 30 April 2013 and IC 25 dated 3 September 2013 as valued by the quantity surveyor because the level of completion of these units by value did not change. On the evidence before us, IC 25’s $62,701.96 (the remainder after deducting $328,250 of retention monies released) could not have been for any PC rate adjustments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">618 At first blush, the CA’s observations appeared logical. In addition to the above, the “Net Amount Recommended for Payment” for the “Main Building Works”, listed under row S/N 2 of the Summary, remained at zero in IV23, IV24 and IV25. It was only in IV26 that the sum of $337,892.94 was recommended to be paid to the plaintiff, suggesting that it was only then that the Works had been completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">619 Again, it was only with the full benefit of the trial process as well as the further evidence and detailed explanation from the parties that it is clear that the amount claimed or subsequently certified by the third party did not represent the state of the building works. In IV22 to IV25, the valuation of the “Main Building Works” for Units 12, 12A and 12B for PC 22 to PC 25 submitted by the plaintiff had consistently remained at 95.73%, 95.50% and 95.51% respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">620 This was not because almost 5% of the building works in each of the houses had remained incomplete even though the CC had already been issued. Instead, the figures remained capped at those values pending the PC Rate adjustments. This was explained by Mr Ng in court as follows:

The main issues that arose can be distilled into two broad grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Similar to IC25, questions were raised in relation to the sums certified, whether they were in relation to PC Rate adjustments and when the Works had been completed (<span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) at [82]–[87]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the sums for the M&amp;E works in IC26 were accurately accounted for (<span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) at [88]–[91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">623 In relation to the first ground, given the overlap in issues raised regarding IC25 and IC26, my observations as above in [590]–[620] apply <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandis</span> to IC26. I shall simply summarise the following points that have arisen as a result of the evidence produced in the hearing before me:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Unlike the previous ICs, IC26 took into account PC Rate adjustments, as explained in [610(c)], [612]–[613].

</div> The changes are reflected in the amounts paid for “Main Building Works” in the row of S/N 3 of the Summary and the variations for “Builder’s Works” in the row of S/N 7(a) of the Summary.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Therefore, the changes in the valuation amount in IC26 were not as a result of works being valued after completion or the issuance of the CC. It is clear that the relevant works had already been carried out prior to completion and the third party and the Consultants were satisfied that the Project was complete.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As a corollary, the items and valuations certified in IC26 were done accurately and were properly accounted for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">624 It is the second ground, which raises a new issue in relation to the M&amp;E items, that I now focus on. In this regard, the relevant paragraphs from <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi </span>(<span class="font-italic">Court of Appeal</span>) are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87 The Respondent has attempted to support its explanation by annexing a table in Dennis Tan’s third affidavit, entitled ‘Leedon Park – Comparison Table of Interim Valuation No. 25 &amp; 26’. Here, the Respondent purports to provide some figures to account for the PC rate adjustments. First and foremost, this table is that of the Respondent, not the Architect or the quantity surveyor. Secondly, these figures and remarks cannot be readily matched against the figures reflected in the ‘Prime Cost &amp; Provisional Sums’ column on Interim Valuation No 26. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88 A similar trend appears in the accounting of the M&amp;E works:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In Interim Valuation No 23 (‘IV 23’), on which IC 23 was based, as of 30 April 2013, the M&amp;E works for the Buildings was claimed and valued at $1,980,795.78 and this comprised 86.35% of the contracted sum for M&amp;E works.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) In Interim Valuation No 24 (‘IV 24’), on which IC 24 was based, as of 30 May 2013, the M&amp;E works for the Buildings was valued at $2,002,712.59 which comprised 87.3% of the contracted sum, an increase of $21,916.81 or 0.95% of the contracted sum. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In Interim Valuation No 25 (‘IV 25’) on which IC 25 was based, as of 31 July 2013, the M&amp;E works for Buildings was valued at, $2,031,200.59, which comprised 88.54% of the contract sum, an increase of $28,488 or 1.24% of the contracted sum. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) In Interim Valuation No 26 (‘IV 26’), on which IC 26 was based, as of 31 October 2013, the M&amp;E works for the Buildings had suddenly increased to $2,267,956 or 98.86% by value of the contracted sum. This was an increase of $236,755.41 or 10.32% of the contracted sum. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 These facts raise similar questions but with heightened significance because first, these are M&amp;E items, and secondly they are explicit requirements stipulated in Item 72. The M&amp;E works were only 86.35% complete by value as of 30 April 2013. They increased marginally by 2.19% through IC 24 to IC 25. Unless there were omissions or sums withheld over quality issues, of which no evidence at all has been proffered, it defies belief that at 86.35% completion by value, all services, including M&amp;E services, could have been tested, commissioned and found to be operating satisfactorily. If at all so, then there is no explanation as to the sudden increase of M&amp;E work by 10.32% in IC 26. Needless to say there is no explanation from the Architect or the M&amp;E Consultant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 Although it is not for the Respondent to explain the Architect’s certification, again the Respondent has attempted to explain the figures by stating that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he omission of $205,605.41 is separated under Interim Valuation No.26 whereas it was still under M&amp;E Works in Interim Valuation No.25 … In fact, the amount certified for Interim Valuation No.26 was only $31,150.00 because the physical works were already completed before 17.4.13. This certified sum is for the submission of operation manual and drawings and the regularization of the contract sum arising from variation works … $236,755.41 worth of M&amp;E work was not done after completion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91 This explanation by the Respondent is difficult to understand or follow but the following points can be made: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first point to note is the admission by the Respondent that IC 26’s payment for M&amp;E items was for the submission of ‘operation manuals’. This means Item 72(b) was not fully complied with until after IV 25 which valued works as at 31 July 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The next point of note is the Respondent’s cryptic remarks referring to an omission of $205,605.41 which ‘was separated’ in IC 26 whereas it was ‘still under M&amp;E works in [IC 25]’. The Respondent then states that the net certification for M&amp;E works in IC 26 was only $31,150 which was for the submission of operation manuals, drawings and ‘the regularization of the contract sum arising from variation works’. It is difficult to make much sense of these statements.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) On their face, the interim certificates (as is usual in the industry) do not have a sufficient level of breakdown to validate the first point made in Dennis Tan’s statement above at (b), <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, it does not contain a separate M&amp;E component, let alone the figure $205,605.41, as M&amp;E works are within the item: ‘Work carried out by Contractor: $11,334,625.80’ (for IC 25).  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) When we turn to the immediate underlying document, the Interim Valuation by the quantity surveyors, IV 25 only shows the M&amp;E works as a one-line item containing the M&amp;E contract sum, the contractor’s claim, the valuation and remarks. It is important to note that it <span class="font-italic">does not show </span>an omission of $205,605.41 since the M&amp;E contract sums remains at $2,294,002 and the respondent’s claim and QS valuation stands at $2,031,200.59 (and in IV 24, the same M&amp;E contract sum appears with a contractor’s claim and QS valuation of $2,002,712.59). There is no other notation showing an omission of that nature or sum on the rest of that document comprising IV 25.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) In IV 26, although the same one-line M&amp;E contract sum of $2,294,002 is stated, as noted before, the contractor’s claim and valuation by the QS is now $2,267,956.00, an increase of $236,755.41 which is 98.86% of the M&amp;E contract value. However, we now find the $205,605.41 figure stated by Dennis Tan in IV 26. It appears as Item 7 variations at (b), where there is an omission of $205,605.41. No such omission appears in the earlier interim valuations. Half of Dennis Tan’s first point is correct – we do find that omission in IV 26. However, his point that the $205,605.41 omission in IV 25 was under M&amp;E Works is not correct.   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) We now move down a further level, since these are M&amp;E works, to examine the M&amp;E consultants’ valuation and payment recommendations (‘M&amp;E Valuation’); again some, but not all or complete copies, are exhibited in Dennis Tan’s affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) As a preliminary point, the M&amp;E Valuations are confusing because they carry the same progress claim number 26 but have different dates which seem to indicate that M&amp;E Valuation No 26 dated 12 August 2013  should be No 25 and the M&amp;E Valuation No 26 dated 30 September 2013  is properly numbered ‘26’. We treat this accordingly and although someone has written in manuscript ‘25’ for both documents, we ignore this manuscript notation. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h) M&amp;E Valuation No 25 shows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The M&amp;E original contract/subcontract value at $2,294,002 which is, as expected, consistent with the figure set out in IV 25, and where, as noted above, as at 31 July 2013, the amount claimed and valued was $2,031,200.59 or 88.54% of the contract value.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) It records, for the first time, variations (additions) EI 01 to EI 04 amounting to $218,106.59 and, as one would expect, an increased present contract/subcontract value by that amount to $2,512,108.59.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) The previous M&amp;E Valuation, numbered 24 and dated 6 June 2013 states no variations orders issued ‘to date’; unless there is an explanation put forward, and there is none, the conclusion to be legitimately drawn is that EI 01 to EI 04 were issued after M&amp;E Valuation 24; we note that EI 01 to EI 04 were not put in evidence although they could have shed some light on this. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) This raises questions as to what M&amp;E works were being ordered at this stage, at or more than 3½ months after works were certified ‘complete’. No explanation has been given by any party.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(v) We should in fairness point out that there <span class="font-italic">may</span> be an answer at a document entitled Cost Report No 6 which carries the date 15 January 2013 (but which we note may not be the full document), where there are items with sums corresponding or approximately corresponding to those found in these EIs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-3 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A) EI 01 for $4,635 has a corresponding sum in this document against S/No 26, AI No 18, ‘Additional of Emergency Lights’ with the remarks 'Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 01, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-3 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(B) EI 02 for $194,800.59 has an approximate corresponding sum in this document at S/No 25, AI No 16 where the first line carries the words: ‘Omission of Provisional Sum ($400,000)’ and the second line has ‘Supply and delivery of light fittings and accessories $196,748.60’ and with similar remarks: ‘Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 02, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-3 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(C) EI 03 for $2,640 has a corresponding sum in this document against S/No 27, AI No 23 with the words: ‘Supply and install water sub-meters for swimming pools’ and with similar remarks: ‘Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 03, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-3 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(D) EI 04 for $16,031 has a corresponding sum in this document at S/No 23, AI No 3 with the words: ‘Additional jacuzzi jet’ and with similar remarks: ‘As advised by M&amp;E Engineer’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(vi) This raises more questions than it provides possible answers. The obvious question arises from the discrepancy in the date of this document and the dates recorded in the M&amp;E Valuations for the EIs. There is no explanation as to the nature of this document, what it represents or whether AI means Architect’s Instructions under the SIA Conditions or just costings for consideration of these items and not necessarily items that were in fact ordered and installed. It also does not tell us whether the works comprised in these items were carried out or not and, if so, when. If these were variations ordered by January 2013, then at least IC 22 (19 April 2013) and the interim certificates after that, and probably a few interim certificates prior to that, were wrong and under-certified. This would include IC 23 and IC 24. Importantly, we do not know if this is a complete document and, equally importantly, there were other items in this document which do not appear in the EIs set out in M&amp;E Valuation No 25 as one would expect, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, S/No 28, AI No 25 with the description: ‘Supply and delivery of light fittings and accessories’, ‘21,453.421’ and with the remarks: ‘As advised by M&amp;E Engineer’.    </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) M&amp;E Valuation No 26 shows the original contract/subcontract value at $2,294,002 as well as EI 01 to EI 04, but there is now an EI 05 which records an omission of $423,712 thereby bringing the revised M&amp;E subcontract value down to $2,088,396.59. EI 05 has also not been put in evidence. This raises the following doubts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Why was such a large omission being effected by an EI at this late stage? There is no explanation as to what these <span class="font-italic">M&amp;E omissions</span> comprised of. Importantly, if the contract works were completed as of 17 April 2013, that there can be an omission of this size and at this stage cries out for a compelling explanation. It is possible for works to be omitted for various reasons including reducing the amount of works for cost or aesthetic considerations or because they were no longer needed or because the contractor cannot supply or do the works or that parts of the M&amp;E works were no longer necessary. Reasons like this should bring about an omission by an EI at a much earlier point in time and <span class="font-italic">before</span> completion. Unfortunately the Architect and M&amp;E consultant have chosen to remain silent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Although Dennis Tan seems to suggest a specific omission or omissions amounting to $205,605.41 that was within IC 25, which as we have said above cannot be the case, it seems that that figure comes from deducting $218,106.59 comprised in EI 01 to EI 04 (issued after 6 June 2013) from this omission of $423,712 by EI 05 in or around 30 September 2013. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Importantly, if an omission of this large sum occurred before completion on 17 April 2013, or at some earlier stage and was being accounted for only in M&amp;E Valuation No 26 and/or IV 26, in the sense of reducing the M&amp;E contract sum only at that stage, then the previous valuations of works done by the M&amp;E consultants and the quantity surveyors were erroneous and any interim certificate based on these valuations would be similarly erroneous and invalid and certainly could not be clothed with temporary finality under cl 31(13);  $423,712 is an omission of 18.47% of the original M&amp;E subcontract sum or 16.86% of the revised M&amp;E subcontract value after adding EI 01 to EI 04.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">625 The numerous questions that arose in the CA’s determination were undoubtedly caused, once again, by the documentary evidence, or lack thereof. Having had the full account of the IVs that were adduced before me, I find that there was indeed a reasonable explanation for the valuations certified in IC26. I shall now elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">626 For M&amp;E works, the various values are reflected in the row of S/N 5 of the Summary. Under IV26, in the column of “Cumulative Amount Recommended for Payment”, a figure of $2,267,956.00 was listed for M&amp;E works. In contrast, in the column of “Cumulative Amount Recommended for Payment”, a corresponding figure of only $2,031,200.59 for M&amp;E works was listed under IV25. The difference between the two values is $236,755.41 and is listed as “Net Amount Recommended for Payment” under IV26. As the CA observed, this was an increase of 10.32% of the contract sum for M&amp;E works, which was reflected as $2,294,002.00 under the “Contract Sum” column. Therefore, it appeared that only 10.32% of the M&amp;E works had been completed during this time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">627 As with the PC Rate items, however, it was explained at the trial that M&amp;E works were also subjected to a variation sum before payment to the plaintiff. This was reflected in the row of S/N 7(b) of the Summary as “Variations – M&amp;E Works”. This variation sum for M&amp;E Works is found in the column “Net Amounts for Payment” for IV26, listed as “(205,605.41)”, indicating that $205,605.41 was to be subtracted.

This was a far cry from the 10.32% noted above in [626]. The implication of this was that prior to this, at least 98.64% of the M&amp;E works had been <span class="font-italic">certified </span>for <span class="font-italic">payment</span>. There was, therefore, no sudden unexplained increase in the M&amp;E works completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">630 A more fundamental question, however, arises as to the extent of M&amp;E works that had been done as at the date of completion. It bears emphasizing that as with the PC items above at [602], the date of certification for M&amp;E works was <span class="font-italic">not </span>indicative of the date on which the works were actually completed. This is unsurprising, given that the process of certification for M&amp;E works was similar to that of PC items, with CCA and F+G both following the same process listed above at [600]. The certification of the M&amp;E works was, therefore, only dependent on when the plaintiff submitted its claim for the works. Given the plaintiff’s delay in submitting its payment claims for the PC Sum items, as  explained above at [606]–[608], it is also to be expected that there were delays in the submission of its payment claims for the M&amp;E works. Nevertheless, it is clear that the M&amp;E works were also completed as at the date of the issuance of the CC. This follows from the rigorous process of inspection by the third party and the Consultants, as explained above at [603]. This was confirmed by Ms Chua at the trial:

</div> Moreover, during the construction there will often be changes in specifications, be it in relation to materials or quality, quantity, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Such changes result from a variety of reasons, but will naturally have an impact on the value of the works actually done. This is why even the measured sum, that is based on contractual rates and drawings, differs from the value of the actual work completed.

To use the contractor’s tender breakdown prices that are not derived from any rates or measurements related to the works itself may not be a fair and equitable method of adjustment for the PC Rate items. Mr Ng testified that in his opinion as a QS, his method was the “fair and reasonable way to make such adjustment[s]”.

</div> I agree with Mr Ng that the method he had utilised, which was also that advocated by the plaintiff and the third party, is eminently fairer. This is evident when one compares the two methods alongside each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">640 This is best illustrated via a simple hypothetical example. First, assume a contract with only <span class="font-italic">one </span>PC Rate item and <span class="font-italic">one</span> non-PC Rate item. Based on the contract drawings and the PC Rate, the <span class="font-italic">measured sum</span> for the PC Rate item is $5,000. However, in the schedule of prices, the contractor has indicated a lower <span class="font-italic">tender breakdown price</span> of $3,000 for the PC Rate item. As noted above at [638], there is some room for variability as to the tender breakdown price depending on the contractor’s pricing strategy. Furthermore, the contractor has priced the <span class="font-italic">non-PC Rate item</span> as $10,000. This results in an overall contract sum of $13,000. Next, assume that the contract was completed and there were <span class="font-italic">no changes </span>to the PC Rate or the quantities used as the as-built drawings matched the contract drawings exactly. After applying the adjustment process of deducting the “relevant” sum and adding the actual sum expended, the result under each method of calculation would be as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Adjustment process</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">F+G’s method ($)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendant’s method ($)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Initial contract sum</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">13,000</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">13,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Relevant sum </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">- 5,000 </div><div class="txt-body text-right">(the measured sum)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">- 3,000 </div><div class="txt-body text-right">(the tender breakdown price)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Actual sum</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+5,000</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">+5,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Final contract sum</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">13,000</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold">15,000</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">641 In a situation where there are no changes to the PC Rate or the quantities of the PC Rate item, one would expect as a matter of fairness that the contract sum should stay the same. Indeed, this is the result that is obtained under F+G’s method, as seen by the final contract sum emphasised in bold. In contrast, the defendant’s method of calculation would result in the final contract sum being <span class="font-italic">increased </span>from $13,000 to $15,000, despite the fact that no changes were actually made to the contract specifications. This illustrates how F+G’s method of calculation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, deducting the measured sum) will result in more accurate adjustments being made to the contract sum, allowing for fairer results. It will also result in greater certainty to the owner. This point was corroborated by Mr Ng as follows:

In contrast, Mr Ng was himself a pundit QS and testified that based on his knowledge and experience, his method of calculation is “common” whereas he had never come across the defendant’s method of calculation.

</div> In ascertaining the “value” of this work, it was appropriate for F+G to consider the value attributed to it in the architect’s instructions, checked against the invoice. Furthermore, the defendant’s case rests upon the assumption that before the Statement of Final Account is issued, the plaintiff must have made payment to all of its subcontractors in order for it to be able to provide proof of payment. However, this is not always the case. In fact, the plaintiff has yet to pay some of the NSCs pending the outcome of this trial.

</div> The NSCs or NSs would look to the plaintiff for payment and not the defendant. Therefore, it would not have made commercial sense for the parties to intend, by cll 31(11)(a) and 28(5), that the plaintiff be required to submit proof of payment. Thus, I find that it was appropriate for the plaintiff to have submitted the relevant invoices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">647 I observe that the defendant had made numerous progress payments to the plaintiff prior to IC25.

The defendant cannot simply allege that the plaintiff has failed to produce evidence rebutting the defendant’s allegations. As Mr Ng testified, these credit notes would only be relevant for the Statement of Final Account if they were given for the plaintiff to enjoy a discounted rate on the PC Rate items.

</div> In this light, Mr Tan’s evidence does little to support the defendant’s case. Even if it shows that concealment of discounts is a possibility, this does not meet the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities as required of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">Summary on the issuance of IC25 and IC26</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">652 In summary, I find that IC25 and IC26 were issued in accordance with the contractual terms. In relation to the questions raised by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Court of Appeal) </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the plaintiff and the third party provided sufficient and satisfactory explanations for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The release of the moiety of the retention sum of $328,250 under IC25 was accurately 50% of the total retention sum, as the total retention sum was $656,500 and not $644,195.65.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff had a backlog of progress payment claims, and this led to the delay in its submission of progressive PC 23 to PC 26 after the issuance of the CC. This, in turn, caused a delay in the issuance of IC25 and IC26. This provided the plaintiff a steady stream of claims for its finances.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The amounts certified under IC25 and IC26 were proper and correctly quantified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The works certified under IC25 and IC26 had been completed prior to the issuance of the CC although the progressive payment claims were submitted much later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">653 These findings are only possible because of the veritable wealth of evidence that was adduced before me, while the CA only had scanty affidavits containing limited evidence. This was a point repeatedly emphasized by the CA, in particular at [86] and [92] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">86 … The Respondent’s explanation for these figures is inconsistent with the evidence presented.

However, at this stage, based on what appears in IC 26 and its immediate underlying documents, there are serious irregularities and unexplained discrepancies that deprive IC 26 of any temporary finality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">654 Furthermore, the sums tabulated in the Summary were flummoxing and unnecessarily complex, which required extensive explanation, as seen from the following exchange:

In [<span class="font-italic">H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Chin Ivan</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1318] at [18], this court stipulated this as one of the requirements that confers temporary finality on the architect’s certificates in that his clarification, if requested, would set out the basis of <span class="font-italic">his</span> independent professional judgment.

</div>
</div> This constitutes an act of prevention which renders the liquidated damages clause inoperable against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">662 The principles surrounding the concept of an act of prevention are well-settled in Singapore and have been approved in many cases (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yap Boon Keng Sonny </span>([385] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd v LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 4 SLR 455; <span class="font-italic">Chua Tian Chu and another v Chin Bay Ching and another </span>[2011] SGHC 126 at [58]–[64]). An act of prevention is an event that “operates to prevent, impede or otherwise make it more difficult for a contractor to complete the works by the date stipulated in the contract” (see <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts</span> at para 9.155). The effect and rationale of an act of prevention are explained in <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts </span>at paras 9.156 and 9.157 as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.156 The legal consequence of an act of prevention is that the date for completion originally stipulated in the contract ceases to be the operating date for the completion of the works. In the absence of the adequate contractual provision for the adjustment of the completion date on account of the prevention, time is said to be set at large. This principle is considered to be an equitable remedy and has been attributed to the legal maxim that <span class="font-italic">no man shall take advantage of his own wrong</span>.

Such a result can be prevented by providing in the contractor for extensions of time in the event of the employer’s acts or omissions affecting the progress of works, and by the actual grant of extensions of time.

</div> This was also the rightful and new contractual completion date, taking into account the granting of EOT 2 and EOT 3. After this discovery, the third party, as the defendant’s agent and clothed with actual or apparent authority, instructed the plaintiff not to commence rectification works until after TOP Inspection 1, which took place on 30 April 2013.

</div>
</div> The delay of rectification works was, perhaps, because the third party considered the steps and risers as minor works that could be rectified after TOP Inspection 1. This prevented the plaintiff from completing the rectification works sooner. Although the SIA Conditions do contain provisions pertaining to the grant of EOT, no EOT was <span class="font-italic">actually </span>granted in respect of the third party’s direction to delay rectification works. Accordingly, the time for completion was set at large. I note that if the plaintiff had commenced rectification works immediately, it would probably have completed rectification works <span class="font-italic">after </span>the completion date of 17 April 2013. Therefore, it was likely to have been in delay regardless of the third party’s instruction. However, as explained in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts </span>above, this is immaterial. It is well-settled that an act of prevention renders the liquidated damages clause inoperable even if the contractor himself was also in delay. This is because the effect of the act of prevention is to set time at large. Therefore, even if the contractor is in delay, there is no completion date from which to calculate the liquidated damages due from the contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">665 For these reasons, the liquidated damages clause in the Contract is rendered inoperable. As such, the defendant cannot claim for liquidated damages against the plaintiff. The defendant also cannot claim general damages against the plaintiff as the third party, his agent, had issued the CC on 15 May 2013 to take effect on 17 April 2013. Thus, the plaintiff is not liable to the defendant for any damages, liquidated or otherwise, in respect of the premature issuance of the CC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Maintenance period</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">666 The premature issuance of the CC resulted in a cascading effect on the maintenance period. As explained above at [29], based on the CC that the third party issued, the maintenance period of the Project commenced on 18 April 2013 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the day after the certified completion date) and ended on 17 April 2014. Had the CC been properly issued on 28 May 2013, the maintenance period of the Project should rightly have commenced on 28 May 2013 and ended on 27 May 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">667 However, I disagree with the defendant that the premature issuance of the CC by the third party resulted in him being unable to get the plaintiff to rectify the defects. The third party issued the MC on 7 July 2014. The MC certified that the defects within the Project had been satisfactorily rectified and was properly issued, as stated below at [669]–[671]. Given that the MC was issued <span class="font-italic">after </span>the end of the original maintenance period (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 17 April 2014), it is clear that the third party was not limited by the maintenance period in deciding when to issue the MC.

</div>  I note that the defendant had, by this point in time (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 2014), embarked on his campaign against the plaintiff and the third party, going out of his way to fastidiously uncover minute defects with the help of BAPL. In such circumstances, particularly when the defendant was highly unreasonable and made extraordinary and hyperbolic demands, the third party was well-entitled to exercise its own independent judgment and conclude that the defects were satisfactorily rectified, and thereafter issue the MC. This led the defendant to suspect that the third party and the plaintiff were in a conspiracy to defraud him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">671 Furthermore, the third party formed its opinion that the defects had been properly rectified together with the other Consultants, strengthening the inference that the MC was properly issued. I, therefore, dismiss the defendant’s claims in relation to the MC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary on conspiracy claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">672 Having dealt with each of the individual issues, I now summarise my overall findings in relation to the defendant’s conspiracy claim.  The defendant claims that the conspiracy against him began at the start of the Project, from as early as March or April 2011, as mentioned at [104] above. In effect, his allegation of conspiracy tainted and seeped into each and every step of the construction process of the Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">673 However, having thoroughly analysed the contemporaneous evidence and having heard the testimonies of the witnesses, I find that the defendant’s conspiracy allegations hold no water. In particular, the following allegations made by the defendant in relation to the alleged conspiracy are utterly devoid of merit:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Beginning with the tender process, the defendant claims that the third party “pushed” for the plaintiff to be appointed over other contractors, making “life difficult” for the other contractors and asking them to “stay away”. However, the evidence shows that the entire tender process was conducted transparently, fairly and thoroughly, as explained above at [160]–[179].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant’s allegations that the various EOTs granted by the third party to the plaintiff were pre-determined are based on the defendant’s own erroneous imagination. There is simply no evidence to back up such spurious claims. All the parties involved in the processing of the EOTs acted with utmost professionalism and independence, as explained above at [180]–[295].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant alleges that the premature issuance of the CC gives rise to the inference of a conspiracy. I have found that the CC should only have been issued on 28 May 2013 after the completion of rectification works on the steps and risers which were raised in TOP Inspection 1 instead of on 15 May 2013 and taking effect on 17 April 2013. This was an error of judgment as the third party, at the material time, did not realise that Item 72 applied, or that Item 72(a) required him to consider whether the failure to obtain the TOP was due to any faults in the construction attributable to the plaintiff. I accept that this was an honest mistake.

</div> This oversight has nothing to do with any conspiracy to injure the defendant. Furthermore, Item 72(b) was satisfied by 17 April 2013 as the requisite T&amp;C had been conducted and the handover of the relevant documents requirement is <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> (see [336]–[382] above).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Although there were certain incomplete rectification works such as the trellis beams, intumescent paint, the screed in the swimming pool and the grouting of the swimming pool wall (summarised above at [383]–[576]) none of these show that there was a conspiracy to injure the defendant. The third party may have overlooked some issues, but it consistently acted in good faith, based on its experience, commercial understanding and practical reality, as explained above at [298]–[668].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The issuance of the MC by the third party was done fairly, rationally and in consultation with its team of professionals as explained above at [669]–[671]. There was no conspiracy to injure the defendant in relation to the issuance of the MC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The payment certificates were issued in accordance with the contractual terms, as explained above at [589]–[656].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">674 It seems that when the plaintiff sought to enforce its certified payment claims the defendant tried to avoid his own contractual liability by coming up with the conspiracy allegation. This underscores and aptly reflects the general findings I made earlier in this judgment, at [79]–[119] above, in relation to the conspiracy claim that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant had a propensity to recklessly make allegations and speculations based on his own suspicions. All of these were highly tenuous and unsupported by any evidence whatsoever, and in fact were based on his own “feelings”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant’s version of events was highly incredible. He alleged that he knew about the conspiracy from the very beginning but had chosen to remain silent. Despite such knowledge, he took no action, did not inform any of his hand-picked Assistants of such conspiracy, and did not make a police report or lodge a complaint to the respective professional bodies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant maintains a highly hyperbolic claim and takes an unreasonable position, refusing to mitigate any of his losses despite clear and reasonable opportunities for him to do so. He had the financial means to rectify the defects but refused to do so. He also insisted on absolute rectification of any type of defects, even those that were extremely minute in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">675 The defendant refused to call any of his hand-picked Assistants as witnesses to support his case. They would have been best placed to bolster his conspiracy allegations, if these were in fact true. His refusal to call any of them suggests that his allegations of conspiracy were likely fabricated and an afterthought, conceived after the plaintiff demanded for the last three outstanding payments. Furthermore, Mr Yong testified that throughout the entire construction of the Project, the plaintiff had not threatened, offered a reward, compensation or bribe to the third party to gain an advantage.

He then embarked on a campaign against them, utilising the generous financial resources at his disposal and enlisting the help of Mr Chin in an attempt to expose as many flaws as he could in the Project.

The law regarding when a duty of care arises is well-settled. In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”), the CA set out the two-stage test of proximity and policy considerations, preceded by the preliminary issue of factual foreseeability. The first stage of proximity includes physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, as well as the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance (see <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">681 In my view, the defendant’s case fails at both the first and second stages of proximity and policy considerations. The case of <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd and another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another appeal </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 300 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Bumi</span>”) is instructive. In that case, the CA found that no duty of care was owed by two subcontractors to a shipowner. In reaching this decision, the CA considered that the contract between the shipowner and the main contractor made the main contractor solely responsible for any defect that arose (see <span class="font-italic">PT Bumi </span>at [36]). Furthermore, it was the shipowner’s “deliberate choice that there was no direct contractual relationship” with the subcontractors (see <span class="font-italic">PT Bumi </span>at [38]). As such, the CA found that the shipowner had relied only on the main contractor, and not the two subcontractors; conversely, there had been no assumption of duty by the subcontractors <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the shipowner. In these circumstances, to “infer such a duty [of care] would run counter to the specific arrangement which [the shipowner] had chosen to make with [the main contractor]” (see <span class="font-italic">PT Bumi </span>at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">682 In this case, by refusing to sign the deed of novation, the defendant elected not to enter into a contractual relationship with the second third party (see [154] above). This was a deliberate choice, signifying the defendant’s lack of reliance on the second third party. For the same reason, it cannot be said that the second third party assumed any responsibility towards the defendant. Turning to the second stage, policy considerations similarly militate against the imposition of a duty of care. As in <span class="font-italic">PT Bumi</span>, imposing a duty of care would run counter to the contractual arrangement between the defendant, the first third party and the second third party. It would not be fair for the court to allow the defendant a backdoor remedy in tort for something he could not obtain in contract. Therefore, the defendant has no claim against the second third party in the tort of negligence, as no duty of care arises. I shall now consider whether the defendant has a case against the first third party.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The duty of supervision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">683 It is not disputed that the tortious duty of care owed by the first third party to the defendant includes a duty to supervise (see <span class="font-italic">Sim &amp; Associates v Tan Alfred </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim &amp; Associates</span>”)).

</div> this does not pertain to supervision. Rather, it is a separate issue which I shall consider below. Indeed, the fact that instructions were given by the third party to the plaintiff regarding the rectification of the steps and risers points towards there being supervision by the third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">693 For these reasons, I reject the defendant’s submission that the third party breached its duty of supervision, whether generally or specifically in relation to the steps and risers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The premature issuance of the CC and failure to issue a Delay Certificate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">694 As I have found above, the CC should have been issued on 28 May 2013.

He was not aware of Item 72 of the Preliminaries and therefore did not consider whether the requirements set out in Item 72 had been met.

</div> This fell below the standard of a reasonably competent architect. I note that cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions requires the architect to “certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract”. In order to be able to certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract, the architect must have read the terms of the Contract and must have been reasonably familiar with them. As such, the third party’s failure to do so constituted a breach of its duty of care, albeit that such a breach was not ill-intentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">695 As for the delay in obtaining the TOP, I find that the third party was not negligent for the failure of TOP Inspection 2 on 18 June 2013 and the eventual granting of the TOP on 16 September 2013. This is because the reasons for such failure did not arise from its breach of duty of care. Instead, as I have observed above, it arose from a difference in opinion between the third party and the BCA (see [330] and [333] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">696 I turn now to the damages for the third party’s negligence.

First, I note that the amount claimed is inaccurate and excessive, given that I have found that the CC should have been issued on 28 May 2013. Any claim in liquidated damages, therefore, should only run from 17 April 2013 to 28 May 2013. Secondly and more importantly, the claim for liquidated damages is one that should be made against the plaintiff, not the third party. The liquidated damages clause is contained in the Contract between the defendant and the plaintiff (specifically, cl 24(2) of the SIA Conditions), to which the third party is not a contracting party.

</div> In this regard, Lee Seiu Kin J’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Store+Deliver+Logistics Pte Ltd v Chin Siew Gim (trading as S G Chin and Associates) </span>[2012] SGHC 89 at [26] are apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Furthermore, the [liquidated damages] clause is contained in the Building Contract between the plaintiff [owner] and [the contractor]; the parties to that agreement agreed that damages of $2,500 is a pre-estimate of the losses that the plaintiff would suffer as a result of each day of delay in completion. It was not part of the Contract between the plaintiff and the defendant [the architect]. Therefore even if the plaintiff had suffered losses arising from the delayed completion which can be attributed to the defendant, the plaintiff cannot claim this in the form of [liquidated damages] but must prove actual losses it had incurred as a result of the delay. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">698 Furthermore, cl 31(1) of the SIA Conditions stipulates that all of the certificates issued by the third party have only “temporary finality”. Thus, it is open to the court hearing the substantive proceedings to “open up and revise” these certificates “with a view to the final resolution of the dispute” and the parties’ rights <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>each other (see the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan </span>([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [33]). In this respect, I have disallowed the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for liquidated damages at [665] above. It is therefore not open to the defendant to claim for liquidated damages against the third party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">699 Thirdly, the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PPG Industries (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Compact Metal Industries Ltd </span>[2013] SGCA 23 relied upon by the defendant can be distinguished as the facts are vastly different. In that case, the CA upheld the High Court’s decision that the respondent was entitled to claim from the appellant liquidated damages that were paid to the main contractor by the respondent’s subsidiary as a result of the appellant’s breach of contract. The CA explained at [19] that the subsidiary’s liability for liquidated damages constituted “ordinary damage” falling within the first limb of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Hadley v Baxendale </span>(1854) 165 ER 145. Therefore, the respondent could claim damages for such loss. It is notable that in that case, the respondent had <span class="font-italic">already incurred the liquidated damages and made payment for the same </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Compact Metal </span>at [12]). This is vastly different from the present case, where the defendant is claiming for a hypothetical sum of liquidated damages which he claims he was <span class="font-italic">deprived the opportunity of claiming</span>. I have explained that in this case the defendant cannot claim liquidated damages from the plaintiff. Therefore, I find <span class="font-italic">Compact Metal </span>to be inapplicable to this present case.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">700  Hence, the defendant is limited to general damages in respect of the third party’s negligence in issuing the CC prematurely. However, the defendant has not adduced any evidence to quantify his loss. In the course of the proceedings, the defendant stated that he was no longer pursuing a claim in loss of rental income and I rejected his subsequent attempt to re-introduce this head of claim. In so far as the defendant claims that the delay in obtaining TOP was due to the third party’s breach in its design duties, this is a separate issue which I shall address at [703] below. The defendant has neither pleaded nor adduced evidence showing any other losses he might have suffered by the third party’s premature issuance of the CC. Accordingly, the court can only award nominal damages of $1,000 to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">701 In respect of the third party’s decision to instruct the plaintiff to hold off on rectifying the steps and risers until after TOP Inspection 1, I have already explained that this constituted an act of prevention, such that the defendant can no longer claim for liquidated damages against the plaintiff. In light of this, the argument could be made that the third party was negligent in issuing such instructions, thereby costing the defendant the opportunity to claim liquidated damages against the plaintiff. However, this argument was not raised by the defendant in the pleadings or the submissions. The defendant has also not established whether the third party was negligent in issuing such instructions. The third party’s instructions to the plaintiff to delay rectification works was only raised by the defendant in relation to the third party’s alleged breach of its duty to supervise the Project,

</div> This would have been sufficient to dismiss the defendant’s claim, notwithstanding my further finding that the third party was not in fact negligent in designing the pavilion at Unit 12A. Secondly, I also reiterate that in relation to the premature issuance of the CC, I do not find that there was any improper motive underlying this. Rather, I accept the third party’s explanation that it was an honest mistake. Therefore, as regards the defendant’s claim at [702(e)] above, I find that the third party’s premature issuance of the CC does not support the inference that it was not acting impartially. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">704 I turn now to the defendant’s claim at [702(g)] above in respect of the timber decking. The defendant alleges that the timber decking was not constructed in accordance with the contract drawings. While the contract drawings stipulated that the timber strips were to be removable, they were eventually affixed to the supporting structure of the Project.

Secondly, pursuant to cl 2.2(n) of the MOA, 2% of the Architect’s Fees became payable when the Project obtained the CSC.

This is further underscored by cl 1.3(2) of the MOA that states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All fees or charges due to the Architect shall not be reduced or withheld on <span class="font-italic">account of any dispute or question whatsoever</span> between the Client and the Building Contract or any other party. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">715 Similarly, the CSC for the Project was obtained on 12 May 2014, as explained above at [64].

Therefore, in addition to the payment of the above sums, I find that the third party is also entitled to interest on those sums as a result of the defendant’s failure to issue payment.

The defendant avers that he incurred $726,516.00 in defending against the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment, the subsequent appeals and related interlocutory applications. He further avers that as he only managed to recover $77,433.37 in legal costs from the plaintiff, the third party should be liable to compensate him for the outstanding costs he had incurred, amounting to the sum of $649,082.63. The defendant claims this on the basis that such costs had been incurred as “a consequence of the [third party’s] issuance of these irregular and/or invalid certificates”.

</div> It is not clear whether the work reflected in these invoices had been undertaken for the purpose of the summary judgment application because no breakdown was provided by the defendant. When asked about this, the defendant insisted that based on his memory, his solicitors had only undertaken work in relation to the summary judgment application. However, he himself acknowledged that his memory might not be accurate, as follows:

This period was <span class="font-italic">after </span>the summary judgment application was heard by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ser Kim Koi (Court of Appeal) </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). That suggests that the work reflected in these invoices could not have been done for the purposes of the summary judgment application. For these reasons, I find that the evidence adduced by the defendant is sorely lacking and unreliable in showing exactly how much he actually spent in relation to the summary judgment application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">723 More fundamentally, it should be noted that the summary judgment application was between the plaintiff and the defendant, as explained above at [65]–[68]. The third party was not a party to the proceedings in the summary judgment application. Its only involvement there was the filing of a brief affidavit in support of the plaintiff’s application. As a non-party, the starting point here is clear: any costs arising out of the summary judgment application should not be borne by the third party. It is a matter that has to be resolved as between the plaintiff and the defendant. Furthermore, the application for summary judgment by the plaintiff related to IC25, IC26 and FC, which were properly issued by the third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">724 The only possible legal leg upon which this claim for expenses against the third party can possibly stand is if the third party had actually conspired against the defendant. However, as established above at [70]–[675], there is no evidence of any conspiracy in this case. Accordingly, the defendant’s claim against the third party for legal expenses incurred in the summary judgment application must fail.

Order 20 r 5(1) reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule, the Court may <span class="font-italic">at any stage of the proceedings </span>allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, <span class="font-italic">on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">113 The guiding principle is that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">amendments to pleadings ought to be allowed if they would enable the real question and/or issue in controversy between the parties to be determined</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 640 (‘<span class="font-italic">Wright Norman</span>’) at [6], [<span class="font-italic">Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [102], [<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum Pte Ltd v Lon</span><span class="font-italic">g Ai Sin </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 173]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10] and <span class="font-italic">Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd </span>[1987] AC 189 (‘<span class="font-italic">Ketteman</span>’) at 212; see also [<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2007 </span>(G P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)] at para 20/8/8 and [<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2006 </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2006)] at para 20/5/3). However, an important caveat to granting leave for the amendment of pleadings is that it must be just to grant such leave, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Thus, this court held in <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>that the court, in determining whether to grant a party leave to amend his pleadings, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must have regard to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">‘the justice of the case’</span> (at [12]) and must bear in mind (at least) two key factors, namely, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether the amendments would cause any prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated in costs</span> and whether the party applying for leave to amend is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">‘</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">effectively asking for a second bite at the cherry’</span> (at [18]). These two key factors were endorsed recently again by this court in [<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> v American Express Bank Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 737]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [58].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[CA’s emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span> in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">733 In my view, this application was made very late into the trial. The first tranche of the trial was from 8 November to 30 November 2018 and the second tranche was from 16 January to 31 January 2019. This application was made after the commencement of the third tranche of the trial and after the defendant had been extensively cross-examined by the plaintiff’s and the third party’s respective counsel. It seems that this application was an attempt to salvage the defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff, which I shall elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">734 The original F&amp;BP regarding the claim for loss of rental income and liquidated damages was similar to the defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim on his claim against the plaintiff for the plaintiff’s delay in the Project. No attempts were made to amend this aspect of the pleadings since the original Defence and Counterclaim was first filed in February 2014. Subsequently, three amendments were made to the Defence and Counterclaim. The latest was in October 2018. None of the amendments to the counterclaim related to the substance of the application. Hence, there had been no attempts to amend the pleadings on the defendant’s claim for loss of rental income and liquidated damages until now<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>more than six years later).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">735 In relation to the F&amp;BP, which was lodged on 9 March 2018, the defendant’s answers significantly mirror the Defence and Counterclaim regarding his claim for loss of rental income and liquidated damages. No amendments were made to the F&amp;BP for about two years. I am cognisant that delay <span class="font-italic">per se </span>does not equate to injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing </span>at [114]–[115]; <span class="font-italic">Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd </span>[1987] AC 189 at 212). In this case, however, it is undeniable that there was inordinate delay. This application arose because of damaging evidence given by the defendant in court when the plaintiff’s and the third party’s respective counsel cross-examined him. The amendments sought were effectively an attempt to get a second bite of the very same cherry that the defendant had earlier given up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">736 This can be seen from how, under the amendments, the defendant attempted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to introduce a claim for loss of rental income as an alternative to liquidated damages.

It is clear that he is now only claiming for liquidated damages. Therefore, it was not open to the defendant’s counsel to subsequently seek to retract from that position through an amendment to the pleadings that was at odds with what the defendant himself had previously stated in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">739 The defendant’s counsel, initially, submitted that in re-examination the defendant had clarified that he was seeking the loss of rental income as an alternative claim. The third party’s counsel challenged his recollection and the defendant’s counsel sought an adjournment to check. This was granted. After the lunch adjournment the defendant’s counsel conceded that he had erred and that he did not re-examine the defendant about the loss of rental income. Thus, on record, the defendant clearly stated in court that he did not wish to claim for the loss of rental income and he is only claiming for liquidated damages. Accordingly, the defendant’s counsel indicated that he was not pursuing the amendment regarding the loss of rental income and that he would remove all references to the loss of rental income in the application. However, the defendant continued to pursue the other aspects of its application to amend his F&amp;BP, in particular, amendments that related to the duration of the liquidated damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">740 For this remaining aspect of the amendments, the defendant sought to extend the time period relevant to the calculation of the claim for liquidated damages. As seen from the quote in [736], the period for the defendant’s original claim for liquidated damages was from 22 February 2013 to 21 July 2014 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> from the contractual completion date to the handover date, a total of 515 days).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">741 The defendant sought to amend the relevant dates, such that the claim for liquidated damages spanned from the contractual completion date (22 February 2013) to <span class="font-italic">today</span>.

Therefore, as at today GTMS is at least liable to pay liquidated damages <span class="font-underline">and in the alternative loss of rent</span> for <span class="font-underline">2,558</span> 515 days’ delay from the contractual completion date to <span class="font-underline">today</span> the Handover Date i.e. from 22 February 2013 to <span class="font-underline">today</span> 21 July 2014.

In effect, it multiplied the duration for which liquidated damages were being sought by almost five times, from 515 days to 2558 days and counting. Notwithstanding this drastic disparity, the defendant argued that this would be consistent with the initial pleadings. In particular, he relied on the following paragraph of the Defence and Counterclaim:

The defendant’s pleadings and the F&amp;BP have to be considered in the context of his claim. Considering the entire paragraph quoted above at [742] in full, it is clear that the period for which liquidated damages were being claimed was specifically identified (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from the contractual completion date of 22 February 2013 to the handover date of 21 July 2014). To ensure that there was no misunderstanding regarding the period of liquidated damages the defendant’s pleadings further indicated that this was for a total period of 515 days. This period of liquidated damages was consistently prescribed in the initial pleadings as well as the amended pleadings. There was simply no ambiguity or room for a contrary interpretation in this regard. This is emphasized and made even clearer beyond all doubt in a subsequent answer provided in the F&amp;BP:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Please state if these claims for losses and damages due to late completion overlap with the claims for liquidated damages by the Defendant in the D&amp;CC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Answer: No it does not overlap. SKK is claiming for liquidated damages <span class="font-underline">and in the alternative loss of rent</span> from the contractual completion date (i.e. 22 February 2013) to the Handover Date (i.e. 21 July 2014). SKK is claiming for loss of rental from the date after the Handover Date until to date.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">745 Therefore, there were two distinct periods of time in the defendant’s claim for liquidated damages and loss of rental income which he was now not pursuing. The first was for liquidated damages for the period beginning on the completion date and ending on the handover date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 22 February 2013 to 21 July 2014). The second was for the loss of rental income from the handover date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>21 July 2014) to today. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">746 What the term “at least” referred to (see [742] above) was not the <span class="font-italic">duration or</span> <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of the claim as now alleged by the defendant, but rather the <span class="font-italic">type or nature </span>of claim that could be brought. For instance, the defendant is claiming other types of damages such as additional utility charges incurred arising from the delay. It would be a significant change to the defendant’s claim for liquidated damages if the court had allowed the amendments proposed in SUM 871/2020. The trial had not only started but the plaintiff had testified and closed its case. This application, if granted, would have been a grave injustice, grossly unfair and highly prejudicial to the plaintiff. To the extent that the defendant is also seeking to make the third party liable for any liquidated damages the plaintiff is liable to pay the defendant, the third party would also be prejudiced. It is evident that the amendments were the consequence of the defendant’s testimony in court when he said that he did not wish to claim for the loss of rental income. If the period for which liquidated damages are being claimed is limited to 515 days, this will reduce his claim significantly. This explained the motive behind the amendments proposed in SUM 871/2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">747 Accordingly, I dismissed the application in SUM 871/2020. On the issue of costs, under the Costs Guidelines in Appendix G, an application for the amendment of pleadings is in the range of $1,000 to $6,000. The plaintiff sought costs of $5,000 while the third party asked for $3,500. The defendant proposed costs of $1,000. I ordered the defendant to pay the costs of SUM 871/2020 to the plaintiff and the third party fixed at $2,000 each, inclusive of disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">748 Despite the dismissal of SUM 871/2020, the defendant continued to pursue and make submissions that he is claiming from the plaintiff and/or the third party liquidated damages up till today instead of the handover date, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 21 July 2014.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">749 For the above reasons, I issue the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant, I allow the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for the sums due under TI25, TI26 and TI27, amounting to $1,103,915.48 in total.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff that there was a conspiracy between the plaintiff and the third party to injure the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for liquidated damages of $3,600 per calendar day of delay from 21 February 2013 (the original contractual completion date) to present.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the loss of rental income due to the delay by the plaintiff in the completion of the Project.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the dented/punctured gas pipe.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the alleged cracks, tonality, stains and other forms of impurities in the Volakas marble flooring.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the alleged cracks, splinters, stains and differences in tonality in the ironwood at the timber decking.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the alleged variance in tonality of the Indian rosewood timber floor finish and other defects.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the alleged defects in relation to the aluminium cappings at the rooftop.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ix) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for damages in relation to the steps and risers, which were in compliance with the statutory requirements as of 28 May 2013.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(x) I dismiss the defendant’s claim against the plaintiff for the costs of rectifying the alleged leakage in the swimming pools.
