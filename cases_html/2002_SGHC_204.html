        The accused person was charged that he </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  day of June 2001, between 10.00 p.m. and 12.00 midnight, at a vacant plot of land off

  Pioneer Road North, Singapore, together with one Thongthot Yordsa-Art, one Dornchinnamat

  Yingyos, one Uthorn Koedsomboon and 2 other unknown males, were members of an unlawful

  assembly whose common object was to cause grievous hurt to one Saenphan Thawan (male/23

  years), and while (he was) a member of the said assembly, one or more members thereof, in

  the prosecution of the common object of that assembly, did commit murder by causing the

  death of the said Saenphan Thawan, an offence which (he) knew to be likely to be committed

  in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly, and (he has) thereby by virtue of

  section 149 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, committed an offence punishable under section

  302 of the Penal Code</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        A substantial portion of the facts presented by

the prosecution was not disputed by the accused.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        On the day of the offence the accused and a

group of Thai nationals met at a forested area off Jalan Bahar where they had beer and

liquor and talked. Thongthot Yordsa-Art (who is also known as "Thot"), told them

that the deceased threatened his girlfriend, and he wanted to teach the deceased a lesson.

They talked of assaulting the deceased. One member of the group remembered that the

accused had said "Let’s just kill him" and the accused admitted that he

proposed that they hit him hard, and break his arm or leg.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        After talking and drinking the accused and five

persons from the group left Jalan Bahar and went to Kim Tian Road where they expected to

find the deceased. They took lethal weapons with them including knives and swords. The

accused carried an iron chain with an iron block, and he changed that for a sword when

they arrived at their destination.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        When they found and confronted the deceased, a

fight ensued. The deceased fled after he was struck with a sword. They chased him and

caught up with him and assaulted him further when he fell. The accused struck the

deceased’s back with his sword. The deceased died from injuries inflicted by members

of the group.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        The accused’s defence was that he was

obliged to Thot for having helped him before, and had participated in the assault out of

fear that Thot would harm him if he did not join him and the others that day. Another line

of defence was that he was under the influence of alcohol and did not know that murder was

likely to be committed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        Neither defences are made out. There was no

evidence of fear of immediate harm necessary to support a defence of duress under section

94 of the Penal Code.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The defence of intoxication failed because he

must have known from the group’s discussions and the weapons that were brought, it

was the group’s common intention to cause grievous hurt to the deceased.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        Counsel in the submissions confirmed that the

accused did not deny that he was a member of an unlawful assembly which common object was

to cause hurt to the deceased, and that a member of the unlawful assembly murdered the

deceased.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        The defence was that he was too drunk to know

that murder was likely to be committed.<sup>2</sup> This was inconsistent with his own

evidence that he was with the others when they talked about assaulting the deceased and

when the deceased was confronted, assaulted and pursued, and by his own admission that he

struck him with his sword after he had fallen. Nothing in his own account of the events

suggested that he did not know that murder was likely to be committed that day. To the

contrary, I found that he must have known that it was likely that the deceased would be

killed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        In the circumstances, I convicted the accused

and imposed the mandatory death penalty on him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        The accused has stated that he did not wish to

appeal against the decision and has not filed an appeal.</font></p>
