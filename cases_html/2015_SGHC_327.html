<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants sought in Summons No 3443 of 2015
                    a stay of proceedings in Singapore commenced by the Plaintiff on the basis that
                    the People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”) was the more
                    appropriate forum, or alternatively, that all proceedings be stayed pending the
                    disposal of the PRC proceedings. I declined the application, but granted the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendants’ application for leave to appeal in Summons No 5042 of
                    2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In February 2015, the Plaintiff began an action
                    for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    against the Defendants. Sino-Add (Singapore) Pte Ltd, the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, and Sino-Trust Shipping Pte Ltd,
                    the 4<sup>th</sup> Defendant, were each owned by the Plaintiff,
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant, in the proportion 25:65:10 respectively. The three of them actually
                    owned 12 companies in Singapore, Hong Kong, the PRC and the British Virgin
                    Islands in the same manner. This group was on occasion referred to by some of
                    the parties as “the Sino-Trust Group”. The group was not however a
                    corporate group, as there were no cross-shareholdings among the companies. What
                    was common, however, was shareholding by these three persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       While the Plaintiff, on the one hand, and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants
                    initially had at least a working relationship, if not a good one, the
                    relationship between them broke down towards the second quarter of 2014. The
                    Plaintiff thus launched his minority oppression action seeking a buy out or
                    alternatively, the winding up of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff applied for leave to serve the
                    cause papers out of jurisdiction in March 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the meantime, there were two proceedings
                    commenced by Sino-Trust Corporation against the Plaintiff, alleging
                    misappropriation of corporate funds by the Plaintiff, and the other his unlawful
                    possession of original financial documents belonging to companies that are part
                    of the “Sino-Trust Group”. Judgment was given in the latter
                    proceedings by a Dalian first instance court which ruled <em>inter alia</em> that: (a) the actual place of business of the all the
                    companies in the group was at the office of Sino-Trust Corporation in Dalian;
                    (b) Sino-Trust was responsible for the management and operation of all the other
                    companies; (c) Sino-Trust had the power to maintain all the financial documents
                    of the other companies; (d) the financial documents held by the Plaintiff were
                    the assets of the companies; and (e) there was nothing to show that the
                    Plaintiff went through the proper process to obtain the documents. The
                    proceedings on misappropriation were not complete by the time of the hearing
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendant’s Arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Defendant argued for a stay to be granted
                    under the principles in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v
                        Cansulex</em> [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). The following factors relevant to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test pointed to the PRC: the residence and place of
                    business of the parties, the location of the events; witnesses would be resident
                    in the PRC; witnesses would likely have limited English skills; the Shareholders
                    Agreements governing the relationship between the Plaintiff, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants
                    were made in the PRC and were in Chinese; other proceedings in the Dalian would
                    have a material effect on the claim of oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As for the second stage, the Shareholders
                    Agreements, drafted by the Plaintiff himself, specified limits and mechanisms
                    for the exit of the shareholders. The fact that the Plaintiff would not be able
                    to get the same cause of action or relief in the PRC does not mean he could not
                    obtain justice in the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       An expert opinion confirmed that in respect of
                    the remedies claimed by the Plaintiff in Singapore, he could obtain the same or
                    similar remedies such as a buy out or winding up. A PRC court would also
                    conclude that Singapore law applies, but even if it were determined that PRC
                    Company Law applied, there are similar reliefs available. The plaintiff would
                    not be deprived of any real juridical advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In applying the two-stage test in <em>Spiliada</em>, the fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate
                    personal or juridical advantage in proceedings in Singapore is not
                    decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was contended firstly that the primary
                    factors to be considered in the present case was the applicable law to the
                    dispute and the nature of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It could not be shown in respect of a minority
                    oppression action that another forum is competent to resolve the dispute and is
                    clearly the more appropriate forum as such a minority oppression action is based
                    on a Singapore statute giving specific rights to shareholders, and the company
                    is a Singapore company subject to that statute: <em>Transtech
                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry and Ors</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 1014
                        (“<em>Transtech</em>”). A similar
                    position was reached in <em>Re Nasbulk</em> BVIHCM (COM)
                    65/2012 at first instance in the British Virgin Islands (“<em>Nasbulk</em>”). The East Caribbean Court of Appeal
                    (“ECCA”) in <em>Nasbulk</em> at the appeal
                    stage, <em>Nanjing Ocean (BVI) Co Ltd v Gao Chunhe and
                        anor</em> BVIHCAP 2013/0005 (“<em>Nanjing
                        Ocean</em>”) reached a different conclusion but should not be
                    followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In contrast to Singapore, the PRC is not the
                    more appropriate forum. The Shareholders Agreements were not the basis of the
                    claim, and thus the governing law, the choice of court and the language and
                    execution of the Shareholders Agreements were irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     No equivalent provision to s 216 is available
                    under the PRC Company Law. It is telling that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants previously took the position that
                    withdrawal from the group had no basis in the Shareholders
                Agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Contrary to the contentions of the
                    Defendant’s expert, the Plaintiff's expert gave the opinion that there was
                    no power for the court to order that the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> Defendants assume any liabilities or to order
                    the winding up of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> Defendants. The place of the actual
                    oppression was not disputed, and would at most be a neutral
                factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There being not a single group, there was no
                    justification to treat them as a single entity. The companies operated
                    independently. The location of witnesses was not crucial, and in any event the
                    geographical location of witnesses is not determinative. The location of
                    documents was also not a strong factor pointing to the PRC. The Dalian
                    proceedings were distinct, and different from the Singapore proceedings. Even if
                    there is a risk of conflicting judgments that is not determinative: <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and anor v Nicolai Baron von
                        Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR (R) 377 (“<em>Rickshaw</em>”) at [90].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Even if the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test pointed to the PRC,
                    justice required that a stay be denied. The Plaintiff would be unable to pursue
                    a minority oppression or equivalent action in the PRC, and would not be able to
                    obtain either winding up or a buy-out by the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I declined to order the stay sought by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendants. The fact that the Plaintiff was invoking a statutory action in
                    respect of a dispute within a Singapore company was an important consideration.
                    This matrix supplied factors that went to both the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> stages of
                    the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The fact that the claim was in respect of a
                    shareholders’ dispute within a Singapore-incorporated company was an
                    important connecting factor that, coupled with the specific claim of a minority
                    oppression action under the Companies Act outweighs any other connecting factor
                    pointing to the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Even if I was wrong on the analysis for the
                    first stage, at the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage analysis, the question
                    of the specific remedy or juridical advantage available to the plaintiffs would
                    not be available to him in the PRC and it would cause injustice for him to be
                    deprived of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I should note that the Defendants did not seek
                    to set aside the Plaintiff’s service out of the jurisdiction on the basis
                    that Singapore was not the appropriate forum. There would be a difference in
                    burden in respect of a challenge to service out under Order 11 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) as the Plaintiff would have had to show that
                    Singapore was the more appropriate forum, with the Defendants then showing that
                    it would be unjust to allow service out: <em>Siemens AG v
                        Holdrich Investment Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1007. In the end though,
                    nothing turned on this as I was satisfied that in any case Singapore was the
                    appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The principles enunciated in <em>Spiliada</em> have been applied on many occasions locally. In
                    essence, on a stay application, at the 1<sup>st</sup> stage, the
                    Defendants here would have the burden of showing that the PRC is a more
                    appropriate forum. Thereafter, at the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of
                    the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the Plaintiff would have to
                    show that it would be unjust to send him to that forum. There appears to be
                    readiness to conflate the two stages into one, namely, whether it is shown that
                    Singapore is the appropriate forum: see <em>VTB Capital Plc v
                        Nitrite International Corp</em> [2012] EWCA Civ 808. It may be that
                    there is much to commend a single stage analysis, but I am bound by the
                    two-stage approach laid down in <em>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling
                        Corp and anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia and anor appeal</em>
                    [1992] 2 SLR (R) 345 and similar cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1<sup>st</sup> Stage of the Spiliada
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Singapore was the more appropriate forum in
                    view of the nature of the claim made by the Plaintiff; factors which pointed to
                    the PRC were either neutral or of relatively little weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In considering this issue, the legal character
                    of the claim asserted by Plaintiff was to be differentiated from the existence
                    or otherwise of a juridical or legitimate advantage. What this meant was that
                    the nature of the dispute raised by the Plaintiff had be analysed in terms of
                    its legal basis, the evidence that would be required, the applicable law, and
                    the relevant parties with standing to defend or which would be affected in legal
                    terms by the determination of the issue. These factors were distinct from those
                    that would go to the question whether there was a juridical or legitimate
                    advantage and if so, whether it would be just to deprive the plaintiff of
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The nature of the claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The claim made by the Plaintiff was for
                    minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act. That provision permitted,
                    among others, a shareholder to apply to the court for an order on the basis that
                    the affairs of the company or the powers of the directors are being exercised in
                    an oppressive manner, or that some act of the company has been done or
                    threatened which unfairly discriminates. The court may then make various orders
                    including prohibiting the act or cancelling a transaction, authorising civil
                    proceedings to be brought in the name of the company, order compulsory purchase
                    of shares, or the winding-up of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Aside from the specific remedies, which are
                    potentially relevant in the analysis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage
                    of the <em>Spiliada</em> analysis, a claim under s 216 is
                    primarily a claim made by a shareholder in respect of his interest in a
                    Singapore company, concerning allegations in the activity of that company or the
                    decisions of the board of directors of that company. The records, including
                    those that may need to be statutorily filed, would be in Singapore or should at
                    least be accessible in Singapore. The law governing the affairs of the company
                    and the obligations owed by the company, the general duties of the directors and
                    the general obligations of the majority to the minority would be governed by
                    Singapore law. The centre of gravity of such a claim would be in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is against this framework that I understand
                        <em>Transtech</em> to be decided. The case was cited by
                    the Plaintiff for the proposition that the existence of the statutory action
                    indicated that Singapore was the more appropriate forum. What to my mind
                    mattered was not so much that the action was statutory – in many systems
                    of law most if not all rights are statutory in some way – but rather that
                    the forum’s domestic laws had prescribed a framework for assertion of
                    rights in a particular factual scenario, giving legal rights and imposing legal
                    obligations to the various participants in that scenario. Where the scenario
                    pertains, the predisposition would be to regard the forum as the natural forum,
                    and that other <em>fori</em> would be inappropriate. In
                        <em>Transtech</em>, Prakash J stated, at [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Counsel’s] difficulty was, of course, that in order to
                        obtain a stay on the basis of <em>forum non
                            conveniens</em>, the applicant must show that there is another
                        forum which is competent to resolve the dispute and which is clearly the
                        more appropriate forum for its resolution. The defendants here could not
                        show that because the action in Singapore is based on a Singapore statute
                        which gives certain rights to an allegedly oppressed minority shareholder
                        and the company in which such oppressive activity is alleged to have taken
                        place is a Singapore company subject to that statute. Further, the
                        defendants in the Singapore action were sued in their capacity as directors
                        of the company and for actions undertaken in such capacity relating to the
                        handling of various business transactions and moneys on behalf of the
                        company and in the course of this business. Even if they could be sued in
                        such a capacity for such actions and for the same relief in New York (a
                        matter on which no submission was made by the defendants), the New York
                        court would not be the most appropriate one to resolve a dispute which
                        involved the meaning and scope of a Singapore statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is evident that the concern was with the rights conferred on
                    the claimant, and the obligations imposed on the other parties. All of these
                    pointed to Singapore and were the more important factors in that
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I did not think that the decision of the ECCA
                    in <em>Nanjing Ocean</em> was necessarily an authority
                    against the approach I took. In the first instance decision in <em>Nasbulk</em>, Bannister J concluded that the invoking of a
                    statutory remedy precluded any argument that the British Virgin Islands were the
                    more inappropriate forum, in the face of other factors pointing elsewhere,
                    including the PRC. Because of that statutory remedy, Banister J considered that
                    the case before him was not amenable to <em>Spiliada</em>
                    analysis, despite the presence of factors which the judge found pointing to the
                    PRC. However, the decision was reversed on appeal, with the ECCA finding that
                    the PRC was the natural forum there. The ECCA differed from Bannister J,
                    applying <em>Spiliada</em> fully, and agreed with his
                    earlier conclusion that the PRC was the more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Where I have differed from the ECCA is in
                    terms of the weighing of the various factors; I would note only, with respect,
                    that the ECCA did not seem to have considered the invoking of a statutory claim
                    as containing factors which need to be weighed against the factors pointing to
                    the PRC. I would differ with the ECCA on that score. I have not taken the
                    precise position of Bannister J that s 216 precluded the operation of <em>Spiliada</em> principles. Rather, as I have noted above, the
                    nature of the claim carries with it several factors that needed to be weighed
                    against those on the other side.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the same reason, there is also no conflict
                    in principle between my approach and the decision of <em>In re
                        Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd</em> [1992] Ch 72 (“<em>Harrods</em>”) in the English Court of Appeal which
                    applied <em>Spiliada</em> principles. Where there was a
                    difference was in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage, which I
                    will deal with below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Against the weight of these factors pointing
                    to Singapore as the more appropriate forum in a s 216 action, the following
                    factors identified by the Defendants could not cumulatively show that the PRC
                    was the more appropriate forum: (a) the Shareholders Agreements; (b) the nature
                    of the witnesses; (c) the structure of the group; and (d) the PRC
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Shareholders Agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Shareholders Agreements may govern the
                    position of the shareholders, and may in principle be relevant in action for
                    minority oppression. But in any action for minority oppression, it is
                    conceivable that a shareholder agreement would be just one of several sources of
                    evidence. Oral discussions for instance, and the conduct of parties may be
                    material as well. The existence of the Shareholders Agreements could not thus be
                    determinative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Structure of the Group</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Defendants referred to the companies in
                    question as being part of a group. However, as pointed out by the Plaintiff, the
                    companies are not in a formal structure. The Defendants nonetheless maintained
                    that the companies were really a single economic entity. Arguments that groups
                    of companies should be treated as single entity are made occasionally, to allow
                    the separate corporate identities of different companies to be disregarded,
                    especially when the shareholdings are held ultimately held by an individual or
                    group of individuals. Where the separation of identities is used to camouflage
                    fraudulent dealings by the common or ultimate shareholders, the courts would be
                    justified in disregarding the different companies created, which are essentially
                    interposed for ill-ends. However, it sits oddly for the controlling shareholder
                    to establish companies to handle his various businesses, make use of the
                    separate corporate identity, and then ask the court to disregard corporate
                    structures whenever it suits him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     So it is in the present case, with the
                    Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendants having direct shareholdings in each company. There being no direct
                    corporate relationship between the different companies, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants
                    cannot in these proceedings ask the court to disregard the separate identities
                    of the companies, even if it is true that they treated the companies as a single
                    undivided whole. They cannot invoke that argument simply because that doctrine
                    should only available against those who have used the corporate identity as a
                    façade to hide or disguise dealings; they were after all in the majority, and
                    cannot claim any equivalent sham by a minority shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants argued that most witnesses would
                    be in the PRC, and conversant primarily in Mandarin. Against that, the Plaintiff
                    argued that it was likely that the presence of witnesses would not be crucial. I
                    was of the view that even if witnesses from the PRC were needed, this could be
                    easily addressed in various ways. Singapore courts are used to having foreign
                    witnesses testifying in languages other than English; where necessary such
                    witnesses can testify from overseas: <em>Peter Roger May v Pinder
                        Lillian Gek Lian</em> [2006] 2 SLR (R) 381. The location of documents
                    is even less of an issue in cases generally: <em>John Reginald
                        Stott Kirkham and Ors v Trane US Inc and Ors</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R)
                    428.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proceedings in the PRC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for the PRC proceedings, I do not find that
                    either would be controlling or even largely relevant to the present proceedings.
                    The proceedings there were concerned with the alleged misappropriation of funds
                    by the Plaintiff and the retention of documents by him. The question of
                    retention of documents was not likely to be material to an oppression action in
                    Singapore or <em>vice versa</em>. As for the
                    misappropriation of funds, there is the possibility that there may be some
                    overlap in allegations, but just as possibly, there may not. Additionally, the
                    parties in the PRC proceedings are not the same as those involve Sino-Trust
                    Corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In any event, as argued by the Plaintiff, even
                    if an overlap arose, that would not be conclusive. In <em>Rickshaw</em>, the Court of Appeal noted at [90]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The danger of conflicting judgments must be weighed against the
                        other factors in the <em>Spiliada</em> enquiry and we
                        have seen that, hitherto, the various factors point towards Singapore as
                        being the most appropriate forum to hear the case. The relevant factors,
                        when considered in their totality, strongly militate against any suggestion
                        that the German courts would be “clearly more appropriate”
                        than the Singapore courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus, conflicting judgments would just be one factor to be weighed
                    against the others. In the present case, the possibility of conflicting
                    judgments on misappropriation of funds, retention of documents and minority
                    oppression did not seem significant; and even if there were any such conflict,
                    it would not outweigh the significant pointer to Singapore inherent in the
                    nature of the Plaintiff’s claim of minority oppression in a Singapore
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Differences in Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Additionally, I note the evidence of the
                    Plaintiff’s expert, which I prefer to that of the Defendant’s. The
                    Defendant’s expert took the position that the difference with Singapore
                    law was not significant. It may be that at this 1<sup>st</sup>
                    stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the fact that the laws
                    of competing <em>fori</em> may not be significantly
                    different would render this factor neutral or of little weight. However, I was
                    not convinced that there was little substantive difference between Singapore and
                    PRC law. The rights and obligations in respect of corporations and shareholding
                    do not seem to be the same. The Plaintiff’s expert had noted that PRC
                    Company Law would not be applicable to foreign companies not registered in the
                    PRC: I prefer his evidence that the PRC courts would not apply PRC Company Law
                    to the present dispute. I did not see anything in the Defendant’s
                    expert’s report that pointed the other way. That being the case, the type
                    of claim made by the Plaintiff could not be brought before the PRC courts, only
                    a contractual dispute, which is of a wholly different nature,
                could.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Defendants’ expert referred to a
                    number of provisions, but several of these do not seem to relate to anything
                    like a minority oppression action, but rather shareholders’ rights
                    generally, such as Articles 20 and 33 of the PRC Company Law. Reference was made
                    to Article 182 which permits winding up if there is the threat of heavy losses
                    to shareholders from difficulty in operations or management, but that does not
                    seem connected to the relationship of shareholders <em>inter
                        se</em>. While it is not necessary or even expected that PRC law would
                    contain a provision that provides the same type of claim as a minority
                    oppression action, the absence of an equivalent set of provisions giving the
                    same effect would be a factor that points to Singapore being a more appropriate
                    forum to hear such a claim. A forum that does not have a functional equivalent
                    would not in general be an appropriate forum unless for instance the claim was
                    but a sham or a disguise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Plaintiff took issue with the
                    Defendant’s expert’s assertion that the PRC courts could apply
                    Singapore law. There was nothing on this in the Plaintiff’s expert report,
                    presumably in light of the questions posed to him. However, while expert opinion
                    on foreign law is a matter of fact (at least of a special kind:<em>King v Brandywine Reinsurance Co</em> [2005] EWCA 235), I was
                    not convinced that the Defendant’s expert was of the view that Singapore
                    company law would be applied.His discussion in his affidavit seemed to be geared
                    towards considering whether PRC Company Law would be applicable to Singapore
                    registered companies if they had a different place of actual business. In any
                    event, even if a PRC court would apply Singapore company law, that does not make
                    the PRC the more appropriate forum. All the various factors would have to be
                    considered and weighed. A dispute about Singapore companies in respect of the
                    relations between the shareholders would seem to be more suited for
                    determination by a Singapore court unless there were significant countervailing
                    measures pointing the other way. I did not see any in the present
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion as to the more appropriate forum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     All in all then, Singapore was the more
                    appropriate forum in view of the nature of the claim asserted by the Plaintiff;
                    the various other factors in the present case were either neutral or if they
                    pointed to the PRC, did not outweigh those pointing to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of the Spiliada
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The unavailability of remedies in the PRC
                    relating to a s 216 action would be significant. I note that the fact that local
                    remedies may not be available abroad would not generally be sufficient to show
                    the loss of a juridical advantage – there must be a substantive element
                    rather than just a difference in quantum or degree: see <em>Spiliada</em> and <em>Goh Suan Huee v Teo Cher
                        Teck</em> [2010] 1 SLR 367 (“<em>Goh Suan
                        Hee</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Despite the evidence of the defendants’
                    expert that the same or similar remedies would be available in Chinese
                    proceedings, I accept the Plaintiff's expert’s evidence that these would
                    not. There is no directly equivalent provision to s 216. It was pointed out that
                    the precedents cited by the Defendant’s expert were not on point and did
                    not show the existence of a minority oppression action. Further, as argued by
                    the Plaintiff, the winding up of the 3<sup>rd</sup> and
                        4<sup>th</sup> Defendants would not be available to a PRC
                    Court in respect of a company law action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Defendants cited <em>Harrods</em> for the proposition that it was not essential that the
                    plaintiff should be able to obtain identical relief in the foreign jurisdiction
                    or that the courses of action which can be pursued should be the same in both
                    jurisdictions. <em>Harrods</em> itself is instructive as a
                    stay was granted in England though the claim was for minority oppression in an
                    English incorporated company, with the registered office in London but with its
                    business wholly in Argentina. However, departing from the CA in <em>Harrods</em>, I am of the view that the ability to be bought
                    out or to effect a winding up in respect of a dispute concerning the internal
                    relations of the company itself would be a sufficient basis. The ability to be
                    bought out, and the winding up of a Singapore company are material advantages,
                    which the plaintiff should not be deprived of. The participation by a
                    shareholder in a company would be premised on many things, but among the
                    considerations would be the expectation that as a member or shareholder he or
                    she would be entitled to have a voice in the running of the company, or if that
                    does not work out because of the actions or omission of the majority of the
                    shareholders or members, there would be the ability to exit the company by way
                    of a buy-out. Leaving aside the ability to be bought out in the case of
                    oppression or other concerted action by the majority may not achieve substantive
                    justice in respect of a complaining shareholder. That to my mind would affect
                    the achieving of substantive justice, as required by <em>Spiliada</em> and <em>Goh Suan
                Huee</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It may be argued that a shareholder in a
                    private company cannot really complain if he is stuck with his investment
                    – that is a normal risk that such an investor runs in such a company. But
                    the position where a shareholder suffers oppression would be different –
                    locking-in the shareholder in that situation piles on a disability on top of his
                    being subject to unfair actions by others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Thus even if I was wrong on Singapore being
                    the more appropriate forum, I would have found that the Plaintiff showed grounds
                    in favour of the Court’s exercise in favour of Singapore on the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Stay in respect of foreign proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Defendants applied alternatively for stay
                    on the grounds that there were foreign proceedings underway. This is recognised
                    as an independent basis separate from stay on <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. However, in the present case, the same result would
                    arise in view of my conclusions concerning the differences between the local
                    proceedings and those in the PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Leave to appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I granted leave to appeal in the present case
                    on the Defendants’ application, as I concluded that there was an issue of
                    importance that merited determination by the Court of Appeal for the guidance on
                    the law. The increased use of Singapore companies by foreign shareholders not
                    just in connection with businesses in Singapore but regionally and
                    internationally means that disputes similar to the present and <em>Transtech</em> will arise more frequently. It will assist the
                    development of Singapore law and business activity for the guidance given by the
                    apex court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the reasons above, I declined to stay the
                    Plaintiff’s claim. Costs of $10,000 and reasonable disbursements were
                    awarded to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I had noted in my oral remarks that I did not
                    think there was a significant difference in philosophy between the position I
                    had taken and the decisions in <em>Nasbulk</em> and
                        <em>Harrods</em>. I remain of that view in so far as
                    the broad application of the <em>Spiliada</em> principles
                    is concerned. Where I have differed from those decisions was essentially in the
                    characterisation of the nature of a minority oppression claim and its
                    remedies.</p>
