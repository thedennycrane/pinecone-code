</div>  The argument made by the Plaintiff was that the parties had not agreed to the ICC arbitration clause found in the Letter of Acceptance.  Instead, what parties had agreed to was one of the particular conditions which was issued with the tender document.  This particular condition was titled: “<span class="font-italic">Sub Clause 20.6 – Arbitration</span>” and it read as follows: “<span class="font-italic">Item (a) of first paragraph of Clause 20.6 is deleted and replaced with: (a) the dispute shall be finally settled as per the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995 of Sri Lanka and the place of Arbitration shall be of Colombo</span>” (the “Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause”).

While there had been intervening negotiations between the parties on the possibility of using ICC rules of arbitration and changing the venue of arbitration to Singapore, the parties eventually never agreed to the ICC Arbitration Clause contained in the Letter of Acceptance of 22 December 2015.  Thus, according to the Plaintiff, the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause which appeared in the tender package documentation was never “<span class="font-italic">displaced</span>” and remained applicable as the contractually agreed clause between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 What is not in dispute though is that the tribunal did not make a preliminary ruling on this jurisdictional dispute at any stage of the arbitral proceedings.  The Plaintiff had also not requested the tribunal to make such a ruling.  Instead, the parties proceeded with the evidential hearing dealing with all issues, which took place over 9 days in two tranches from 7 to 11 November 2016 and 31 January to 3 February 2017.

First, that the Court rule, pursuant to s 10 of the IAA read with Art 16(3) of the Model Law, that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute between the parties.  Second, further and or alternatively, that the Court set aside the arbitral award pursuant to s 3 of the IAA read with Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law because the tribunal had founded its jurisdiction on an invalid arbitration agreement.  The Plaintiff essentially raised the same arguments and relied on the same facts to substantiate its case for both remedies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Before me, the Plaintiff’s point was simply that the operative arbitration agreement between the parties was the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause found in the particular conditions that came with the tender package, and not the ICC Arbitration Clause.  It was argued that the Court should not simply look at the labels which the parties had titled their correspondence, such as the Letter of Acceptance issued by the Plaintiff.  Rather, when the correspondence and language used was viewed through a legal prism, one would conclude that there was never any agreement between the parties to arbitrate in Singapore under ICC rules.  This was because the Letter of Acceptance was legally a counter-offer by the Plaintiff, which had not been unequivocally accepted by the Defendant.  Further, this was an issue that was governed by Sri Lankan law, and the Plaintiff’s Sri Lankan law expert, Mr Mohamed Faisz Musthapha (“Mr Musthapha”), had reviewed the correspondence and opined that the parties had never reached an agreement in the terms of the ICC Arbitration Clause.

Thus, the tribunal was right in giving effect to the ICC Arbitration Clause found in the Letter of Acceptance.  Not only that, when the pre-contractual negotiations leading to the signing of the Contract Agreement was examined, it would make it doubly clear that parties did share a common intent to have any disputes arbitrated under ICC Rules in Singapore.  As for Sri Lankan law, the Defendant’s law expert, Mr Kanaganayagam Kanag-Isvaran (“Mr Kanag-Isvaran”), came to the opposite conclusion as Mr Musthapha, and opined that the parties had come to an agreement in the terms of the ICC Arbitration Clause.

</div>
</div>  The intent of this document is clear from its recitals which stated:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">“<span class="font-weight-bold">WHEREAS</span> the Contractor and the Procurement Committee (PC) of the Employer carried out negotiations on commercial &amp; contractual terms of the Tender submission made by the Contractor on 9th October 2014 and based on the “in principal” understanding between the Parties, the Contractor submitted its final negotiated offer subject to terms &amp; conditions therein on 15th October 2014 for acceptance by the Employer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">AND WHEREAS</span> the Employer having considered the said offer by the Contractor issued a Letter of Acceptance dated 22nd December 2014 accepting the offer made by the Contractor for Tender Package 2 (Guest Rooms, Guest Room Lobbies &amp; Corridors) for a price of Euro 28,869,372.00 subject to the terms of the Contract &amp; such other deviations as agreed between the Parties during the aforesaid negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">AND WHEREAS</span> the Parties here to are desirous of entering into this Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) in order to incorporate any deviations, to amend, delete or add new terms and conditions in the Contract documents”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Memorandum of Understanding proceeded to then set out 23 numbered paragraphs where the parties agreed to certain terms and also changes to clauses found in the tender document appendices and the Particular Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There was no arbitration clause in the Contract Document or the Memorandum of Understanding.  Nor were the Particular Conditions specifically amended to include Sub-Clause 20.6 in the form set out in Mr Weerakoon’s email of 3 January 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 One of the main points of contention between the parties was obviously the effect of the Letter of Acceptance.  The Plaintiff submitted that the Letter of Acceptance must not be taken literally as an acceptance of the Defendant’s offer to contract.  According to the Plaintiff, if one examines the words used in the Letter of Acceptance, it was a proposal by the Plaintiff that the ten numbered clauses be added as terms of the contract or that the terms of the proposed offer by the Defendant be varied by those clauses.  According to the Plaintiff, Clause 9 – the ICC Arbitration Clause – was being proposed by the Plaintiff together with the other nine clauses as a package of new terms for the Defendant to accept.  In other words, the entire contents of the Letter of Acceptance was legally a counter-offer by the Plaintiff, which had to be accepted or rejected by the Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Plaintiff submitted that the letter of 3 January 2015 from the Defendant in response was not an acceptance of the Plaintiff’s counter-offer, but rather an attempt to continue negotiating certain terms.  The Defendant only indicated its acceptance of two of the ten clauses offered by the Plaintiff, that is, the time for completion being 240 days (clause 2 of the Letter of Acceptance) and the performance guarantee (clause 3 of the Letter of Acceptance).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Don Rajendra Prasad Abeyasinghe’s affidavit (22 Dec 17) at pp 41. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  That was why further meetings were proposed to be held on 6-7 January 2015 for more negotiations to take place.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 According to the Plaintiff, that meant that, as at 3 January 2015, Particular Condition Sub Clause 20.6 containing the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause “<span class="font-italic">still applied</span>” and was “<span class="font-italic">valid and subsisting even at that stage</span>”.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As for the documents executed on 7 January 2015, the Plaintiff argued that the parties’ intention was that any variations to the tender document conditions were to be all incorporated into the Memorandum of Understanding.  The ICC Arbitration Clause was not mentioned in the Memorandum of Understanding and this showed that the clause was never agreed to by the parties.  The Plaintiff’s proposed clause 9 of the Letter of Acceptance had thus been discarded by the parties.  This meant that the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause continued to apply.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 With respect, I found the Plaintiff’s arguments difficult to follow.  The language in the Letter of Acceptance, Contract Document and Memorandum of Understanding, as I have set out above, contradicted the Plaintiff’s characterization of the purpose of these documents.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I agree with counsel for the Defendant that the proper starting point in the analysis is the Contract Agreement signed by the parties on 7 January 2015.  This document was executed by the parties after the tender process, exchange of letters and negotiations.  The terms of the Contract Agreement are plain and unambiguous in stating that the Letter of Acceptance was a part of the agreement between the parties.  It did not state that only portions of the Letter of Acceptance were part of the parties’ contract.  Thus, in my view, there was quite clearly a valid arbitration agreement between the parties to arbitrate using ICC rules in Singapore because the ICC Arbitration Clause was clause 9 of the Letter of Acceptance.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Clause 2 of the Contract Agreement also sets out a priority of the contractual documents when it comes to questions of interpretation.  I read this to mean that, if there is an inconsistency or conflict between two or more terms set out in the contractual documents, the term found in the contractual document with higher priority will prevail over those found in contractual documents with lower priority.  Applying this rule of construction which the parties had agreed to, the ICC Arbitration Clause in the Letter of Acceptance prevailed over the Sri Lankan Arbitration Clause in the Particular Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I cannot accept the contention by the Plaintiff that there was no inconsistency or ambiguity in the contractual documents that would attract the application of the priority rule set out in clause 2 of the Contract Agreement.  From the positions taken by the parties, there was clearly a contest between the applicability of two arbitration clauses found in two contractual documents.  In my judgment, this was precisely the type of scenario to which the priority rule was intended to apply.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I accepted the Defendant’s argument that, since there was no arbitration clause in the Memorandum of Understanding, even though it ranked in priority over the Letter of Acceptance, there was nothing in the Memorandum of Understanding that would override the ICC Arbitration Clause found in the Letter of Acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Both counsel also submitted that I should look at the context of the agreement, in the form of the correspondence and pre-contractual negotiations leading to the Contract Agreement of 7 January 2015.  I did so and an examination of the relevant context only confirms my view that the parties had agreed to the ICC Arbitration Clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The conduct of the parties leading up to the Letter of Acceptance left me in little doubt that, during negotiations, the parties had differing views as to what the appropriate arbitration rules and venue should be.  There were discussions on the issue in the Colombo meeting on 9 October 2014, but no resolution was reached then.  I find that the parties proceeded on the basis that the Defendant should nonetheless proceed with its “final offer”, which it did so on 15 October 2014, and that the Plaintiff needed time to consider the Defendant’s proposals on the arbitration rules and venue.  The minutes of the 9 October 2014 Colombo meeting did note that they would agree on the arbitration rules before the contract was finalised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Then came the Letter of Acceptance that was sent by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on 22 December 2014.  I found it difficult to accept the Plaintiff’s argument that the Letter of Acceptance was a counter-offer by the Plaintiff.  The language used in that document showed that the Plaintiff was quite clearly accepting the offer made by the Defendant in its letter of 15 October 2014, which the Plaintiff described as the “<span class="font-italic">final negotiated offer</span>”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is true that the Plaintiff’s “<span class="font-italic">final </span><span class="font-italic">negotiated offer</span>” of 15 October 2014 did not make reference to any arbitration clause, but the minutes of the Colombo meeting on 9 October 2014 did indicate that the parties had discussed the Defendant’s wish to have arbitration in accordance with ICC rules and the Plaintiff’s indication that it might agree to arbitration being held in Singapore.  This showed that both parties had at the very least contemplated that arbitration could be in Singapore.  As mentioned earlier, the Plaintiff needed time to consider the matter.  I find that the Plaintiff’s subsequent inclusion of the ICC Arbitration Clause in the Letter of Acceptance of 22 December 2014 was an acknowledgement of the Defendant’s wishes and reflected the acceptance by the Plaintiff that they would be prepared to arbitrate in accordance with the ICC rules in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 If I am wrong that clause 9 of the Letter of Acceptance reflected an arbitration agreement reached by 22 December 2014 for ICC arbitration in Singapore, and I adopt the Plaintiff’s analysis that it was counter-offering an arbitration clause requiring ICC arbitration in Singapore, I find that this counter-offer was accepted by the Defendant in its reply letter of 3 January 2015.  In this letter, the Defendant thanked the Plaintiff for accepting its offer, and also acknowledged the Plaintiff’s instruction to proceed with the contracted works.  There is no dispute that the Defendant did commence work accordingly.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Alternatively, if the letter of 3 January 2015 was not clear enough to constitute an unequivocal acceptance, I find that the Plaintiff’s counter-offer was accepted on 7 January 2015 when the parties executed the Contract Document, which stipulated the Letter of Acceptance to be a contractual document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Counsel for the Plaintiff placed much store on the Memorandum of Understanding signed on 7 January 2015.  But, I found it difficult to accept the Plaintiff’s arguments that the Memorandum of Understanding was intended to comprehensively consolidate <span class="font-italic">all</span> the changes to the contractual terms into one document and the fact that the Memorandum of Understanding did not include the ICC Arbitration Clause showed that the parties had not agreed to it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agree with counsel for the Defendant’s argument that the purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding was to deal with the contractual issues which remain unresolved as at the time the parties met on 6 and 7 January 2015 to carry out their final negotiations.  I think this is made amply clear by the recitals to the Memorandum of Understanding, in particular, the portion which records that the purpose of the document was to “<span class="font-italic">incorporate any deviations, to amend, delete or add new terms and conditions in the </span><span class="font-italic">Contract documents</span>”.  The fact that the Memorandum of Understanding was listed first in terms of priority of the contractual documents at clause 2 of the Contract Agreement reinforces the point that it was intended to include the very final issues that remained outstanding between the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Hence, if it was an issue that had already been agreed earlier, like the ICC Arbitration Clause found in the Letter of Acceptance, there was no need to include it in the Memorandum of Understanding.  It continued to remain binding as confirmed by the specific mention of the Letter of Acceptance as a contractual document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I should also add that, if the Plaintiff is right that the Memorandum of Understanding was intended to exhaustively record all the changes to the FIDIC General Conditions and the Particular Conditions, that would mean that the Letter of Acceptance was no longer a document that the parties should concern themselves with.  Yet, if that was the case, there would have been no reason for the Letter of Acceptance to be expressly named by the parties in the Contract Agreement as forming a part of their agreement.  The fact that the parties agreed that the Letter of Acceptance was a contractual document shows that its terms were intended to have contractual effect.  That in turn meant that the Memorandum of Understanding could not have been an exhaustive record of all the agreed changes to the FIDIC General Conditions and the Particulars Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sri Lankan law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The parties were in agreement that Sri Lankan law was the proper law of the contract and governed the question of which arbitration clause was applicable.  That was the basis upon which the matter proceeded before the arbitral tribunal, with both parties having had Sri Lankan counsel to lead their cases in the arbitration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Before me, while both parties filed two reports each from their respective Sri Lankan law experts, I was not able to discern from their reports any particular principle or statutory provision under Sri Lankan law that would affect my analysis and the conclusions I have reached above.  At the hearing, both counsel for the Plaintiff and the Defendant confirmed my view.  They were in agreement that the general principles of Sri Lankan law as to the construction of contract terms and the formation of contracts were not materially different from those in English law.

</div>  In fact, both experts had referred to well-known English cases on contracts in the course of their reasoning as to whether the parties had indeed reached an agreement on the ICC Arbitration Clause.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The disagreement between the experts was whether the Sri Lankan courts would apply purely English law principles when dealing with contracts of a commercial nature.  Mr Musthapha, the Plaintiff’s expert, was of the view that the law applying to such contracts is the common law of Sri Lanka, <span class="font-italic">i.e</span>., Roman Dutch law, insofar it has been modified based on developments in English law.

</div>  I do not think that this distinction was particularly material in the context of this case because, as pointed above, both experts proceeded to analyse the issue of which was the applicable arbitration agreement using familiar principles of English law.  I was fortified in this view by the Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission at the hearing, to which the Defendant’s counsel did not disagree, that this Court can decide the disputed issue by applying principles of English and Singapore contract law.

</div>  Mr Abeyasinghe also gave different dates as to when the Plaintiff first found these minutes.  Second, the Defendant also drew my attention to the fact that the draft minutes differed materially from the finalised minutes, and there was no explanation by the Plaintiff as to why this was so.  Third, both sets of minutes had not been signed by the chairman of the board.

In such situations, the appropriate remedy would be for the Plaintiff to seek recourse against the final award, in the form of setting aside the award pursuant to Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law.  The Plaintiff has done so and it is to that remedy I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed at the hearing that reliance was placed on the following highlighted words in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law:
