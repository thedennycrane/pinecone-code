The plaintiff and the first defendant did not dispute that their respective shares in each of the Companies were matrimonial assets liable for division and allocation in the Divorce Proceedings.

Ultimately, the grant of a limited stay of proceedings is a discretionary exercise of the court’s case management powers. This discretion is triggered when there is a multiplicity of proceedings; and in exercising these powers, the court is entitled to consider all the circumstances of the case. The underlying concern is the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In <span class="font-italic">Ram Mittal</span>, the High Court observed at [52] and [53] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 … The case law has instead suggested that the discretion to grant a limited stay entails the court taking a commonsensical and practical approach, bearing in mind considerations such as multiplicity in proceedings, the risk of conflicting judgments, international comity and fairness to the parties … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 … I found the factors in <span class="font-italic">Sterling </span>to be a useful guide in deciding whether to grant a limited stay. I was, however, also mindful that these factors were not to be applied mechanically. The case did not turn on how many of the factors in <span class="font-italic">Sterling </span>are present in a ‘tick the boxes’ approach. Rather, keeping with the commonsensical and practical approach suggested at [52] above, the weight to be attached to each factor, and therefore the ultimate exercise of the court’s discretion to grant a limited stay, will depend on the facts and nuances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant a stay under the SCJA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Applying these principles to the facts, I was of the view that it was in the best interest for the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole to grant a stay of the proceedings in the Suit pending the determination of the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings. This was for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Substantial overlap between the Divorce Proceedings and the Suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I was aware that the issues pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets and the minority oppression claim were different. The FJC would consider the direct and indirect contributions of the plaintiff and the first defendant during their marriage in order to ascertain an equitable division of the matrimonial assets. As for the Suit, the plaintiff had to prove that there were oppressive acts by the first defendant in relation to the plaintiff, the minority shareholder, before the court will grant an order directing the first defendant to purchase the plaintiff’s shares in the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, the central focus in the Suit and the hearing of the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings would be the plaintiff’s shares in the Companies. In the Suit the plaintiff sought, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an order for the first defendant to purchase all of the plaintiff’s shares in the Companies. In the hearing of ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings, the FJC would have to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets which include their shares in the Companies. Hence, there would be substantial overlap between the issues relating to the shares in the Companies arising from the Divorce Proceedings and those arising in the present Suit. Thus, there was a risk of there being a multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting findings arising therefrom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 One such overlap pertained to the circumstances surrounding the Companies’ respective incorporations, the plaintiff’s and the first defendant’s respective roles and contributions to the Companies and to their marriage, as well as the alleged acts of oppression committed by the first defendant.

</div> These were disputed factual issues raised in both the Divorce Proceedings and the Suit. They would be pertinent to the FJC’s determination of the appropriate division of matrimonial assets, including the plaintiff’s and the first defendant’s shares in the Companies. They would also be critical to this court’s consideration of the plaintiff’s oppression claim as they laid the factual foundation for the elements making up the oppression claim.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Another instance of overlap between the Divorce Proceedings and the Suit was in relation to the plaintiff’s shares in each of the Companies. There was a possibility in the Divorce Proceedings that the plaintiff might be ordered to transfer his shares in all the Companies or selected Companies to the first defendant or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. This would be a function of the court’s power to divide the matrimonial assets (see s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)). Furthermore, at the time of the hearing of SUM 4454, the valuation of the shares was a heavily disputed issue in the Divorce Proceedings,

</div>
</div> and would also be heavily disputed in the Suit. The valuation of the shares in the Companies would be required for the Suit and the Divorce Proceedings. If a stay were not granted, the courts in both proceedings would likely undertake a valuation of the <span class="font-italic">same </span>set of shares and make certain orders in respect of the disposal of such shares. This overlap in relation to the plaintiff’s shares had further implications in terms of the effect that the Divorce Proceedings might have on the Suit and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>, which I shall elaborate on below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 For these reasons, I was of the view that there was substantial overlap between the Divorce Proceedings and the Suit, resulting in a risk of there being a multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting findings. Not only would it be undesirable for the FJC and this court to “compete” to see which court first determined the overlapping issues of facts, it would also result in a duplication of work, thereby wasting the courts’ and the parties’ time and resources.

Instead, it suffices that “the basic premises upon which the two actions are founded are to all practical intents and purposes very much the same”, such that there is a “considerable overlap in the issues to be determined” (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung </span>at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The plaintiff also raised several arguments relating to jurisdiction, the nature of the remedies sought in each proceeding, and the inability of the procedural rules in the Divorce Proceedings to address the disputes raised in the Suit.

</div> However, the grant of a stay did not mean that the FJC would thereby have to determine the cause of action raised in this Suit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff’s oppression claim). It only meant that the hearing of the oppression claim in the Suit would be temporarily held in abeyance pending the determination of the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings.

This arose in part from the substantial overlap between the two proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The primary remedy sought for by the plaintiff in the Suit was the Share Buyout – a buyout of the plaintiff’s shares in each of the Companies by the first defendant. However, as observed at [19] above, the FJC might, in the exercise of its power to divide the matrimonial assets, order the plaintiff to transfer some or all of his shares in each of the Companies to the first defendant. Conversely, the FJC might order the first defendant to transfer to the plaintiff some or all of her shares in each of the Companies. Either of these orders would significantly affect any share buyout which this court could potentially order in the Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 If the plaintiff were ordered by the FJC to transfer all of his shares in each of the Companies to the first defendant, the Share Buyout would be rendered otiose.

</div> However, I raise this only as a <span class="font-italic">possible </span>argument, and express no views on the correctness or otherwise of this argument as it was not crucial to the determination of SUM 4454. Conversely, if the first defendant were ordered by the FJC to transfer all of her shares in each of the Companies to the plaintiff, then the plaintiff’s claim in the Suit might not proceed as the plaintiff would have become the majority shareholder and would have control of the Companies. Hence, the plaintiff’s current action in minority oppression might not be necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the other hand, if the oppression claim in the Suit were determined prior to the FJC’s determination of the division of assets, this would also have significant implications on the Divorce Proceedings. If the Share Buyout were ordered, it may disturb the state of the parties’ matrimonial assets and consequently, the entire premise of the FJC’s ongoing determination of the division of assets. The FJC may have to adjust its determination of the division of assets to take into account the effects of the Share Buyout. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In these circumstances, the plaintiff’s submission that the FJC’s orders regarding the plaintiff’s and the first defendant’s shareholdings would have “no impact” on the Suit was untenable.

</div> In my view, it was much more just and efficient to stay the proceedings in the Suit pending the determination of the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The logical and sensible approach was to allow the hearing of ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings to run its course so that the FJC could make its decision on the apportionment of the parties’ matrimonial assets. The parties would then know precisely the quantum of the shares that each party holds. Thereafter, the Suit, if necessary, would be able to proceed with certainty on the shareholdings of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Valuation of the shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The value of the shares in the Companies owned by the parties was important to the hearing of ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings and the Suit. The shares had already been valued by an independent valuer, KordaMentha, appointed by the FJC with the mutual agreement of the parties. However, the plaintiff rejected this valuation report on the ground that the shares were valued at the current market value without taking into account the oppressive acts of the first defendant. In this light, the Suit appeared to be the plaintiff’s attempt to seek another valuation of the shares. This should not be allowed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Divorce Proceedings were at a more advanced stage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, I also took into consideration the fact that the Divorce Proceedings were at a more advanced stage than the Suit. At the time of the hearing of SUM 4454, the plaintiff and the first defendant were in the discovery stage in relation to the ancillary matters. They had filed their respective Requests for Discovery and Requests for Interrogatories, and were due to provide their Notices in Response as well as disclose the documents and information they were willing to produce. In contrast, the Suit was only at the close of pleadings stage.
