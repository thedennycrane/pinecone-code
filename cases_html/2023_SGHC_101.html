That clause is part of the body of the agreement and records or establishes an obligation to pay for certain services at a specified mark up. This raises the question whether it is even an objection that goes to jurisdiction rather than the merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The parties, CYY and CYZ, are companies involved in the marine salvage industry.

The Owner was represented by its managing director, who I shall refer to as Mr Y. Unlike the Charterer, the Owner is physically established in the region of the Salvage Operation. Mr X specifically sought to hire the Crane Barge as it was purpose-built and uniquely equipped to assist with the Salvage Operation. Mr X also had prior experience working with the Crane Barge. As the salvage site was offshore, the Crane Barge was to serve as an offshore command centre for the Salvage Operation, hosting salvage personnel, equipment, and cargo. Given the urgency of the Salvage Operation, this course of action was determined to be more pragmatic than the alternative of repeatedly ferrying salvage personnel to and from the closest port.

In contrast, the Charterer did not have any physical presence in the region and essentially relied on the Owner to procure everything it needed for the Salvage Operation. Mr X therefore agreed with Mr Y that all procurement services undertaken by the Owner at the Charterer’s request would be paid at cost plus a 15% margin. This agreement was then eventually reflected as cl 39 of the Contract.

</div> Before me, the first objection is not pursued as it is accepted that the insertion of the letter (c) was merely a typographical error and alternative (d) applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In relation to the second objection, the Tribunal observed that the scope of cl 39 was uncertain when considered in a vacuum. The Tribunal thus adopted a contextual interpretation and determined that cl 39 encompassed all procurement services rendered by the Owner in relation to the <span class="font-italic">entire </span><span class="font-italic">Salvage Operation</span>. This was an interpretation that the express words of cl 39 could reasonably bear. The Contract had been concluded in the context of an emergency and the “overall commercial purpose of the [Contract] was to urgently salvage [the Casualty]”. The Charterers had no presence, equipment, or resources in the locality, and it was thus “intended that the [Owner] was to play an important role in procuring and providing resources, equipment and personnel to support the Salvage Operation”. Although the Contract was a standard form contract, the fact remained that cl 39 was an additional clause specifically added by the parties and was therefore intended to address matters not covered by BIMCO Supplytime 2017. The Tribunal did not take into consideration any purported oral agreement reached between Mr X and Mr Y prior to the Contract. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal found that it was unnecessary to determine whether it had jurisdiction to determine the <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>claim. Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that, considering the aforementioned context of the Contract and the fact that the Contract expressly named the Casualty as the area of operation of the Crane Barge, the <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>claim also fell within the scope of the arbitration clause.

The Charterer submits that cl 39 must be strictly limited to procurement services rendered in relation to the charter of the Crane Barge, and not services rendered in relation to the Salvage Operation generally. Conversely, the Owner submits that cl 39 should encompass all procurement services requested by the Charterer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Charterer’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In a nutshell, the Charterer submits that because cl 39 is contained in a contract based on BIMCO Supplytime 2017, a standard form contract for the charter of offshore support vessels, cl 39 must be construed to apply only to procurement services rendered in relation to the charter of the Crane Barge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Although it is undisputed that cl 39 was an additional clause included by the parties and extraneous to BIMCO Supplytime 2017, the Charterer submits that a restrained interpretative approach should be adopted because BIMCO Supplytime 2017 is a standard form contract. The predictability of standard form contracts, and hence their value, will be damaged if the interpretation of standard terms is inconsistent. Thus, the Charterer submits that the background context and factual matrix should have little relevance to the interpretation of cl 39. Instead, the choice of BIMCO Supplytime 2017, a time charter, evinces the objective intention to confine the scope of cl 39 to the procurement of services relating only to the charter of the Crane Barge.

Instead, it would have been more appropriate to use a broader master agreement such as the Wreckhire 2010, another BIMCO standard form contract designed to govern entire salvage operations. The Wreckhire 2010 explicitly contemplates matters that must be addressed when dealing with an entire salvage operation, such as daily rates and third-party expenses, and is better able to accommodate requests for additional services as an operation progresses. As both parties are experienced industry players familiar with the available standard forms, the choice of BIMCO Supplytime 2017 must have been a conscious decision to limit the scope of their agreement. Furthermore, the Contract does not <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> state that the Contract is for the purpose of the Salvage Operation. Thus, the Contract is no more than a time charter for the Crane Barge. It is commercially inconceivable and there is no indication that the parties intended that the entire costs incurred by the Salvage Operation would be covered by a single line in cl 39 rather than by an appropriate master contract.

I posed this question to counsel at the oral hearing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jurisdictional review under s 10(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) IAA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is established that a review on jurisdiction pursuant to s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) IAA is conducted <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> with no deference granted to the Tribunal’s findings, though the court is entitled to consider what the Tribunal has said: <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Ltd v Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic</span> [2016] 5 SLR 536 at [41]–[43]. Nevertheless, the court must guard against ingenious attempts to disguise substantive challenges as challenges to jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">BTN and another v BTP and another</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1250 at [45].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this case, the Ruling is expressly framed as a determination of the jurisdiction challenge and the Tribunal appears to refrain from addressing the merits. However, cl 39 imposes a substantive obligation on the Charterer and is the basis upon which the Owner brings its claim. I therefore directed the Charterer to clarify why the interpretation of a substantive clause of the Contract is appropriate for jurisdictional review under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) IAA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Charterer’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Charterer submits that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction stems from the arbitration clause contained in the Contract. As the arbitration clause refers to disputes arising out of or in connection with the Contract, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction therefore depends on the scope of the Contract. If a matter falls outside the scope of the Contract, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. The argument therefore goes that a determination by the Tribunal on the scope of the Contract is necessarily a jurisdictional decision which is subject to review. According to the Charterer, the Tribunal erred in finding that the overall commercial purpose of the Contract was to urgently salvage the Casualty. Instead, the Contract is limited to matters relating to the Charter of the Crane Barge. This means that cl 39 is similarly limited to procurement services rendered only in relation to the charter of the Crane Barge. This issue of interpretation is, in the Charterer’s submission, appropriate for jurisdictional review under s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) IAA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the interpretation of cl 39 goes to jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my judgment, the interpretation of cl 39 is a matter that comes within the merits of the dispute referred to arbitration. The Charterer has now accepted that there was a binding arbitration agreement. Thus, the question of whether the Owner’s claims in respect of procurement services fall within cl 39 is a matter for the Tribunal to determine as part of the dispute referred by parties. Questions of what a clause within the body of a contract applies to are common. For example, in a sale of goods contract there is often an issue of whether the goods delivered are of the type contracted for. Sometimes, this depends on how the clause is interpreted. I gave the example during the oral hearing of a contract for sale of English apples. This could mean apples of any traditional English variety wherever grown, or apples of any variety grown in England. If there is an arbitration clause applying to the contract and the arbitrator decides on one of the two possible interpretations of the clause concerning the nature of the goods to be sold and delivered, and thus either allows or rejects the claim, she would be acting within her jurisdiction: precisely deciding an issue that has been submitted to her. It is an error to recast this question as her having jurisdiction only to allow claims that come within the clause as properly interpreted. The effect of this error would be to change the decision maker for a question of contractual interpretation concerning a substantive obligation of parties from the arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties to the court upon a jurisdictional challenge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Interpretation of a substantive clause within the contract ordinarily concerns the admissibility of the claim made. This differs from interpretation of the arbitration agreement contained within the contract. Interpretation of the arbitration clause might go to jurisdiction where the difference between the parties relates to the scope of the arbitration agreement. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and others v Kingdom of Lesotho</span> [2019] 1 SLR 263<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [207]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Jurisdiction is commonly defined to refer to “the power of the tribunal to hear a case”, whereas admissibility refers to “whether it is appropriate for the tribunal to hear it”: <span class="font-italic">Waste Management, Inc v United Mexican States</span> ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/98/2, Dissenting Opinion of Keith Highet (8 May 2000) at [58]. To this, Zachary Douglas adds clarity to this discussion by referring to “jurisdiction” as a concept that deals with “the existence of [the] adjudicative power” of an arbitral tribunal, and to “admissibility” as a concept dealing with “the exercise of that power” and the suitability of the claim brought pursuant to that power for adjudication: <span class="font-italic">Douglas</span> at paras 291 and 310. Finally, in Chin Leng Lim, Jean Ho &amp; Martins Paparinskis, <span class="font-italic">International Investment Law and Arbitration: Commentary, Awards and other Materials</span> (Cambridge University Press, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Lim</span>”), it is usefully observed that there are two ways of drawing the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility (at p 118):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The more conceptual reading would focus on the legal nature of the objection: is it directed against the tribunal (and is hence jurisdictional) or is it directed at the claim (and is hence one of admissibility)? The more draftsmanlike reading would focus on the place that the issue occupies in the structure of international dispute settlement: is the challenge related to the interpretation and application of the jurisdictional clause of the international tribunal (and hence jurisdictional), or is it related to the interpretation and application of another rule or instrument (and is hence one of admissibility)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view, the interpretation of cl 39, and specifically what was meant to be covered by the phrase “all procurement services” is a matter of admissibility. The objection is directed at the claim rather than the Tribunal’s authority under the arbitration agreement. Consequently, its interpretation is not a matter for this court, even if the Tribunal reached what the court might consider to be the wrong conclusion on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Nonetheless, as counsel and the Tribunal appear to have proceeded on the basis that the interpretation of cl 39 goes to jurisdiction, I will now consider its interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The correct interpretation of cl 39</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Charterer contended before me that its filing of affidavits in these proceedings has provided me with more of the relevant context than had been available to the Tribunal. However, it is readily apparent that the Charterer is not relying upon any direct evidence of the negotiations and context surrounding the execution of the Contract. This is because Mr X, who represented the Charterer at all material times during the negotiations, has filed an affidavit on behalf of the Owner in this application. The relationship between Mr X and the Charterer broke down after the Salvage Operation.

</div> the Charterer submitted that the evidence of Mr X and Mr Y should be disregarded for the purpose of interpretation. Instead, the context should be limited to Mr Z’s opinion and understanding of the email correspondence as the true representative of the Charterer. The Charterer also sought to downplay Mr X’s involvement and suggested that Mr X did not have the authority to represent the Charterer. However, when I invited them to do so, the Charterer declined to take a firm position on the issue of actual or apparent authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 These allegations, which were first made at the oral hearing, are not supported by the evidence.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Although there was no express explanation concerning the scope of cl 39 communicated on behalf of the Owner to Mr Z at that time, it is evident that Mr Z simply accepted it provided that Mr X had<span class="font-italic"> </span>agreed to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Consequently, the context as it appears in the evidence before me is drawn from the objective evidence of what “crossed the table” between Mr X and Mr Y as representatives of the parties. I accept that the Contract was concluded under circumstances of urgency, and that the Charterer had to rely on the resources of the Owner as a local operator. These facts would support the broader reading of cl 39 as they would be consistent with the need for the Crane Barge to be properly staffed and equipped as the needs of the Salvage Operation evolved. I also accept that parties envisaged that the Crane Barge would operate as the offshore command centre for the Salvage Operation. This also supports the broader reading of cl 39 in that it would make sense to consider the Contract (which was for charter of the Crane Barge) as the key contract and thus bring ancillary and broadly related procurement services within it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 There is logic in the Charterer’s submissions that ordinarily additional clauses inserted into the charterparty for one vessel should be read as relating to that vessel. There might conceivably have been more appropriate or more logical ways of organising the contractual provisions, including by entering into a contract based instead on Wreckhire 2010 or having some other form of master agreement. But this argument effectively concedes the point that parties needed to place their agreement on general procurement services relating to the Salvage Operation somewhere. Once that is accepted, there is nothing illogical about including that agreement in the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Text</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Turning to the text of cl 39, the second sentence is drafted broadly (see above at [9]). There is no reason to restrict the meaning of the word “all”. The controlling requirement is that the procurement services so chargeable must have been “at the request of the Charterer”. Thus, whatever procurement services were requested by the Charterer and supplied by the Owner had to be paid for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51  Moreover, the first and second sentences of cl 39 concern different matters and can and should be read independently. The second sentence is not subsidiary or ancillary to the first. What unites the two sentences is that they both concern things that the Charterer will have to pay for. The first is what the Charterer might take or use on board the Crane Barge, while the second is what the Charter might request the Owner to supply. The fact that the first sentence includes the limiting words “on board” does not suggest that similar limiting words should be read into the second sentence. The control that the Charterer could exercise over what it had to pay was via what it chose to request from the Owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Accordingly, even if the interpretation of cl 39 went to jurisdiction, I agree with the Tribunal’s interpretation. In fact, I would add that in my view the clause is phrased plainly and clearly, and there is little need to consider the context to interpret it. It reads as a free-standing obligation to pay at the specified mark up for procurement services requested. In any case, the context supported this plain meaning of the clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A further point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There is a further point. Before me, the submissions of both parties delved into how related to the Crane Barge the various services supplied were, as set out in the invoices that formed the Disputed Claims. A cursory review of the invoices established that there were indeed many items that on their face appeared to be linked to the Crane Barge. As noted at [12] above, they were issued contemporaneously and countersigned by Mr X on behalf of the Charterer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This reinforces my view that the application of cl 39 went to the merits and not to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is obviously a merits question whether all the invoiced items or only some of them should be recoverable. This question remains to be decided by the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I dismiss the Charterer’s application and hold that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.
