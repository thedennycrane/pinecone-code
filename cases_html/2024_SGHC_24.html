class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 These are separate applications by two King’s Counsel for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission to practise as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore. In HC/OA 696/2023 (“OA 696”), Mr Theodoros Kassimatis KC (“Mr Kassimatis KC”) seeks <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission to act for two persons, Jumaat bin Mohamed Sayed (“Jumaat”) and Saminathan Selvaraju (“Saminathan”), in the matters of CA/CA 2/2023 (“CA 2”) and CA/SUM 16/2023 (“SUM 16”). In HC/OA 811/2023 (“OA 811”), Mr Edward Fitzgerald KC (“Mr Fitzgerald KC”) seeks <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission to act for other two persons, Datchinamurthy a/l Kataiah (“Datchinamurthy”) and Lingkesvaran Rajendaren (“Lingkesvaran”), in the same matters of CA 2 and SUM 16. I will refer to both King’s Counsel as the “Applicants” or individually the “Applicant”, and their applications as the “Applications” or individually the “Application”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The respondents in each Application are the Attorney-General (“AG”) and the Law Society of Singapore (“LSS”). I will refer to them collectively as the “Respondents”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Each of the four persons whom the Applicants seek to act for was accused of an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) although their current attempt to seek relief is in respect of the present version of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (2020 Rev Ed). As there is no difference in the relevant provisions in either version, I will refer to both versions simply as the “MDA”. Each of the four persons was convicted at trial and sentenced to suffer the death penalty, and their respective appeals against their convictions have been dismissed. Various civil applications were then filed by one or more of the four persons. In particular, the four persons filed HC/OA 480/2022 (“OA 480”) for permission to commence judicial review proceedings as elaborated later. I will refer to the four persons collectively as the “Claimants”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Written submissions were filed by the Applicants and the Respondents in respect of the Applications. The Respondents took a preliminary objection that the Applicants were not entitled to address the court on the Applications, given that they had not yet been admitted to practise as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore (the “Preliminary Objection”). On 16 October 2023, after hearing arguments on the Preliminary Objection, I upheld that objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Although the Claimants could then have sought an adjournment to seek the assistance of local counsel, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an advocate and solicitor practising in Singapore, to make submissions on the Applications, this avenue was not pursued. This avenue was available even though the Claimants say that they have not been able to obtain the services of local counsel to act for them in respect of CA 2 and SUM 16, which I elaborate on later. Instead, I was informed that the Claimants wished to address the court on the Applications, which they were entitled to do. I was also informed that their submissions would be substantively the same as those of the Applicants save for the part which addressed the Preliminary Objection. I gave directions for their submissions to be filed and served by 6 November 2023. The Claimants duly filed their submissions and orally addressed me through Datchinamurthy on the Applications at the hearing on 23 November 2023. The Respondents’ written submissions had already been tendered and they too made oral submissions on 23 November 2023. Thereafter, I invited further submissions on a point which I elaborate on later. I now provide the reasons for my decision on the Preliminary Objection and my judgment on the Applications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Kassimatis KC was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia in 2001 and his principal practice area is criminal law at the trial and appellate level. He was appointed Senior Counsel in November 2016 and Queen’s Counsel in March 2017. Mr Fitzgerald KC was called to the Bar of England and Wales in November 1978 and practiced almost exclusively criminal law. He was appointed Queen’s Counsel in January 1995.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, the designations of Mr Kassimatis KC and Mr Fitzgerald KC were automatically changed from Queen’s Counsel to King’s Counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As already noted, the Claimants were convicted of offences under the MDA and sentenced to suffer the death penalty, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 7 May 2018, Jumaat was convicted of trafficking in diamorphine under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA and was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Jumaat bin Mohamed Sayed</span> [2018] SGHC 176 at [1]–[4]).

The Claimants sought the following reliefs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. A Declaration that the Presumptions contained in Section 18(1) and 18(2) of the [MDA] which were imposed upon the Claimants should be read down and given effect as imposing an evidential burden only in Compliance with Articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution and the Common law Presumption of innocence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. Alternatively, a Declaration that the Presumption upon Presumption contained in Section 18(2) read with Section 18(1) of the MDA which were imposed upon the Claimants are unconstitution [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] for violating Articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. A Prohibitory order against the execution of the death sentences upon the Claimants.​</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The crux of the Claimants’ case in OA 480 was that ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA, which provide for the double presumptions of possession and knowledge respectively, were incompatible with the presumption of innocence that is protected under the Constitution. Sections 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1)  Any person who is proved to have had in his or her possession or custody or under his or her control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">    (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">    (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">    (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in  which a controlled drug is found; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had that drug in his or her possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his or her possession is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 One of the arguments raised by the AG in response was that OA 480 effectively sought a reconsideration of the Claimants’ convictions, and the correct procedure for the Claimants to do so was to file a review application under s 394H of the CPC. Further, under O 24 r 5(2) of the Rules of Court 2021, an application for judicial review must be made within three months from the date of the final determinations in each of the Claimants’ respective criminal proceedings, and that time had since lapsed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 25 November 2022, Valerie Thean J dismissed OA 480 (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat bin Mohamed Sayed and others v Attorney-General</span> [2022] SGHC 291 (“<span class="font-italic">Jumaat (HC)</span>”) at [2]). One of her reasons was that the subject matter of OA 480 was not susceptible to judicial review. She accepted the AG’s submission that if there was a valid reason to reconsider the Claimants’ convictions, the proper manner of doing so was a review application under s 394H of the CPC and not by way of judicial review. However, the Claimants would not have been able to meet the requirements under s 394J of the CPC for commencing a review application (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat (HC) </span>at [20]–[22]). The Claimants had also exceeded the three-month timeframe for filing a judicial review application (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat (HC) </span>at [17]). In any event, the materials before the court did not disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the Claimants, which would justify the granting of permission (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat (HC) </span>at [15] and [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 23 December 2022, the Claimants filed CA 2 to appeal against Thean J’s decision. Under the applicable rules of court, the Claimants were required to file the requisite documents for the appeal by 14 March 2023. As they did not do so, CA 2 was deemed withdrawn on 14 March 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Subsequently, on 31 March 2023, the Claimants filed CA/SUM 8/2023 (“SUM 8”) for CA 2 to be reinstated and for an extension of time to file the requisite documents no later than eight weeks following the date on which an application for Mr Kassimatis KC and Mr Fitzgerald KC to be admitted was decided and all consequential matters addressed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 SUM 8 was dismissed by Steven Chong JCA on 25 May 2023 (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat bin Mohamed Sayed and others v Attorney-General</span> [2023] 1 SLR 1437 (“<span class="font-italic">Jumaat (CA)</span>”) at [40]). He agreed with Thean J that OA 480 (and consequently, CA 2) was in essence a challenge against the Claimants’ respective convictions. The correct procedure was therefore for the Claimants to commence a review application under the relevant provisions of the CPC, but the Claimants did not satisfy any of the cumulative requirements mandated under s 394J of the CPC (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat (CA) </span>at [25]–[29]). He also noted that the intended applications for the admission of the Applicants had not yet been filed (see <span class="font-italic">Jumaat (CA) </span>at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 6 June 2023, the Claimants filed SUM 16 for the full court of the Court of Appeal to set aside the decision of Chong JCA, for CA 2 to be reinstated and for consequential orders. On 30 June 2023, the Claimants filed their written submissions for SUM 16. They contended that Chong JCA did not have jurisdiction as a single judge to dismiss SUM 8, and that he had applied the wrong legal principles and did not have a full appraisal of the facts in dismissing SUM 8. It is important to note that their written submissions for SUM 16 state that they will seek a review of the prior decisions of the Court of Appeal (on their convictions) if their current proceedings are successful. This means that they acknowledge that a review application under the CPC is necessary but they contend that they may proceed with an application for judicial review first. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On 11 July 2023, the Applicants filed OA 696. They were directed that there should be one application for each Applicant. Subsequently, OA 696 was amended to remove Mr Fitzgerald KC as an applicant, and he then filed OA 811 on 11 August 2023 as a separate application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Preliminary Objection</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As mentioned above, the Respondents took the Preliminary Objection that neither of the Applicants was allowed to argue his own application. The provisions of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “LPA”) are relevant. The LPA provides a statutory scheme for the admission of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under s 32(1) of the LPA, a person must not practise as an advocate and solicitor in Singapore unless his name is on the roll of advocates and solicitors, and he has a practising certificate in force. Without these qualifications, he is referred to as an unauthorised person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Under s 29(1) of the LPA and subject to any written law, advocates and solicitors have the exclusive right to appear and plead in all courts of justice in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Section 15 of the LPA provides for the admission of a Queen’s Counsel to practise as an advocate and solicitor for the purpose of any one case. This is often referred to as an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. It is not disputed that the reference to Queen’s Counsel will also refer to King’s Counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Section 33 of the LPA makes it an offence for any unauthorised person to act as an advocate and solicitor. However, the Applicants relied on an exception in s 34(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) which states that s 33 does not extend to “any person acting personally for himself or herself only in any matter or proceeding to which he or she is a party” (the “Exception”). In other words, the Applicants accepted that if they addressed the court on the merits of the Applications, they would be acting as advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore before being admitted as such. Their position was that they may nevertheless act as such because they come within the Exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The AG argued that if the Applicants can argue the Applications, they would in effect be arguing as advocates and solicitors before being admitted to do so. This was especially since they would be arguing on the merits of the case in SUM 16 in order to persuade the court to grant the Applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, the Exception refers to litigants-in-person, which the Applicants are not. The Applicants have no substantive legal interest or right to protect, unlike litigants-in-person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The LSS’s argument was similar to the AG’s. The LSS argued that the Applicants would be acting as advocates and solicitors if they made submissions on the Applications. This would circumvent the codified process of <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. In practice, even a person who applies for general admission as an advocate and solicitor in Singapore would require a mover to assist him as the applicant would not have the right of audience. The LSS also argued that the Applicants have no substantive rights to protect and the phrase “in any matter or proceeding to which he or she is a party” in the Exception refers to the underlying matter. In this case, the underlying matters are CA 2 and SUM 16.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Applicants argued that they were acting personally for themselves in the Applications. The matter before the court was neither CA 2 nor SUM 16, but only the Applications for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. While an applicant might be represented by a locally qualified advocate and solicitor, nothing in the LPA compels that position. That construction is supported by observations made by the court in <span class="font-italic">Re Nicholas William Henric QC and another application</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 751 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Henric</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court’s decision and reasons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I upheld the Preliminary Objection and ruled that the Applicants do not come within the Exception. Hence, they were not entitled to address the court on the merits of the Applications. I elaborate on my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The argument of the Applicants on the scope of the Exception meant that it should be construed broadly. So long as counsel was an applicant, he would come within the Exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The arguments of the AG and the LSS meant that the Exception should be construed more narrowly, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the court should consider the underlying matter of an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission, and the applicant must have a substantive legal interest or right that he seeks to protect in the underlying matter. On this point, it was not disputed that each of the Applicants was not making an application to protect his own substantive right but only to act as an advocate and solicitor for someone else. This much was clear even on the face of the respective Applications which seek an order to be admitted to act for the persons named in each Application. Likewise, ss 15(1) and 15(3) of the LPA make it clear that an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> application to be admitted is for the purpose of acting for someone else in any one case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, the court should consider the underlying matter of the Applications. The “matter or proceeding” in the Exception is not just the immediate application. I agreed that to adopt the argument of the Applicants would be to circumvent s 33 of the LPA. It is clear that each Application is for the Applicant to act for someone else. In that sense, neither Applicant is acting “personally for himself” within the meaning of the Exception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 <span class="font-italic">Re Henric</span> was a case in which a litigant had executed an affidavit in support of an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission of a Queen’s Counsel. It appears that one of the arguments raised was that he could not do so, and that the affidavit had to be executed by an advocate and solicitor who was instructing the applicant. There, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) said that the litigant could do so. I set out the relevant part of his judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 I shall now address the points raised by the Attorney-General. I agree that s 21 [of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed)] contemplates an application by a QC and not the litigants in the case in question. It also assumes that there is an instructing solicitor on record but does not make that a necessary feature of every application. There is no requirement in our law that QC must appear only on instructions from a solicitor. Indeed, a QC is admitted under s 21(1) ‘to practise as an advocate <span class="font-italic">and</span> solicitor’. The Legal Profession Act does not prohibit a litigant from acting in person (<span class="font-italic">see</span><span class="font-italic"> s 34(e)</span>). Accordingly, if a litigant chooses to act in person, he or the QC in question may affirm the affidavit specified in s 21(3). The litigant acting in person may also address the court in the way an instructing advocate and solicitor may. If the litigant chooses to affirm the affidavit, he cannot claim to have no or insufficient knowledge of what is required of him in <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admissions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I would mention that the current s 15 of the LPA is the equivalent of s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed), which was considered in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Henric</span>. In my view, that decision did not assist the Applicants. Arguably, it assisted the Respondents instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 First, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Henric</span> did not say that because an instructing solicitor is not necessary, an applicant may address the court in an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. On the contrary, the court said that the litigant acting in person may also address the court in the way an instructing solicitor may. No mention was made of an applicant being able to address the court on the application. The LSS submitted that this was consistent with the Respondents’ position that it was the litigants in the underlying matter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Claimants in the present case) who should be addressing the court, rather than the Applicants. I agreed with the LSS that this was not an inadvertent omission. It suggests that the applicant may not address the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Second, this is reinforced by the last sentence of the extract which warns a litigant-in-person that if he chooses to affirm the affidavit, then he cannot claim to have no or insufficient knowledge of what is required of him in such an application. This warning would have been unnecessary if the applicant himself could address the court on the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third, it is significant that when the court said that the LPA does not prohibit a litigant from acting in person, the court referred to s 34(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed). The substance of that provision is the same as the Exception. In other words, the court construed that provision to refer to a litigant-in-person. That was the point of the Respondents, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> that the provision refers to a litigant-in-person and not an applicant for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In fairness to the Applicants, I mention that the issue of the scope of s 34(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) was not argued in <span class="font-italic">Re Henric</span> and the court had proceeded on the premise that the provision applies to a litigant-in-person. Furthermore, the Applicants did not dispute that the Exception applies to litigants-in-person. The question was whether it also applied to the Applicants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At the hearing of the Preliminary Objection, Mr Kassimatis KC also submitted that the Claimants were not entitled to address the court on the Applications as they were not parties to the same since it was the Applicants who were the litigants-in-person for the purpose of the Applications. However, this was contrary to the holding in <span class="font-italic">Re Henric</span>. As already mentioned, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re Henric </span>acknowledged that the litigant in the underlying matter may address the court on an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. Significantly, the Applicants did not argue that the Exception allowed both the Claimants and the Applicants to submit on the Applications. In my view, the Exception would have to be amended if that effect was intended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the reasons mentioned, I was of the view that the Exception did not apply to the Applicants. I therefore upheld the Preliminary Objection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the applicants should be granted </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ad hoc </span><span class="font-weight-bold">admission</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I turn to address the substantive Applications. As mentioned, the <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission of foreign counsel is provided for in s 15 of the LPA, which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ad hoc admissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15.</span>—(1) Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for the purpose of any one case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) holds —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Her Majesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel;

Overall, it should be remembered that the broad proposition underlying the <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admissions regime is that foreign senior counsel will only be admitted on the basis of <span class="font-italic">need</span>. This connotes a fairly stringent standard which is not satisfied merely by showing that the admission of foreign counsel is desirable or convenient or sought as a matter of choice: <span class="font-italic">Beloff </span>at [42]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The s 15(1) Requirements</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The formal requirements of ss 15(1)(</span>a<span class="font-italic">) and 15(1)(</span>b<span class="font-italic">)</span><span class="font-italic"> of the LPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The first and second requirements in s 15(1) of the LPA are that the Applicants must hold a patent as King’s Counsel, and ordinarily reside outside of Singapore or Malaysia but intend to come to Singapore for the purposes of appearing in the case (pursuant to ss 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–15(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA).

As the Claimants acknowledge in their submissions, the mere fact of being King’s Counsel is insufficient to satisfy this requirement; instead, “[m]ore is required”. The Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Beloff </span>at [56] that the foreign counsel’s qualifications must be <span class="font-italic">relevant </span>to the case which he seeks to be admitted for:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 … As Rajah JA explained in <span class="font-italic">Re Andrews</span> at [39], <span class="font-italic">what this requirement entails is that the foreign senior counsel’s qualifications or experience must be relevant to the issues in the case for which he seeks to be admitted;</span> if, for example, a case involves areas of law that call for specialised learning such as arbitration, insolvency or intellectual property, the foreign counsel must have demonstrable expertise in these areas of law. It follows that when a case involves an area of law in which the jurisprudence is uniquely local, such as where the case turns on the meaning of legislation that has no analogue elsewhere or at least where the counsel concerned has no direct experience with that body of law, it will ordinarily be difficult to satisfy the court that foreign counsel has ‘special qualifications or experience’ for the purpose of that case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Claimants submit that CA 2 raises questions of whether the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA undermine the presumption of innocence that is protected under the Constitution, and whether the presumptions in the MDA should be read to impose a legal or evidentiary burden on the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 SUM 16 likewise raises issues of statutory construction and natural justice. The Claimants contend that the Applicants possess “specialised experience” for the purpose of their case. This would mean criminal law and constitutional law. The focus is on the experience, rather than the qualifications, of the Applicants. Specifically, Mr Kassimatis KC stated on affidavit that he has the following experience: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[7] Since commencing practice as a barrister, my principal practice area has been in the criminal law at the trial and appellate levels. I have appeared in over 230 criminal appeals and quasi-criminal appeals and in numerous criminal trials. Further, I have been appeared in cases involving statutory construction, and with the intersection of the criminal law and procedure and fundamental constitutional rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for Mr Fitzgerald KC, he stated that he has the following experience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[3] On 21 November 1978, I was called to the Bar of England and Wales and become [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] a member of Counsel practicing almost exclusively in criminal law. In addition, in September 1986 I passed the New York Bar, in the United States.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[5] Since commencing practice as a barrister, I have appeared as counsel in appeals in the European Court of Human Rights, the House of Lords and its successor court the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal for England and Wales, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, and before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in appeals – including appeals involving the imposition of the death penalty – from appellate courts in the Caribbean.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the other hand, the Respondents argue that even if the Applicants have special experience in criminal and constitutional matters, they do not have special experience with the MDA or with foreign law that is similar in substance to the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The LSS also argued that the Applicants do not have special experience in criminal and constitutional matters that cannot be found among local counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I address the latter point first. It is true that, ordinarily, foreign counsel is admitted on the basis that such a counsel has experience which is not found among local counsel and that such experience is required in view of the complexity of the case. In the present case, the Claimants do not suggest that the case is so complex that the experience of local counsel is not adequate. However, they say that they cannot obtain the services of local counsel, as I will elaborate later. I am of the view that the requirement for the Applicants to have special experience should be considered in this context and hence the fact that there is local counsel who have adequate experience in the matters in question does not in itself mean that the Applicants do not meet the special experience requirement. Otherwise, a claimant may be denied the services of foreign counsel when local counsel will not act. However, the reason why local counsel will not act for the Claimants needs to be considered and I will address that in the next section when dealing with the question of whether there is a special reason to allow the Applications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As for the argument that the Applicants should have special experience with the MDA or similar foreign law, I am of the view that to require the Applicants to have experience in dealing with the MDA specifically, or similar foreign law, would be too high a threshold to impose. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re Harish Salve and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 345 at [37], it is not necessary for the foreign counsel to have had previous experience with the actual issue under consideration before the Singapore court, as it may otherwise be practically impossible for an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>admission to succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Thus, although the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Beloff</span> did refer at [56] to an example where foreign counsel has no direct experience with a body of law in which the jurisprudence is uniquely local to suggest that such a counsel would not ordinarily meet the requirement of “special qualifications or experience”, this does not mean that foreign counsel must have direct experience with the MDA or with a similar foreign law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, it is important to first understand the issues actually raised by CA 2 and SUM 16. As explained at [13] and [16] above, the threshold issue with the Claimants’ case in OA 480 was whether the Claimants had chosen the wrong route to pursue the reliefs they sought. For the purpose of SUM 16 and/or CA 2, the Claimants will have to persuade the court that they are entitled to proceed with a judicial review application in the circumstances notwithstanding the provisions of the CPC. Otherwise, the Claimants’ case may fail at the outset, and the issue of whether the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA are constitutionally sound will not even arise for the court’s determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In that light, while I accept that the Applicants have special experience to make submissions on the constitutionality of the presumptions in the MDA, the Claimants’ submissions skip a step. The Claimants have to <span class="font-italic">first </span>show that the Applicants also have experience that would aid the Claimants to establish that they are entitled to proceed with a judicial review application to begin with. Only then would it be relevant to consider whether the Applicants have the expertise that is related to the constitutionality of the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Claimants’ initial submissions, however, did not specifically address the question of experience with judicial review applications. Based on the affidavits filed by the Applicants, it appeared that the Applicants’ expertise is primarily in <span class="font-italic">criminal </span><span class="font-italic">and constitutional law</span>, rather than administrative law or judicial review matters. In his affidavit, Mr Kassimatis KC stated that his “principal practice area” is criminal law at the trial and appellate levels. While he did mention having appeared in cases involving “the intersection of the criminal law and procedure and fundamental constitutional rights”, no details of these cases were provided nor was it stated that these cases involved judicial review proceedings. Likewise, Mr Fitzgerald KC stated in his affidavit that he practises “almost exclusively” criminal law, although he did also say that he has appeared as counsel in appeals in various courts. No specific mention was made of experience with administrative law or judicial review proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The initial submissions of the Respondents also did not specifically address the question of the Applicants’ experience with judicial review applications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The question of whether the Applicants have special experience on the issue of whether the Claimants are correct to proceed with a judicial review application (instead of a review application under the CPC) was also not addressed specifically by the parties at the hearing on 23 November 2023. Therefore, I subsequently invited submissions on that question.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In response, the Respondents submit that the Applicants have not established that they have special experience in judicial review cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 However, from the Claimants’ submissions in response to the court’s invitation, I am satisfied that Mr Fitzgerald KC has special experience in cases involving judicial review. He has acted in cases before the House of Lords such as <span class="font-italic">Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Venables </span>[1998] AC 407, which concerned the lawfulness of the Home Secretary’s act of fixing minimum periods of detention to be served by young offenders sentenced to detention at the Queen’s pleasure, and <span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v</span><span class="font-italic"> JJ and others </span>[2008] 1 AC 385, which was a case where a statutory provision providing for certain restrictions on terrorism suspects was declared incompatible with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd 8969). Mr Fitzgerald KC has also acted for judicial review cases in the Caribbean before the Privy Council. On the other hand, I am unpersuaded that Mr Kassimatis KC has special experience in cases involving judicial review. Indeed, the Claimants’ submissions do not argue that he has such experience. The Claimants’ submissions state that he has regularly appeared in cases on appeal to the Victorian Court of Appeal and the High Court of Australia relating to the interpretation and construction of statutes. But that is different from judicial review applications. It is also telling that the Claimants say that his professional experience “differs from that of Mr Fitzgerald” but they argue that the collective experience of the Applicants complement each other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Accordingly, I find that Mr Fitzgerald KC has met all the s 15(1) Requirements, but Mr Kassimatis KC has not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there is a special reason to admit the Applicants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Claimants accept that CA 2 and SUM 16 fall within the prescribed areas of law set out in r 32(1) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, constitutional and administrative law as well as criminal law, and that there must therefore be a special reason for the admission of the Applicants. The Claimants advance two arguments. First, they contend that there is a special reason as CA 2 and SUM 16 concern issues of public importance that extend beyond the facts of their respective cases. Specifically, the Claimants rely on the fact that CA 2 concerns questions of whether the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA are compatible with the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, as noted by V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry PC QC</span> [2013] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Lord Goldsmith</span>”), the mere existence of “macro” issues is insufficient, as otherwise special reason would exist in every constitutional case (at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 Conversely, not all cases of a macro nature may be enough to qualify as a ‘special reason’. This applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> in constitutional matters. It is possible to argue, in criminal cases, that the only person affected is the accused, because it is the accused’s life and liberty at stake, and it is the exact circumstances of his act which will determine the appropriate conviction and sentence. In almost all constitutional matters, however, the challenge mounted will be a challenge to the law at large as the law will have been drafted in a general manner and targeted either at the population at large or at a section of the population. If a ‘special reason’ could be made out simply because it held significant repercussions beyond the individual concerned, then almost invariably every constitutional case would necessarily engage a ‘special reason’. This would wholly defeat Parliament’s aim in adding the area of constitutional and administrative law to the list of restricted areas. As I have already observed, the statutory framework necessitates that a more restrictive approach should be taken towards any of the three areas named in s 32(1) of the Admission Rules. A ‘special reason’ must thus be a reason that is unique to the circumstances of that case rather than one which is inherent in the nature of all constitutional cases. Otherwise, the ‘special reason’ requirement would not <span class="font-italic">restrict</span> the <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission of foreign senior counsel in constitutional and administrative cases, but would <span class="font-italic">expand</span> the scope for such admission.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, the fact that CA 2 and SUM 16 raise issues of public importance does not, without more, satisfy the special reason requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I turn to the second argument advanced by the Claimants. This is that a special reason exists as the Claimants have been unable to find local counsel to represent them. Indeed, this is the main point to support the argument that the special reason requirement has been met. The Claimants submit that they have taken all reasonable steps to secure local counsel but have been unsuccessful, and the matters in CA 2 and SUM 16 are complex and require the assistance of experienced counsel. It may be noted that the availability of counsel is also one of the Notification Matters, and there is therefore an overlap between the special reason requirement and the Notification Matters. However, as the special reason requirement is mandatory, I consider the availability of local counsel under this requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC</span> [2013] 3 SLR 66 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Caplan</span>”), V K Rajah JA observed that special reason <span class="font-italic">may</span> exist where an individual shows that he cannot find any competent local counsel to represent him (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 In my view, the phrase ‘special reason’ in s 15(2) of the current LPA envisages an exceptional case. What is exceptional should be decided based on the facts and circumstances of each case. Ms Kam’s position was that a case must invariably raise significant matters of a macro nature before it can be considered exceptional. While Ms Kam’s suggested approach is likely to be the norm in practice, I would go further. There could well be cases where the interests of an individual or issues pertaining solely to that individual are so out of the ordinary that they require special consideration and, hence, qualify as a ‘special reason’. <span class="font-italic">For example, an individual may be able to establish that his case is exceptional if he can prove that despite all reasonable efforts conscientiously made, he cannot find any competent local counsel to represent him.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 However, Rajah JA’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Re Caplan </span>did not go so far as to say that foreign counsel will be admitted in every instance where an individual is unable to find local counsel to represent him. Rather, the individual must show that there have been <span class="font-italic">reasonable </span>efforts that were <span class="font-italic">conscientiously made</span>. This suggests that the individual who seeks the admission of foreign counsel must detail his/her efforts to secure local counsel with some particularity. As Rajah JA observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Caplan </span>at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 Having clarified who should file affidavits in support of <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission applications, I turn now to another important procedural practice point pertaining to the details of the contents of such affidavits. It is important for the court to have the fullest possible picture of all the relevant facts. In particular, the full details of the party’s efforts in securing local counsel should be presented to the court for the purposes of facilitating the court’s consideration of: (a) the necessity for the services of a foreign senior counsel; and (b) the availability of local Senior Counsel or other local advocate and solicitor with appropriate experience (see [66]–[68] below). The details to be provided should include the nature of the contact between the party and the local counsel who was approached (whether personally or through a third party), the mode of contact (whether in writing, orally over the telephone or in person), the date(s) and duration(s) of the call(s) and/or meeting(s), the venue(s) of the meeting(s), as well as a summary of the discussion(s) held. In addition, the date of the local counsel’s refusal to take on the party’s case and the reasons given should also be set out in detail. This list is by no means exhaustive, and solicitors should endeavour to ensure that all relevant details are presented to the court and are supported by relevant documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Further to this requirement, the <span class="font-italic">reasons</span> why the party’s efforts in securing local counsel have been unsuccessful are also relevant in determining whether the case is one where foreign counsel should be admitted. When the Claimants say that they could not get local counsel to act for them, this might give the impression that there is merit in their overall case, but local counsel are either afraid to act for the Claimants or are not prepared to do so <span class="font-italic">pro bono</span>, unlike the Applicants, or that local counsel are otherwise uninterested in assisting the Claimants. However, this impression would be misleading if the reason why the Claimants have not been able to engage local counsel is because there is no merit in the overall case. If this is so, I agree with the LSS that it would be incongruous to allow foreign counsel to be admitted when local counsel are of the view that there is no merit on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the present case, Datchinamurthy’s sister (“Rani”) contacted 15 lawyers from 11 different law firms via e-mail. Based on the e-mails exhibited in the Claimants’ affidavit, it appears that Rani had contacted these lawyers in September 2022. Six lawyers responded stating that they were unable to act for the Claimants. Two of these lawyers explained that they were unable to act due to a lack of capacity, while one stated that he was of the view that the first prayer in OA 480 “may well be moot” as the Court of Appeal had already held in<span class="font-italic"> Gobi a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 180 that the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA are evidential rather than legal presumptions. In any event, that lawyer stated that he was unable to act due to a lack of capacity. The remaining nine lawyers (out of the 15 lawyers contacted) did not respond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Significantly, the Claimants’ friends had approached two lawyers from another law firm, Mr Harpreet Singh Nehal SC (“Mr Nehal SC”) and Mr Damien Chng (“Mr Chng”), who stated that they were unable to act as they were of the view that “the facts of the [Claimants’] cases are such that the pending challenge has no merit”. The important part of the lawyers’ response states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are firmly of the view that, while there is a good arguable case that the use of double presumptions to secure a conviction under the Misuse of Drugs Act impermissibly infringes upon the presumption of innocence, on the facts of the 4 cases, the double presumption was either not used or did not need to be used by the Court to secure the convictions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… to make it absolutely clear - it is not our position that we will only be prepared to act if the merits are ‘<span class="font-italic">strong</span>’. In our view, the facts of the 4 cases are such that the pending challenge has no merit. We do not think it is even fairly arguable that the convictions in the 4 pending cases were based upon the use of double presumptions. Even if one could argue that the High Court did use the double presumption, the admissions/ totality of the evidence in the cases also persuades us that the Court did not in fact need to use the double presumption and that a conviction could safely have been made on the evidence without the use of the double presumptions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As we advised during the recent call, we see no prospect of the Court granting any meaningful relief unless the applicants can show that their convictions cannot be upheld without the use of the double presumption.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the legal validity of double presumptions is to be effectively challenged, one has to find a case where the Court had to necessarily rely upon the double presumptions to secure the conviction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It is clear from Mr Nehal SC and Mr Chng’s response that they did not think the matter had any merits on the facts in any event. There is also no suggestion that these local counsel, especially Mr Nehal SC, do not have adequate experience on the issues in question.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 While the views of Mr Nehal SC and Mr Chng do not necessarily represent the views of other local counsel, the reason that they have provided – the lack of merit on the facts explains why they, as local counsel, are unavailable. While the affidavits of the Applicants and the submissions of the Claimants proceed on the premise that there is merit in the challenge on the constitutionality of the presumptions, it is important to bear in mind that the challenge will have to be applied in the present circumstances. The Claimants say that their case relies on the interpretation of the MDA and the Constitution, a comparison of similar legislation and appropriate case law, and the application of the law to the facts in each individual case. However, their written submissions for the Applications do not elaborate on those facts. Likewise, while each of the Applicants asserts in his respective affidavit that each of the Claimants’ cases involves a number of complex legal issues in respect of the MDA, neither of them asserts that if the issues are resolved in favour of the Claimants, this will likely lead to a successful outcome on the facts. While the Claimants suggest that a review application will be made later, there should at least be some elaboration on the eventual outcome to persuade the court that it will not be academic to grant the Applications, especially at such a late stage when the appeals have already been disposed of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Furthermore, in the case of Datchinamurthy, he has already brought an unsuccessful application for review under the CPC and hence he would have to surmount this obstacle. There was no elaboration by the Claimants or in the affidavits of the Applicants as to how he would overcome this specific hurdle.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For completeness, I would mention that to the extent that some local counsel had said that they were not available at the time of inquiry, the Claimants do not appear to have investigated whether these counsel would now be available as the Claimants appear to have done with Mr Kassimatis KC. Apparently at one time, he was not able to act for them but he has become available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Furthermore, the Claimants have been able to access substantive legal assistance, even without formal representation. The AG highlights that the Claimants indicated at a case conference that the originating application, statement of claim and affidavit for OA 480 had been drafted by a Malaysian lawyer. The submissions filed by the Claimants in SUM 8 and SUM 16 were likewise drafted with legal terms and arguments. Clearly, the Claimants were able to contact and liaise with counsel, whether local or foreign, even though they are behind bars. In the circumstances, even if the Claimants are not formally represented by the Applicants, they have access to legal resources. This holds true whether or not the Applications are granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77  As was observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Lord Goldsmith </span>at [29] and [37], the appellate process in Singapore has evolved to focus more on <span class="font-italic">written</span> advocacy than oral advocacy, such that there is less reason to admit foreign counsel for the purpose of orally presenting a case after trial. There is nothing to prevent the participation of foreign counsel in the preparation for the <span class="font-italic">written </span>submissions for an appeal. I am of the view that these observations also apply to CA 2 and SUM 16.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that there is a special reason to grant the Applications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Notification Matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Given that there is no special reason to grant the Applications, it follows that there is no need to consider the Notification Matters. I note that the AG submits that it is not reasonable to admit the Applicants, as doing so would allow the Claimants to further prolong proceedings in an abuse of the court’s process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The AG submits that the Claimants’ conduct thus far suggests that they commenced CA 2 and SUM 16 in an abuse of process. As noted earlier at [3] and [9], unsuccessful civil applications were filed after the dismissal of their respective appeals, and OA 480 (and consequently, CA 2) was not the first of such applications. In the case of Datchinamurthy, he has already exhausted the remedy of filing a review application under s 394H of the CPC. Also, the Claimants have not provided any explanation as to why they did not raise their arguments in OA 480 earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I note also that no explanation has been given as to why the issues in respect of the MDA were raised so late when each of the Claimants was represented by counsel at trial and on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 That said, I need not decide whether CA 2 and SUM 16 constitute an abuse of process. Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said in respect of the Applications is to affect the substantive merits of CA 2 or SUM 16.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For the above reasons, I dismiss the Applications. To recapitulate, I find that Mr Fitzgerald KC has met all the s 15(1) Requirements but not Mr Kassimatis KC.

Subsequently, on 22 August 2022, the Claimants filed HC/OA 480/2022 (“OA 480”) seeking permission to commence judicial review proceedings. This was on the basis that ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA, which provide for the presumptions of possession and knowledge respectively, were incompatible with the presumption of innocence that is protected under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (2020 Rev Ed).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 OA 480 was dismissed by Valerie Thean J on 25 November 2022.

She held that if there was proper reason to reconsider the Claimants’ convictions, the proper forum to do so was a review application under s 394H of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), but the Claimants did not meet the requirements under the CPC for commencing a review application.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On 23 December 2022, the Claimants filed CA 2 to appeal against the decision of Thean J.

After the Applications were heard on 23 November 2023, the court invited further submissions on a question, ie, whether the Applicants have special experience on the issue of whether the Claimants are correct to proceed with a judicial review application (instead of a review application under the CPC), which were filed on 12 January 2024. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision of the court </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">The Preliminary Objection</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Section 32(1) of the LPA provides that a person who is not on the roll of advocates and solicitors, or who does not have in force a practising certificate, is an “unauthorised person”. Section 33 of the LPA makes it an offence for any unauthorised person to act as an advocate and solicitor. The Applicants’ position was that they did not fall foul of these provisions, as they came within an exception in s 34(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the LPA which states that s 33 does not extend to “any person acting personally for himself or herself only in any matter or proceeding to which he or she is a party” (the “Exception”).

It is clear that each Application is for the Applicant to act for someone else.

The court in that case did not state that an applicant may address the court in an application for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission, and instead said that it was the litigant-in-person who may address the court. The court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Henric </span>also construed s 34(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed), which is identical in substance to the Exception, to refer to a litigant-in-person rather than an applicant for <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission. Significantly, the Applicants did not argue that the Exception allowed both the Claimants and the Applicants to submit on the Applications. The Exception would have to be amended if that effect was intended.

It is only if all these requirements are met that the court will proceed to consider the further matters specified in the Legal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notification 2012 (collectively, the “Notification Matters”): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[40]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[44]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 In the present case, the Respondents accept that the s 15(1) Requirements that the Applicants must hold a patent as King’s Counsel, and ordinarily reside outside of Singapore or Malaysia but intend to come to Singapore for the purposes of appearing in the case (pursuant to ss 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA), are met: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[46]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 In relation to the requirement of special qualifications or experience pursuant to s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the LPA, the court accepts that the Applicants have special experience to make submissions on the constitutionality of the presumptions in the MDA. However, there was a threshold issue with the Claimants’ case in OA 480 which was whether the Claimants had chosen the wrong route to pursue the reliefs they sought. The Claimants would have to persuade the court that they are entitled to proceed with a judicial review application in the circumstances notwithstanding the CPC. While Mr Fitzgerald KC has special experience in cases involving judicial review, the requirement of special qualifications or experience was not satisfied in respect of Mr Kassimatis KC: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">56]–[63]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The Claimants accept that CA 2 and SUM 16 fall within the prescribed areas of law set out in r 32(1) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, constitutional and administrative law as well as criminal law, and that there must therefore be a special reason for the admission of the Applicants. Nevertheless, they have failed to show that a special reason exists. The Claimants submit that there is a special reason as CA 2 and SUM 16 concern issues of public importance that extend beyond the facts of their respective cases. However, the mere existence of “macro” issues is insufficient, as otherwise a special reason would exist in every constitutional case. The fact that CA 2 and SUM 16 raise issues of public importance does not, without more, satisfy the special reason requirement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">64]–[65]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The Claimants contend that a special reason also exists as they have been unable to find local counsel to represent them. However, the reason why their efforts in securing local counsel have been unsuccessful is relevant. The Claimants disclosed one explanation given by local counsel who were prepared to act in principle and were of the view that there was a good arguable case on the issues raised about the MDA, but decided not to act only because of a lack of merit on the facts of the case. It will be incongruous to allow foreign counsel to be admitted when local counsel are of the view that there is no merit on the facts and there is no suggestion that these local counsel do not have adequate experience: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">66]–[72]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 It is important to bear in mind that the Claimants’ challenge on the law will have to be applied to the facts. However, the Claimants have not elaborated on how their challenge on the law, if successful, would likely lead to a successful outcome on the facts. There should at least be some elaboration on the eventual outcome to persuade the court that it will not be academic to grant the Applications, especially at such a late stage when the appeals have already been disposed of: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">73]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The Claimants have been able to access substantive legal assistance, even without formal representation. The documents for OA 480 had been drafted by a Malaysian lawyer, and the submissions filed by the Claimants in SUM 8 and SUM 16 were likewise drafted with legal terms and arguments. In the circumstances, even if the Claimants were not formally represented by the Applicants, they have access to legal resources. The appellate process in Singapore has also evolved to focus more on written advocacy than oral advocacy, and there is nothing to prevent the participation of foreign counsel in the preparation for the written<span class="font-italic"> </span>submissions for an appeal. This applies to CA 2 and SUM 16: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">76]–[77]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 In all the circumstances, there is no special reason to grant the Applications. As there is no special reason to grant the Applications, it follows that there is no need to consider the Notification Matters: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[78]</span><span class="font-weight-bold">–[79]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 The court therefore dismisses the Applications: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">83]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
