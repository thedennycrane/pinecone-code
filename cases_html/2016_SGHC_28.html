The action was made on behalf of certain subsidiary proprietors in respect of building defects, relying on Section 85(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”). The construction of the Development commenced sometime in 2005 and was completed in 2008. The Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) for the Development was issued in two stages—on 22 April 2008 and 28 May 2008—and the Certificate of Statutory Completion (“CSC”) was issued on or about 24 December 2008.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Against Mer Vue, the Plaintiff brought claims for alleged defects in the Development:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in contract, for breach of the sale and purchase agreements with the subsidiary proprietors who were the original purchasers (“Sale and Purchase Agreements”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in tort, for failing to ensure proper design and construction of the Development; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) for breach of statutory duty under the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The issue at hand arose from the Plaintiff’s proposed amendments in Summons No 3193 of 2015 (“SUM 3193”). In this summons, the Plaintiff sought to amend its “Further and Better Particulars of the Statement of Claim filed pursuant to the 1st Defendants’ letter dated 12 October 2011” (“F&amp;BPs”) filed on 31 October 2011 to include the names of an additional 113 subsidiary proprietors (to the initial list of 30 names) in Schedule 1 of its F&amp;BPs. The Plaintiff’s application was dismissed by Assistant Registrar Chong Chin Chin (“AR Chong”) on 31 July 2015. I heard the Plaintiff’s appeal against AR Chong’s decision on 19 October 2015 on this matter and dismissed the appeal. I found that the Plaintiff’s proposed amendments were time-barred and were thus not permitted. I granted the Plaintiff’s application in Summons No 5228 of 2015 for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 16 November 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Representative capacity of MCST as the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 This issue dealt with the characterisation of the Plaintiff’s application under the rules of civil procedure in light of the Plaintiff pursuing the suit in a representative capacity as a management corporation, on behalf of subsidiary proprietors, under Section 85(1) of the BMSMA. Section 85 of the BMSMA was ported from and based on the since-repealed Section 116 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“LTSA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 For the ease of reference, I reproduce Section 85 of the BMSMA (which is for our purposes largely <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with Section 116 of the LTSA with the exception of edits to incorporate the two-tier management corporation scheme):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Management corporation, etc., may represent subsidiary proprietors in proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">85.—(1) Where all or some of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in a parcel comprised in a strata title plan are jointly entitled to take—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) proceedings for or with respect to the common property in that parcel against any person or are liable to have such proceedings taken against them jointly; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) proceedings for or with respect to any limited common property in that parcel against any person or are liable to have such proceedings taken against them jointly,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the proceedings may be taken by or against the management corporation in the case of paragraph (a), or the subsidiary management corporation constituted for that limited common property in the case of paragraph (b), as if it were the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any judgment or order given or made in favour of or against the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation in any such proceedings shall have effect as if it were a judgment or an order given or made in favour of or against the subsidiary proprietors.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where a subsidiary proprietor is liable to make a contribution to another subsidiary proprietor in respect of a judgment debt arising under a judgment referred to in subsection (2), the amount of that contribution shall bear to the judgment debt —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the same proportion as the share value of the lot of the first-mentioned subsidiary proprietor bears to the aggregate share value, in the case of a judgment or an order for or against a management corporation; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the same proportion as calculated in accordance with section 81, in the case of a judgment or an order for or against a subsidiary management corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 A line of local cases have authoritatively held that Section 116(1) of the LTSA, which was taken with amendments made from Section 147 of the New South Wales Strata Titles Act 1973, procedurally facilitates the institution of actions by or against subsidiary proprietors by allowing management corporations to institute or defend actions on their behalf. This is done in a representative capacity, and the statutory provision does not confer a separate right or cause of action on the management corporation. Management corporations relying on this procedural provision would still have to demonstrate an <span class="font-italic">underlying substantive cause of action</span> on the part of the subsidiary proprietors they represent: see <span class="font-italic">MCST</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 2297 v Seasons Park Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 613 (“<span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14]–[18] where the Court of Appeal also referred to relevant observations by G P Selvam J and Lai Siu Chiu J in<span class="font-italic"> MCST </span><span class="font-italic">Plan No 1279 v Khong Guan Realty Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 527 and<span class="font-italic"> MCST Plan No 1938 v Goodview Properties Pte Ltd</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 861 (“<span class="font-italic">Goodview Properties</span>”) respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Thus, where the underlying cause of action is a <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> claim, a management corporation bringing a claim on behalf of its subsidiary proprietors must specify “on which of the subsidiary proprietors’ behalf is the action in contract instituted [as] [t]he substantive party is not the management corporation but the specific subsidiary proprietors” (<span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]). Another important reason for this (other than to enable the defendant to know which subsidiary proprietors authorised the management corporation to bring the action and to know as to whom the eventual judgment would bind) is the rule of abatement as enunciated by the Court of Appeal in the appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Goodview Properties</span> in [2000] 3 SLR(R) 350 at [32] and applied again in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> (at [29]–[32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 This rule of abatement flows from the principle of privity of contract as well as the fact that each subsidiary proprietor is only a tenant-in-common of the common property to the extent of his share value in the development. Thus, under Section 85(1) of the BMSMA, a management corporation can only sue in contract on behalf of its subsidiary proprietors who have had direct sale and purchase contracts with the developer and claim only a <span class="font-italic">proportionate</span> part of the damages suffered in respect of defects to common property. Damages awarded to the management corporation would thus “abate corresponding to the ratio that the collective share value of the units owned by subsidiary proprietors of the units on whose behalf the action was taken bore against the total share value of all the units in the development” (<span class="font-italic">Seasons Park </span>at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In the present case, it is thus not surprising that the Plaintiff sought to include more subsidiary proprietors in its F&amp;BPs. By its own estimation, this would increase the potential damages awarded for a successful contractual claim from 5% to 25% of the eventual damages assessed.

Out of the 113 additional subsidiary proprietors proposed by the Plaintiff to be included in its F&amp;BPs, 33 were not original purchasers of their apartment units and thus had no direct Sale and Purchase Agreements with Mer Vue.

</div> These 33 subsidiary proprietors therefore had no causes of action in contract against Mer Vue; the Plaintiff clearly could not bring a contractual action on their behalf in the first place. The Plaintiff themselves accepted this point.

</div> In addition, I did not find that the original purchasers’ agreements with Mer Vue conferred upon subsequent purchasers any right to sue in contract pursuant to Section 2(1) of Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application did not amount to adding new parties for the purposes of O 15 r 6</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Mer Vue contended that the Plaintiff’s application to represent additional subsidiary proprietors was an attempt to add new parties to the existing action, akin to an application for joinder of parties under O 15 r 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). Here, Mer Vue essentially argued that the Plaintiff was asking the court to intervene to make the additional 113 subsidiary proprietors parties to the action, in which case the Plaintiff should have proceeded under O 15 r 6 and not under O 20. However, I found that this interpretation of the application was misconceived and that it did not comport with the nature of representative proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Who are “parties” to an action? At least under the scheme of O 15 r 6, “parties” are envisaged as those whose names are reflected on the Writ of Summons (or Originating Summons). Thus, O 15 r 8(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC requires the writ (or any other originating process) to be amended to include the new party’s name for orders made under O 15 r 6 to join any person as a party to the action. In contrast, the names of subsidiary proprietors that management corporations sue on behalf of are not reflected on Writs or Originating Summonses as plaintiffs, but are specifically identified in, for example, an annex to the Statement of Claim (as the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> at [18] indicated) or in this case, in the Plaintiff’s F&amp;BPs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The non-applicability of O 15 r 6 is also apparent when one considers the nature and capacity of persons representing and represented in such actions. When management corporations bring actions on behalf of subsidiary proprietors, the former are the named plaintiffs and the latter as represented persons are not deemed to be “parties” before the court.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>This can be analogised to the nature of represented persons in representative proceedings under O 15 r 12, where represented persons are similarly not “parties” before the court (as the Court of Appeal opined in <span class="font-italic">Koh Chong Chiah and others v Treasure Re</span><span class="font-italic">sort Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1204 at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Even if I were to be wrong on this and the Plaintiff’s application should have been characterised as a joinder of parties under O 15 r 6, the right to apply for joinder of parties under O 15 r 6 is still subject to the law of limitation (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffer</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Fathil v Chua Kwang Yong </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1056 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffer</span>”) at [16] and <span class="font-italic">Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd</span> [1987] AC 189). As the relevant time period for limitation had already expired by the time the application was made (see below at [25]–[41]), the Plaintiff’s application would still not succeed under O 15 r 6 of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application essentially made to amend pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Essentially, the Plaintiff’s application to amend its F&amp;BPs was an application to amend pleadings under O 20 r 5 of the ROC. It is instructive that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park </span>(at [27]–[28]) had referred to the motion seeking leave to include names of subsidiary proprietors who had authorised the appellant-management corporation to pursue a contractual claim as one that sought to “amend the pleadings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It has been settled that O 20 r 5 sets out “two distinct schemes of practice” for the amendment of writs and pleadings, dependent on whether the relevant limitation period has expired or not (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Swan v Lim Jee Tee and another </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 940 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Swan</span>”) at [12]–[19]). Where limitation has not set in, amendments may be made under O 20 r 5(1) generally. On the other hand, the court can only grant leave to amend after the limitation period has expired if the amendments fall <span class="font-italic">strictly</span> under any of the three situations in O 20 rr 5(3), 5(4) or 5(5) read with r 5(2). Outside of the three situations, the court has no general power to amend when the defence of limitation would be available to the defendant. In the first place, these three situations are instances where the court merely corrects and makes “explicit what is implicit” on the matters of “identity, capacity or cause of action” that were already asserted or implied from the inception of the writ or the filing of the pleading (<span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Swan</span> at [19]), and hence they do not prejudice the substantive rights of parties under the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“LA”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application did not amount to adding new causes of action under O 20 r 5(5)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Plaintiff’s arguments hinged on whether its application amounted to adding new causes of action. It was submitted that the relevant governing provision for amending pleadings not amounting to adding causes of action was O 20 r 5(1) (since the question of limitation would not even arise) while that for the converse was O 20 r 5(5). The Plaintiff relied on the reasoning as expressed by Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Geocon Piling &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Multistar Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1215 (“<span class="font-italic">Geocon Piling</span>”), where these four questions were set out at [115]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does the plaintiff’s proposed amendment add or substitute a new cause of action?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Has the period of limitation applicable to that new cause of action expired?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If so, does that new cause of action arise out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which the plaintiff has already claimed relief in the action?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If so, is it just to grant the plaintiff leave to make the proposed amendment?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Plaintiff thus submitted that the question of whether new causes of action were being added (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by merely including the additional 113 subsidiary proprietors with <span class="font-italic">no </span>change to the nature of the claim and the facts in support of the claim) should be answered <span class="font-italic">before</span> the question of limitation. However, the situation in the present case should be distinguished from that in<span class="font-italic"> Geocon Piling</span>, where the court was embarking on the inquiry of whether new causes of action were being introduced by one <span class="font-italic">existing plaintiff</span> to whom O 20 r 5(5) might apply even if limitation had set in for the proposed new causes of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 O 20 r 5(5) of the ROC reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which <span class="font-italic">relief has already been claimed</span> in the action by <span class="font-italic">the party</span> applying for leave to make the amendment. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 O 20 r 5(5) covers situations where an <span class="font-italic">existing</span> plaintiff adds or substitutes new causes of action, and does not cover situations where a plaintiff seeks to represent more persons. In the present case, the existing “party” in the action would be the Plaintiff representing the already-named 30 subsidiary proprietors. An amendment to add 113 new subsidiary proprietors to be represented by the Plaintiff does not fall within the scope of O 20 r 5(5); such an amendment does not demonstrate the addition or substitution of new causes of action on behalf of the presently represented 30 subsidiary proprietors. The Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Gaffer</span> at [14] that O 20 r 5(5) only applies to where a new cause of action is proposed by an existing plaintiff against an existing defendant, and not where a new defendant is proposed to be added to an existing action. Similarly, adding more represented persons is something quite different from what is contemplated in O 20 r 5(5).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In any case, allowing such an amendment under O 20 r 5(5) would defeat the purpose of limiting the instances where the court (seemingly) circumvents the limitation defence. Adding more represented persons is not “merely a matter of correction to make explicit what is implicit”, but it affects substantively the potential damages to be awarded (see [9]–[10] above). It was definitely not implicit from the original F&amp;BPs that more subsidiary proprietors beyond the listed 30 had authorised the Plaintiff to pursue their contractual claims. Allowing the amendment would amount to unjustly depriving Mer Vue of its accrued statutory defence of limitation, if available, against these 113 new subsidiary proprietors who at this very late stage, well beyond the period of limitation, want to join in the representative action by the Plaintiff. Each of the 113 new subsidiary proprietors added to the existing pool of represented persons by virtue of the amendment would in substance enlarge the size of the claim and the reliefs sought in the present suit against Mer Vue. Mer Vue would be seriously prejudiced by being denied a defence of limitation, which would have been available to Mer Vue had the MCST started a second representative action to represent these 113 subsidiary proprietors pursuant to Section 85(1) of the BMSMA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Thus, unlike what the Plaintiff contended, the analytical framework applicable should not be the one laid out in <span class="font-italic">Geocon Piling</span> (see [19] above), as the matter here fell outside the scope of O 20 r 5(5) and did not involve a determination of whether the four factors or questions in O 20 r 5(2) read with r 5(5) were made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Underlying contractual claims time-barred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As the Plaintiff was seeking to amend pleadings to represent more subsidiary proprietors under Section 85(1) of the BMSMA in relation to their claims in contract, the Plaintiff had to “point to [the] underlying substantive cause[s] of action” against Mer Vue (<span class="font-italic">Goodview Properties </span>at [16], as approved in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park </span>at [17]) with respect to these additional proposed represented persons. Thus, the limitation period with respect to the contractual claims of these additional 113—or 80 to be accurate, after taking into account 33 non-original purchasers with no contractual relation with Mer Vue (see [12] above)—subsidiary proprietors would be relevant in deciding if the court could allow the proposed amendments under O 20 r 5(1) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable provisions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It was argued by the counsel for Mer Vue that the relevant provision under the LA was Section 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of actions of contract and tort and certain other actions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.—(1)  Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, I was of the view that Section 24A(3) of the LA applied instead, as the contractual claim here was an action for damages for breach of duty under the Sale and Purchase Agreements between the original purchasers and Mer Vue. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong v Ow Wah Foong and another </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span>”) at [13]–[15] clarified the relationship between Section 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and Section 24A of the LA: Section 24A carves out certain exceptions to Section 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and, as such, the two cannot apply concurrently. In <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span>, the appellant’s actions framed in breach of contract alleged, among others, breaches of supervision and certification duties by the respondent-architect. Here, the Plaintiff similarly alleged breaches of supervision duties, in addition to breaches of design, maintenance and construction duties by Mer Vue.

</div> Clearly, the subsidiary proprietors would know by then the “factual essence of their complaint”. It was irrelevant whether they had appreciated that what went wrong amounted to a breach of Mer Vue’s duties as a matter of law. Identifying and claiming alleged defects—what more, photographing and recording them—certainly constituted the requisite knowledge under Section 24A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in relation to the <span class="font-italic">type</span> and <span class="font-italic">content</span> of knowledge required. As for the <span class="font-italic">degree</span> of knowledge, I was satisfied that, by mid-October 2009, the extent of knowledge the subsidiary proprietors had was more than reasonable to start time running.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Even if I were to take the requisite knowledge to only vest in the subsidiary proprietors after the Plaintiff’s expert completed his Inspection Report on 19 November 2009 (for which site inspections were undertaken from 29 October 2009 to 5 November 2009), much more than three years had since passed (by 30 June 2015) and the actions in contract would still be time-barred under Section 24A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implications of claims being time-barred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Thus, I disallowed the Plaintiff’s application to amend under O 20 r 5(1) of the ROC since the limitation with respect to the underlying contractual claims had already set in for the additional subsidiary proprietors. This also comported with what the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seasons Park</span> (at [27]) had envisaged in relation to applications to amend pleadings to reflect the names of subsidiary proprietors on whose behalf a management corporation sues:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, it seems to us that <span class="font-italic">unless limitation has set in</span>, there is much to be said in favour of the court granting leave to the appellant to amend the pleadings to properly set out the basis of its claim in contract [by identifying the subsidiary proprietors on whose behalf the appellant was suing], so that the trial of both causes, in contract, as well as in tort, can proceed together as the evidence will be common to both causes. It would not make much sense, <span class="font-italic">if limitation has not set in</span>, to compel the appellant, or the individual subsidiary proprietors with a claim in contract, to institute a fresh action. It would clearly be inexpedient to try the remaining portion of the present action, which is in tort, separately from the new action in contract to be instituted, as the evidence will be common to both. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Once the limitation period for the contractual claims had expired, I would have no power and discretion to allow an amendment under O 20 r 5(1) unless it can be brought under O 20 rr 5(3), 5(4) or (5) read with 5(2). I also noted, for completeness, that the proposed amendments did not fall under any of the three exclusive situations in O 20 rr 5(3), 5(4) or 5(5) read with r 5(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Lastly, I found the explanation (or the lack thereof) provided by the Plaintiff for its delay in filing the application highly unsatisfactory. Among the letters of authorisation signed by the additional subsidiary proprietors that were dated, the earliest were obtained in 2010, with the majority signed by March or April in 2014 and the latest signed on 23 June 2014.

</div> There were no convincing reasons offered to explain why it had taken the Plaintiff one whole year to make its application to reflect these additional subsidiary proprietors. It was also very curious that more than 80 of the additional letters of authorisation were <span class="font-italic">undated</span>.

Thus, authorisation should be obtained from each original purchaser <span class="font-italic">before</span> management corporations can claim and demonstrate that they are representing and suing on behalf of these subsidiary proprietors pursuant to Section 85(1) of the BMSMA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The appeal against AR Chong’s decision in SUM 3193 was thus dismissed, with costs fixed at $3,500 (inclusive of disbursements) awarded to the 1st Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I note that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Geocon Piling</span> has since been affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Multistar Holdings Ltd v Geocon Piling &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGCA 1, with the Court of Appeal issuing grounds of decision to clarify certain aspects of the trial judge’s reasoning. For the avoidance of doubt, I did not consider the reasoning in these grounds in reaching my decision on the matter. The principles explored by the Court of Appeal on what constitutes a “cause of action” were not in play in this case. Nonetheless, I note that the Court of Appeal’s remarks at [61]–[68] in relation to the absence of unfettered discretion under O 20 r 5(1) of the ROC in circumstances where limitation has set in is in line with its previous holding in<span class="font-italic">Lim Yong Swan</span> which I have followed here.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Seow, Kelvin Chia and Jolene Lim (Samuel Seow Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Christopher Chuah, Nikki Ngiam, Ng Pei Yin and Jasmine Low (WongPartnership LLP) for the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
