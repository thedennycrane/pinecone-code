Further, the two Payment Claims No 15 did not fall within the ambit of allowable ‘repeat claims’, such claims could be allowed even after the finalisation of accounts, as they were materially distinct from the two Payment Claims No 14.

For SUM 1738, Kingsford said that the adjudicator failed to consider the differences between Payment Claim Nos 14 and 15 under the 13 August subcontract, namely, that Kingsford had a set-off comprising liquidated damages, the cost of rectification works, back charges for material wastage, and administrative charges for Deli’s failure to adhere to certain rules and failure to provide sufficient code trade personnel.

This was on the basis that the adjudicators did not consider patent errors arising on the face of the materials properly before them. Kingsford argued that it did not file payment responses for both ADs as it thought that the two Payment Claims No 14 were the final payment claims and hence Deli was precluded from filing further payment claims.

The two adjudicators then dealt with the validity of the two Payment Claims No 15 at great length. Both came to the conclusion that the respective Payment Claims No 15 were valid as these were in compliance with s 10 of the SOPA and reg 5 of the SOPA Regulations. In fact, both the adjudicators deliberated on this issue in their ADs very comprehensively: Mr Giam Chin Toon SC in paras 48 to 76 of his AD, and Mr Christopher Chuah in paras 41 to 47 of his AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Kingsford, being dissatisfied with the decisions of both adjudicators on this issue, then brought this action to the court to set aside the two ADs on the exact same grounds of invalidity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I must first emphasise that the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>explicitly stated that the court should not review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision. This is a sound direction as otherwise, the adjudication process will be frustrated by actions of respondents who are dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s decision like in this case. The purpose of the SOPA, which is to allow the claimant to have an expedited process to his claim, will be defeated. This was succinctly explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span> in the following terms (at [66]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The role of the court in a setting-aside action</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Turning now to the court’s role in a setting-aside action, we agree with the holding in [<span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 733]<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the <span class="font-italic">court should not review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision.</span> The court does, however, have the power to decide whether the adjudicator was validly appointed. If there is no payment claim or service of a payment claim, the appointment of an adjudicator will be invalid, and the resulting adjudication determination would be null and void.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Although ADs are only of temporary finality, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vinod Kumar </span><span class="font-italic">Ramgopal Didwania v Hauslab Design &amp; Build Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 1 SLR 890<span class="font-italic"> </span>reiterated<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the AD binds the parties (at [30]–[31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 It would be helpful to begin with a reiteration of the concept of temporary finality, which undergirds the adjudication regime in Singapore. In short, <span class="font-italic">the Act creates an intervening, provisional process of adjudication which, although provisional in nature, is final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined or resolved whether by arbitration or litigation.</span> This generally takes place after the completion of the works and the arbitrator or the court is empowered <span class="font-italic">in that context</span>, to review, open up, and set aside the earlier adjudication determination. But until then, the adjudication determination binds the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 Admittedly, this abbreviated process of dispute resolution is a species of rough justice (<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>”) at [22]). <span class="font-italic">But we tolerate this because it ensures that payments are made upfront.

Any shortcomings in the process is offset by the fact that the resultant decision only has temporary finality in that there remains the possibility of argument and reversal of the adjudicator’s determination after the construction project is completed in another more thorough and deliberate forum (<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> at [22]). We echoed this in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1011 (“<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span>”) at [63] albeit in a slightly different context.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Thus the basic premise is that Kingsford was bound by the two ADs unless it could show that the adjudicators had failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of SOPA that put their jurisdiction in doubt. One of Kingsford’s key challenges was that the two Payment Claims No 15 were invalid as the two Payment Claims No 14 for each subcontract were identified by Deli as the ‘final’ payment claims. Therefore Deli should not have made further payment claims thereafter and the adjudicators should have dismissed both Deli’s adjudication applications. However, I agreed with both the adjudicators that the two Payment Claims No 15 were valid notwithstanding the labelling of Payment Claims No 14 as final claims. This is because the two Payment Claims No 15 were in compliance with s 10 of the SOPA and reg 5 of the SOPA Regulations. I shall now delve deeper into this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As mentioned, Kingsford submitted that the two Payment Claims No 15 were invalid because they were issued after the ‘final’ claims under both subcontracts. The completion date under both subcontracts was 30 April 2016. On 8 December 2016, about seven months after the completion date, Deli issued the two Payment Claims No 14. They were labelled as ‘final’ claims. But about one month <span class="font-italic">after</span> these ‘final’ claims, Deli issued two further payment claims – the two Payment Claims No 15. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Although Kingsford acknowledged that there was no mechanism in the subcontracts to determine which payment claims would be final, it submitted that it would be reasonable to treat the first payment claim following the completion date of the subcontracts as the ‘final’ one. These would be the two Payment Claims No 14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Kingsford did acknowledge that the SOPA allows for ‘repeat claims’ (claims filed after the final payment claim) as long as the final claim was unpaid and had not yet been decided by the adjudicator. However Kingsford argued that the two Payment Claims No 15 were not repeat claims as the items and amount therein were materially different from the two Payment Claims No 14.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Kingsford cited <span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Hoong Adam v GTH Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 4 SLR 615 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Hoong</span>”) to support its argument that the two Payment Claims No 15 were invalid as the two Payment Claims No 14 were labelled as the final payments. This authority was also referred to by Kingsford to the two adjudicators who were not persuaded by Kingsford’s submissions. I was also not convinced by this argument as <span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Hoong</span> is distinguishable from the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 <span class="font-italic">Lau Fook Hoong</span> was an application to set aside an AD on the ground that it was null and void. The court ruled against the applicant and dismissed the application as the applicant failed to furnish security for costs as required under s 27(5) of the SOPA. Thereafter the court went further to examine the provisions of s 10 of the SOPA and the Singapore Institute of Architects’ Articles and Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract) (7th Ed, April 2005) (“the SIA Conditions”) regarding final payment claims. The court stated (at [51]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is, at the very least, arguable, that a payment claim issued at any time after the issuance of the final claim or final payment claim and thus not in accordance with the SIA Conditions 2005 or the SIA Conditions 2011 respectively, is invalid as it failed to comply with s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The relevant provision in the SIA Conditions that the court was referring to provided that the architect would issue a ‘Final Certificate’ within three months of certain documents being received. Therefore any payment claims issued after the ‘final’ claim (being the claim in relation to the Final Certificate) would be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Hoong</span> was that the breach of the SIA Conditions could potentially be a breach of a mandatory provision, namely, s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, since that provision explicitly provides that a payment claim shall be served “at such time as specified in or determined in accordance with the terms of the contract”. In other words, for a breach of a contractual provision to invalidate a payment claim, the SOPA provisions must make reference to the contractual provisions such that a breach of the latter can be said to be a breach of the former. This is also consistent with <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span> which stands for the proposition that the <span class="font-italic">only</span> requirements for the validity of payment claims are compliance with the SOPA mandatory provisions and the SOPA Regulations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In this case, however, Kingsford informed the court that it was not arguing that the SIA Conditions were applicable to the parties in this case. This point was rightly acknowledged because cl 4 of each subcontract did not incorporate the SIA Conditions. That clause stated, “The conditions of this Sub-contract shall comply fully with all terms and conditions as set out in the Main Contract (Singapore Institute of Architect Nine Edition, August 2011)”. This means that Kingsford cannot argue that a breach of the SIA Conditions is also a breach of the SOPA mandatory provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Instead, Kingsford relied on the fact that the two Payment Claims No 14 were labelled as final payment claims by Deli to found its claim that the two Payment Claims No 15 were invalid. But nothing in the subcontracts provides for final payment claims. Indeed, cll 5.1 to 5.4 of each subcontract prescribes the procedure for making payment claims between the parties. But they did not provide for any mechanism for determining which payment claims were ‘final’, and the effect of deeming such payment claims ‘final’. As the two Payment Claims No 15 did not contravene these contractual terms, Kingsford’s argument could not stand. The contractual terms in this case were entirely unlike the SIA Conditions in <span class="font-italic">Lau </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Hoong</span>, which specifically provided for the provision of a ‘Final Certificate’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Accordingly, I dismissed Kingsford’s claim and found that the two Payment Claims No 15 were valid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Kingsford further submitted that there was a breach of natural justice as the adjudicators did not give it an adequate opportunity to be heard by disregarding its arguments that it had a valid set-off and counterclaim against Deli’s two Payment Claims No 15.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Kingsford relied on back charges to say that it had a right to set-off Deli’s claims. It submitted that these back charges were referred to in the two Payment Claims No 14, which were documents placed before the adjudicators. According to Kingsford, when the adjudicators considered the issue of the validity of the two Payment Claims No 15, they had made references to the two Payment Claims No 14 but they failed to consider the back charges referred to within. Kingsford submitted that the adjudicators should have taken these back charges into account even though Kingsford failed to file its payment responses. This is because natural justice requires the adjudicators to consider whether there were patent errors, which included the purported back charges. In support of this proposition, Kingsford cited<span class="font-italic"> W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>”) at [51]. I set out this quote in its proper context (at [51]–[52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 With respect, we do not think this is correct. In our judgment, under s 17(3) of the Act, even where <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no response has been filed, an adjudicator must make a determination, and in doing so, it is incumbent on him to consider the material which is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">properly before him</span> and which he is permitted and, indeed, obliged to consider. In such circumstances, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is nothing to stop a respondent who has failed to file any payment response or adjudication response from raising patent errors</span> on the face of the material <span class="font-italic">properly</span> before the adjudicator to contend that the payment claim should not be allowed in part or at all. We reiterate that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">such errors must be plain and evident on the face of the material that is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">properly before the adjudicator</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 In our judgment, an adjudicator is bound to consider the payment claim before him and cannot make his determination as if the fact that the respondent has not filed a response obviates the need for him to consider the material properly before him. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The adjudication does not become a mere formality. The adjudicator is obliged to adjudicate</span>, and in discharging this obligation, he must consider the material properly before him and make an independent and impartial determination in a timely manner …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  With due respect, Kingsford’s counsel had misunderstood <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>. It is true that the Court of Appeal directed that the adjudicator should not approve the claimant’s payment claim as a mere formality or rubber stamp the claim in situations where there is no payment response. However, in doing so, the Court of Appeal did not say that the adjudicator had to act as though the payment response was present. Rather, the adjudicator was entitled to look only at the materials properly before him and make his determination based on such materials. This excludes the payment response, since it had not been filed by the respondent and therefore was not <span class="font-italic">properly</span> before the adjudicator. However, the respondent was still entitled to make arguments based on the materials which were before the adjudicator and point out “patent errors” on the face of the materials. For instance, if the documentary evidence submitted by the claimant plainly contradicted its claimed amount, the respondent would be entitled to point that out to the adjudicator. Indeed, this accords with the plain and simple meaning of “patent” under the Oxford Dictionary which refers to something that is “easily recognisable” or “obvious”. Hence, the adjudicators in this case had to spot obvious and clear cut errors in the payment claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 While the adjudicators could consider “patent errors” relating to the payment claims, they could go no further lest they contravened s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA. Section 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The respondent shall not include in the adjudication response, and the adjudicator shall not consider, any reason for withholding any amount, including but not limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and set-off, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) where the adjudication relates to a construction contract, the reason was included in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant; or</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The subcontracts in this case were construction contracts. Since Kingsford had failed to file its payment responses, pursuant to s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, the adjudicators were precluded from considering Kingsford’s arguments on its purported set-off or counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, as mentioned above, the adjudicators could consider “patent errors” relating to the payment claims. They did indeed do so and varied the payment claims accordingly. This can be found in Mr Giam Chin Toon SC’s AD at paras 77 to 152 where he went through the items in the payment claim line by line and eventually reduced the payment claim amount drastically from $419,599.16 to $251,455.41. Mr Christopher Chuah also deliberated on the payment claim at paras 48 to 67 of his AD and concluded that Deli’s claims were all “sufficiently substantiated”.

</div>
</div> In fact, both adjudicators even went so far as to consider Kingsford’s claims relating to the back charges and set-off, but they rightfully precluded these claims as these were not in the payment responses and were therefore disallowed by s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Accordingly, I found that the adjudicators did not breach natural justice in arriving at their conclusions in the ADs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on the challenge to the ADs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Kingsford had repeatedly tried to set off Deli’s legitimate claims. It did so twice before two separate adjudicators and once before this court. The arguments in all the three fora were the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I was satisfied that the two Payment Claims No 15 were valid payment claims as these were made in accordance with the SOPA, the SOPA Regulations, and the subcontracts. There was also no breach of natural justice when the adjudicators did not consider Kingsford’s back charges and set-off in their deliberations. This was because Kingsford failed to lodge its payment responses and s 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA forbade the adjudicators from taking cognisance of these claims. This appeal was unmeritorious and the applications to set aside the ADs had to be dismissed with fixed costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stay of execution pending appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  When the applications were dismissed, Kingsford immediately applied for the order to be stayed pending its appeal. Kingsford further informed the court that it had taken arbitral proceedings against Deli.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Deli resisted this application. I agreed that there should not be any further delay of the payment claims. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>held that a successful claimant was entitled to receive the adjudicated amount quickly and could not be denied payment without good reason. This was explained at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 … [T]he purpose of the Act is to ensure (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) that <span class="font-italic">even though adjudication determinations are interim in nature, successful claimants are paid</span>. To this end, under s 22(1), the respondent must pay the adjudicated amount either within seven days after being served with the adjudication determination (see s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), or by the deadline stipulated by the adjudicator (see s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). The claimant can suspend work (see s 26(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)) or take a lien on goods supplied (see s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)) if the respondent fails to pay. If the respondent intends to apply for a review of the adjudication determination, he must first pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant: see s 18(3). If the respondent wants to set aside the adjudication determination, he must pay into court as security the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount: see s 27(5). This requirement is repeated in O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). These provisions all point to one thing: <span class="font-italic">where a claimant succeeds in his adjudication application, he is entitled to receive the adjudicated amount quickly and cannot be denied payment without very good reason.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 However, the Court of Appeal did explain that there could be instances where the claimant would not be allowed to receive payment (by staying the enforcement of an AD). First, if there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual insolvency. Secondly, if the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered when the dispute between the parties was finally resolved in the respondent’s favour. This was stated at [70]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 In our judgment, <span class="font-italic">a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination may ordinarily be justified where there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency, or where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour by a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Further, we agree with HHJ Coulson QC in <span class="font-italic">Derek </span><span class="font-italic">Vago</span> that a court may properly consider whether the claimant’s financial distress was, to a significant degree, caused by the respondent’s failure to pay the adjudicated amount and, also, whether the claimant was already in a similar state of financial strength or weakness (as the case may be) at the time the parties entered into their contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 But in order to strike a balance between the two concerns set out above (namely, the claimant’s entitlement to receive quick payment, and the respondent’s entitlement to recover the money upon subsequent dispute resolution), the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> further emphasised at [71] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a stay will not <span class="font-italic">readily</span> be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the Act, which is precisely to avoid and guard against pushing building and construction companies over the financial precipice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, the overall objective of the SOPA, which is to ensure cash flow in the construction industry, should ultimately be given more weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It appears that Kingsford was unwilling to allow Deli to have the benefit of the money that was paid into court despite the ADs and the dismissal of the applications to set aside the ADs. It also commenced further arbitral proceedings against Deli. This is similar to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Hyundai Engineering</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Construction Co Ltd v International Elements Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 626, where the court ordered that the money paid into court be released to the defendant even though the matter was pending appeal (at [45]). The court reasoned that there was no express provision in the SOPA governing the release of monies paid into court pending appeal, but that any such requirement would need to be consistent with the “overarching purpose of ensuring the flow of liquidity in the construction industry through the provision of an expeditious means of resolving payment disputes” (at [42]). In other words, the purpose of the SOPA militates in favour of releasing the monies paid into court pending appeal. I agreed and adopted the same reasoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Indeed, the court decried such an attempt to avoid payment in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh (alias Aster Lim) v TS Ong Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 11. The issue there was not strictly a review of the AD but rather was about the non-payment of a judgment debt, although the judgment debt originated from an AD under the SOPA. Foo Chee Hock JC noted that the SOPA was premised on successful claimants being paid speedily, and concluded that such attempts to avoid payment of judgment debts were an abuse of the court process (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… parties should not be allowed<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>to withhold payment of the adjudicated sum whilst seeking to effectively overturn the adjudication determination at the same time. The Plaintiff’s attempt to withhold payment while using Suit 92 to overturn the Adjudication Determination must be construed as an abuse of the process of the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, I ordered that the sums paid into court be released to Deli forthwith.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Luo Ling Ling (Aequitas Law LLP) for the respondent in OS 362/2017 and for the applicant in OS 460/2017;<br/>Swah Yeqin, Shirin and Chong Kuan Keong (Chong Chia &amp; Lim LLC) for the applicant in OS 362/2017 and for the respondent in OS 460/2017.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
