</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For the purposes of this judgment, I shall focus on the first defence raised by McTrans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Shortly after the commencement of the 2009 Suit, nearly 84% of the Cargo (“Group A Cargo”) was returned to the cargo owners. 16% of the Cargo remained in McTrans’ possession (“Group B Cargo”). A separate application was made for a further 13 plaintiffs, who were owners of the Group B Cargo, to be added to the 2009 Suit. This was done on 20 January 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The injunction application was eventually restored for hearing. At the resumed hearing, it was recorded that, by consent of the parties, no order be made on the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The trial for the 2009 Suit was heard over 20 days from October 2011 to February 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The grounds of decision in the 2009 Suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In her grounds of decision released on 30 July 2012 (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and oth</span><span class="font-italic">ers v McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 250 (“Ang J’s decision”)), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J first stated at [44] that to succeed in a claim for conversion, the plaintiff must show that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It has actual possession of, or the right to immediate possession of, the chattel converted; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The right to sue for conversion existed at the time of the conversion; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant acted in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff’s superior possessory title. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Ang J found that the Plaintiffs were responsible for sending back the Cargo to Singapore after the carriers could not deliver the Cargo to Indonesia, as the Plaintiffs were head bailees under the door-to-door service agreement with their customers, and were entitled, if not obliged, to protect and preserve the Cargo. The 1st Defendant and the 8th Defendant had acknowledged the Plaintiffs’ rights and interests in the Cargo (at [56]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Ang J further found that the Plaintiffs had initially appointed the 8th Defendant (whom Hari believed was the 1st Defendant’s company) as their receiving agent to make the necessary arrangements for customs clearance of the Cargo and other services for which the Plaintiffs had undertaken responsibility <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> their customers. The 8th Defendant was a sub-bailee of the Plaintiffs (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 After permission to ship back the Cargo was obtained, it was incumbent upon the 8th Defendant to ensure that the Cargo was properly consigned to the 1st Plaintiff, and not unilaterally sent to a different consignee (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, by reason of the unauthorised switch of the name of the consignees in the Bills of Lading, the sub-bailment between the Plaintiffs and the 8th Defendant ended, and the right to possession re-vested in the Plaintiffs as the head bailees <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> their customers. By contrast, McTrans, as the named consignee on the bill of lading, merely had a bare possessory title to the Cargo. The Plaintiffs, which stood in a bailor-bailee relationship with their customers, had a superior possessory title to the Cargo as compared to McTrans, with a right to the immediate possession of it. The Plaintiffs therefore had standing to bring the action in conversion against McTrans (at [57]–[61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Further, Ang J rejected McTrans’ defence that it was a mere intermediary carrying out its principal’s (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the 8th Defendant’s) instructions without notice of any of the competing claims. Instead, Ang J found that McTrans knew at all material times that the Plaintiffs were entitled to the Cargo and that the 8th Defendant had no authority to give lawful instructions in relation to the Cargo. McTrans nevertheless assisted the 8th Defendant to interfere with and undermine the Plaintiffs’ right to immediate possession of the Cargo. McTrans’ acts and conduct were intentional, and had the effect of denying the Plaintiffs of their superior possessory title to the Cargo (at [74]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Insofar as the Plaintiffs were concerned, Ang J granted them a declaration that McTrans was to indemnify them for all liabilities and losses arising from the conversion (at [9]). However, she did not grant them the Transportation Expenses that they had sought, although the reasons for this was not explained (at [155]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I note that Ang J also found that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 2nd Defendant, in whom the 1st Defendant was a director with 70% beneficial interest, provided S$15,000 for McTrans’ legal fees (at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 1st and 3rd Defendants were no strangers to each other. The 3rd Defendant admitted that the 1st Defendant was previously his boss in 1996 or 1997. The 3rd Defendant was also on familiar terms with the 1st, 6th and 7th Defendants (at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Events subsequent to the 2009 Suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 McTrans appealed the whole of Ang J’s decision, arguing that the Plaintiffs had no standing to bring the claim for conversion, and that Ang J erred in finding that the Plaintiffs had an immediate right of possession to the Cargo. On 5 February 2013, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal without written grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On 16 July 2013, the Plaintiffs applied to tax their costs for the 2009 Suit, following which McTrans was ordered to pay them S$858,077.38.

</div> However, its underlying gripe is different from the other Defendants. The 2nd Defendant does not raise any issues relating to the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. Instead, the 2nd Defendant’s case is based on an alleged <span class="font-italic">lack of particularity</span> in the Plaintiffs’ pleadings for the claim in conspiracy to defraud.

These defects in the Plaintiffs’ claims cannot be cured by amendments, as a formal request for further and better particulars (“F&amp;BPs”) had already been made but the F&amp;BPs filed on 8 January 2016 did not add any other substantive factual allegations to clarify the Plaintiffs’ claim against the 2nd Defendant.

He dismissed both applications. In his brief grounds appended to the certified transcript of the hearing, he reasoned that in light of all the circumstances, he could not conclude with any certainty that the present suit constituted an abuse of process. He accepted the Defendants’ arguments that many of the facts relied upon by the Plaintiffs in the present suit were substantially similar, although not perfectly identical, to those presented in the 2009 Suit, and that the Plaintiffs may be said to be trying to recover the same set of losses in both actions (although the causes of action are different).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When the 2009 Suit was commenced, it was not unreasonable for the Plaintiffs to focus on the release of the Cargo converted. The Plaintiffs were merely bailees of Cargo, which was owned by its customers. If the goods were not released in a timely manner, the Plaintiffs might have been liable for resulting damages which would increase the longer the goods were wrongfully retained. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Although the Plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">could </span>have brought the present claims in the earlier proceedings in 2009, it was not unreasonable that the Plaintiffs did not do so. Adding the present claims of fraud and conspiracy would have meant that the 2009 Suit would have taken a longer time to conclude, which was adverse to the Plaintiffs’ interest of having the Cargo released as soon as possible. Further, the present claims of fraud and conspiracy are far harder to prove than that of conversion. It was questionable if the Plaintiffs had sufficient evidence then to commence claims for fraud and conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is no rule against trying to recover a single set of losses from one defendant first and only suing other defendants if that fails. Although it would have been preferable for the claims in the present suit to have been tried together with the claim for conversion, the weight of these considerations must be balanced against the fact that the Plaintiffs should not be prohibited from pressing genuine claims, especially when there were understandable reasons for the Plaintiffs proceeding with the claim for conversion first.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The claim for Transportation Expenses would not amount to a collateral attack on the decision in the 2009 Suit. In the 2009 Suit, while the point is unclear, Ang J most likely approached the claim by awarding expectation damages, so that the Plaintiffs were put in the position they would have been in if the contract for delivery of the Cargo had been properly performed. This may explain why she dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim for Transportation Expenses in the 2009 Suit. But in the present suit, it is not impossible for the trial judge to choose to award a <span class="font-italic">different measure of damages</span> if the claims for fraud and conspiracy are made out. If so, the trial judge in the present suit can award Transportation Expenses without impinging on the propriety of the earlier decision (in which Transportation Expenses were <span class="font-italic">not</span> awarded).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The 3rd Defendant was ordered to pay costs of S$6,000 and a fixed disbursement to the Plaintiffs. An identical cost order was also made against the 4th and 5th Defendants collectively. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SUM 1978/2016: the 1st Defendant’s application to strike out </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On 9 June 2016, the AR heard the 1st Defendant’s application to strike out (SUM 1978/2016) and reserved judgment. At the resumed hearing on 8 July 2016, the AR dismissed the application. The 1st Defendant was ordered to pay the Plaintiffs costs of S$8,000 plus disbursements to be agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On 27 July 2016, the AR issued his written grounds of decision (“GD”) setting out a comprehensive analysis of the issues and legal principles. The GD is recorded in <span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others</span><span class="font-italic"> v Nurdian Cuaca and others</span> [2016] SGHCR 10. In the AR’s GD, he similarly concluded that he could not come to any certain conclusion that the Plaintiffs’ conduct amounted to an abuse of process (at [66]). The AR considered both the public interest and the private interests of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 With regard to the public interest (see [52]–[58]), he held that it was in the wider public’s interest to protect the plaintiffs’ ability to raise unlitigated issues in a court of law. Further, the principle of party autonomy, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Plaintiffs’ ability to decide when and who to sue and over what issues, should be upheld. Third, he reasoned that this was not a case where the failure to bring the later claims was a result of negligence or inadvertence. Instead, the Plaintiffs had made a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> case management decision in 2009 to bring the 2009 Suit only against McTrans, based on the information they had at that time. Further, it was not necessarily more efficient for the additional claims to be brought then, as the 2009 Suit would have been transformed if the claims in the present suit were added, and the complexity, length and cost of proceedings would increase dramatically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As for private interests (see [61]–[69]), the AR held that there was in the present matter no question of the 1st Defendant being “twice vexed”, as he was not a party to the 2009 Suit. The Plaintiffs had good reasons not to bring the present claims then, as the most pressing matter was to try and have the Cargo released; otherwise, the Plaintiffs may potentially be liable to their customers for the non-return of the Cargo. A claim in conversion was the most direct avenue of relief. In addition, the evidence in 2009 in respect of the other claims (in the present suit) was unsatisfactory; it was necessary to bring a further action to obtain further evidence. Although it was not argued by parties, the AR said it was not necessary for the Plaintiffs to have laid all their cards upfront. A failure to put the other party on notice will not necessarily render the subsequent action an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SUM 2021/2016: the 2nd Defendant’s application to strike out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On 9 June 2016, the AR also heard the 2nd Defendant’s application to strike out (SUM 2021/2016). After hearing the 2nd Defendant’s objections on the pleadings, the AR gave the Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend the pleadings and/or F&amp;BPs, and fixed a further hearing on 8 July 2016.

The AR held that the amendments proposed by the Plaintiffs in the amended F&amp;BPs were sufficient to save the claim against the 2nd Defendant. However, he made no order as to SUM 2021/2016, to reflect the fact that the application was not improperly brought by the 2nd Defendant.

As a result of the 2009 Suit, the Plaintiffs were able to gather new evidence showing the connection between various Defendants which surfaced shortly before or during the trial for the 2009 Suit. The Plaintiffs were also able to rely on significant findings in relation to McTrans’ conduct in the events.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if the Plaintiffs could have made a claim against the Defendants, it was reasonable for the Plaintiffs not to have done so earlier but to now commence a separate litigation for these claims. This was a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>case management decision to avoid a lengthy and complex claim. There was no collateral attack by the Plaintiffs on the decision of the 2009 Suit, or harassment of the Defendants. There was thus no abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In response, the 1st Defendant’s main argument is that the same ultimate issues are at the centre of the 2009 and 2015 Suits, namely, whether the Plaintiffs were indeed head bailees of the Cargo (and thus had superior possessory title), and whether there was an unauthorised switch of the Bills of Lading.

</div> Therefore, allowing the present suit to proceed would mean that a different court will need to re-consider the documents and re-assess the evidence of the witnesses, which would result in a duplication of time, costs and efforts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 More importantly, it is entirely possible that the court might assess these differently from Ang J (and the Court of Appeal in the appeal from Ang J’s decision), which would undermine the principle of finality of judicial determination. Instead, there would be a risk of inconsistent judgments, which would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This is especially given that Ang J had already made findings that were adverse to the 1st Defendant.

He argues that the Plaintiffs had already made allegations of fraud and/or conspiracy against McTrans in the 2009 Suit and had ample time to add in a cause of action in fraud and/or conspiracy against the 3rd Defendant, as the sales director of McTrans. This is especially because the Plaintiffs were already aware of the 3rd Defendant’s alleged role in the alleged conspiracy to defraud. Further, the present suit arises out of “identical facts” and the current claims were merely an extension of the claims in the 2009 Suit. The remedies sought also significantly overlap with those sought in the 2009 Suit. The 3rd Defendant argues that the Plaintiffs appear to be bringing the present claims in an attempt to recover the same set of losses because they were unable to recover any money from McTrans, which has been wound up.

The test is whether there is a sufficient degree of identity between the two parties to make it just to hold that the decision to which one (A) was party should be binding in proceedings to which the other (B) was party: <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span><span class="font-italic">v Gore Wood &amp; Co</span> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 32, citing <span class="font-italic">Gleeson v J Wippell &amp; Co Ltd </span>[1977] 1 WLR 510 at 515.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In applying the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, it is well-established that the question of whether a litigant should be prevented from taking a point that could have been raised in earlier proceedings is not a “dogmatic” inquiry, but rather, a “broad, merits-based judgment” which takes account of the public and private interests involved as well as all the facts of the case (<span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 31). The focus is on whether, in all the circumstances, a party is abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it an issue which could have been raised before: <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 31, cited in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”) at [52] and <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [104]. In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53], it was stated that the relevant (non-exhaustive) factors the court should consider include: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It should be noted that in relation to factor (a) above, Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>(at 31) disavowed an approach that requires any collateral attack on a previous decision, or some element of dishonesty, before an abuse can be found. However, he added that where those elements are present, the later proceedings would much more obviously be abusive. At the end of the day, the categories of abuse of process are not closed, and what is required is an “intense focus on the facts of the case”: <span class="font-italic">Angeli Luki Kotonou v National Westminster Bank plc </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 1106 (“<span class="font-italic">Kotonou</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Some observations on the Court’s role in applications to strike out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Court’s powers to strike out a claim on the four grounds under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court have been extensively considered and it is not necessary for me to re-state them here. It suffices for me to say that in coming to my decision, I have borne in mind that the Court should only exercise its power to strike out in “plain and obvious” cases. This power is to be exercised with caution, as striking out will have the effect of depriving a litigant of the opportunity to have his claim tried by the court: <span class="font-italic">Kwa Ban Cheong </span>at [29], citing<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">North West Water Ltd v Binnie &amp; Partners</span> [1990] 3 All ER 547 at 553. I am fully cognisant that the role of the Court at this stage is not to carry out a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case: see <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [18] and <span class="font-italic">The “Osprey”</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at [6]. Otherwise, the Court hearing the striking out application would effectively be usurping the proper function of the trial court, and conducting a trial of the case in chambers on affidavits only, without discovery and without evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way: see <span class="font-italic">Ko Teck Siang and another v Low Fong Mei and another and other actions</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 22 at [15], citing <span class="font-italic">Wenlock v Moloney </span>[1965] 2 All ER 871 at 874. Instead, the correct question for the Court to ask is whether the commencement of the present suit constitutes a <span class="font-italic">plain and obvious case</span> of an abuse of the process of the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Bearing in mind the general principles, I turn to the substantive issues in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Does a case management decision to litigate incrementally constitute an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-weight-bold">?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Policy reasons underpinning the extended doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is helpful to begin with a consideration of the broad public policy grounds underpinning the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. As the AR below noted at some length, there are multiple, often competing, policy reasons for the doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Fundamentally, the doctrine aims to bring finality to litigation and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at 31. This serves at least two functions. First, it promotes the <span class="font-italic">public interest</span> of efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation as a whole. It prevents “wasted time and cost, duplication of effort [and] dispersal of evidence”: <span class="font-italic">Kotonou </span>at [50], citing <span class="font-italic">Divine-Bortey v Brent LBC </span>[1998] ICR 886 at 898. Second, it also enhances the <span class="font-italic">private interest</span> of the other party to the proceedings by avoiding oppression and unfair harassment to it: <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 31 and <span class="font-italic">State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Alexander Stenhouse Ltd and another case </span>(1997) Aust Tort Rep 81-423 (“<span class="font-italic">Stenhouse</span>”) at 64,089. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Further, the doctrine aims to avoid bringing the administration of justice into disrepute: <span class="font-italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </span>[1981] 3 All ER 727 at 729; <span class="font-italic">Stenhouse </span>at 64,089. This would occur if the re-litigation constitutes a collateral attack on the outcome of previous proceedings, leading to the risk of an inconsistent judgment especially if “different courts at different times are obliged to examine the same substratum of fact which gives rise to the subject of litigation”: <span class="font-italic">Kotonou </span>at [50]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 However, these aims must be balanced against a party’s indisputable right of access to justice and protection of the law. As observed by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at 59, “[i]t is one thing to refuse to allow a party to relitigate a question which has already been decided; it is quite another to deny him the opportunity of litigating for the first time a question which has not previously been adjudicated upon”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I turn to the case law on the specific question of whether a case management decision by a plaintiff to litigate incrementally constitutes an abuse of process. In this regard, I was not pointed to any local case authority but was directed to three English authorities on point. These cases will be analysed as they may assist the Court in setting out some general principles for future cases in Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The first case is the English House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>. The plaintiff in that case was a businessman who conducted his business through a number of companies, including company W, in which he held most of the shares. As a result of a property transaction that went awry, the plaintiff had causes of action against the defendant, a firm of solicitors that acted for him in the transaction, both personally as well as in the name of company W. As it turned out, the plaintiff chose to sue the defendant in the name of company W first (on 8 January 1991), for professional negligence in connection with the exercise of an option to purchase. On 17 January 1991, solicitors representing company W informed the defendant that the plaintiff had a claim against the defendant in his personal capacity which he would pursue in due course. The claim by company W against the defendant was eventually settled during the trial in late 1992. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 On 7 April 1993, the plaintiff, acting <span class="font-italic">in his personal capacity</span>, issued a writ against the defendant, on the basis that the defendant also owed the plaintiff a duty of care in respect of the exercise of the option. The defendant applied to strike the action out on the ground of abuse of process in December 1997. In one of the plaintiff’s affidavits, he deposed his reasons for not enforcing his personal claims at the initial stage. These included the fact that advancing his personal claim would have substantially delayed the progress and resolution of company W’s action against the defendant, and that the more complicated nature of his personal claims would have had an adverse effect on the costly and time-consuming work required to prepare company W’s case for trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 After a comprehensive survey of the authorities, Lord Bingham noted (at 34) that it would have been “preferable” and indeed “efficient and economical” for the judge who tried the action by company W to also, at about the same time or shortly thereafter, rule on the plaintiff’s personal claim (as the judge would be familiar with the relevant details and evidence). Nevertheless, there were reasons implicitly accepted by both parties for not proceeding in that way. The Court of Appeal below had adopted too mechanical an approach in giving little or no weight to the considerations which led the plaintiff to act as he did, and failed to weigh the overall balance of justice. The appeal was allowed and the bringing of the personal action was held not to be an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The second relevant case is the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Aldi</span><span class="font-italic"> Stores</span>. In that case, the plaintiff first brought an action against Holmes Building Ltd (“Holmes”), the main contractor in the building of certain retail premises, for breach of warranty and negligence. Although the plaintiff was entitled to warranties from three other entities (the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Aldi Stores</span>), namely WSP Group plc, WSP London Ltd and Aspinwall &amp; Co Ltd (“the three defendants”), in the first action the plaintiff pursued its claims only against Holmes. Holmes, in turn, brought third party claims against the three defendants</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Subsequently, the plaintiff brought another action for damages for breach of warranty and negligence against the three defendants. The three defendants applied to strike out the claims on the basis of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata, </span>or the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>and <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Court of Appeal made the following important findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff had not behaved in any way that was culpable or improper. Instead, it had made a judgment that it would be in its interests to conduct proceedings in this way, as it was “sensible and cost effective”, in light of the length, costs and complexity of bringing claims against other parties (at [18], <span class="font-italic">per</span> Thomas LJ). Agreeing, Wall LJ stated (at [34]) that the course steered by the plaintiff through the complex litigation was (a) commercially reasonable; (b) forensically legitimate; and (c) reasonably transparent. He thus held that the plaintiff’s conduct in launching the second set of proceedings did not constitute an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The mere fact that the new action may require a trial and hence take up judicial time does not make the action impermissible. If an action can be properly brought, it is the duty of the state to provide the necessary resources; the litigant cannot be denied the right to bring a claim on the basis that he could have acted differently and so made more efficient use of the court’s resources (at [24], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Thomas LJ). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is a “real public interest in allowing parties a measure of freedom to choose whom they sue in a complex commercial matter and not to give encouragement to bringing a single set of proceedings against a wide range of defendants or to complicate proceedings by cross-claims against parties to the proceedings” (at [25], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Thomas LJ). Although it may be desirable that all possible actions arising from the same state of facts should be brought at the same time, this can be “a recipe for complex and unwieldy litigation” (at [39], <span class="font-italic">per</span> Longmore LJ).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In light of all the circumstances, Thomas LJ concluded (at [27]) that there were good reasons why the plaintiff acted as it did, and bringing the second action was not a misuse or abuse of the process of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The third decision I was referred to is another English Court of Appeal case, <span class="font-italic">Stuart v Goldberg Linde (a firm) and others</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 2 (“<span class="font-italic">Stuart</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Stuart</span>, the plaintiff successfully sued G and L, who were partners in a solicitor’s firm, for breach of an undertaking to pay him US$350,000 in connection with a proposed business venture in Mongolia. Later, the plaintiff issued further proceedings against G, L and a third defendant V, arising out of the same facts, in which he claimed damages, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for misrepresentation and inducing a breach of contract. The particulars of claim, which repeated many of the assertions in the earlier action, alleged that in reliance on L's misrepresentations, the plaintiff had concluded a contract with V, which V had been induced to breach as a result of derogatory and untrue statements made about the plaintiff by L. The plaintiff had known, before the trial of the earlier action, of the facts relevant to the inducement claim and had been aware of the falsity of some but not all of the statements on which the misrepresentation claim was based. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 G and L applied to strike out the second action as an abuse of the process of the court, on the basis that all the claims against them arising out of the same transaction should have been asserted in the earlier action. This was allowed at first instance.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff’s appeal. In particular, it held that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was not significant that the plaintiff, when preparing the particulars of claim in the second action, had copied large parts of the particulars of claim from the earlier action which set out the factual background to the matters at issue, as there was much common ground between the subject matter of the two actions (at [47]). It should, however, be noted that one relevant consideration weighing on the court’s mind was that the plaintiff was a litigant-in-person. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the statement of case of the earlier proceedings should simply have been amended to include the claim in inducement. Such an amendment would have transformed the whole proceedings, by introducing issues which were irrelevant to the claim for a breach of undertaking, and thereby expanding substantially the scope of the necessary evidence (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is no general principle that a potential plaintiff, who has not yet brought proceedings asserting a particular claim, is under a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to find out the facts relevant to whether he has or may have that claim (at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Requirement to give notice of other impending actions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Before drawing some principles for Singapore law, I make some final observations in relation to whether there is, or should be, a requirement to give notice to the other party of other potential impending actions. If the plaintiff is aware of the possibility that he may bring other claims related to the subject matter of the first action, is he required to inform the defendants or the Court of this during the proceedings for the first action? In <span class="font-italic">Johnson, </span>the defendant knew that the plaintiff was contemplating bringing further proceedings in his own name well before the trial of the action brought by company W. Lord Millett said (at 61) that it would have been “unconscionable” for the plaintiff to have stood by without disclosing his intentions and to have knowingly allowed company W to settle the action in the (mistaken) belief that the defendant was dealing finally with all liability arising from its alleged negligence. In <span class="font-italic">Aldi Stores</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [39]), Longmore LJ also refers to the fact that the plaintiff had made its position clear to the parties which it later sued in the second set of proceedings. This appeared to have weighed on his mind in concluding that the second action was not an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Sedley LJ in <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>(at [77]) held that “a claimant who keeps a second claim against the same defendant up his sleeve while prosecuting the first is at <span class="font-italic">high risk</span> of being held to have abused the court’s process” [emphasis added]. In this respect, “putting his cards on the table does not simply mean warning the defendant that another action is or may be in the pipeline. It means making it possible for the court to manage the issues so as to be fair to both sides”. Elaborating, Sir Anthony Clarke MR (as he then was) stated in <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>(at [96]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I do not think that parties should keep future claims secret merely because a second claim might involve other issues. <span class="font-italic">The proper course is for parties to put their cards on the table so that no one is taken by surprise and the appropriate course in case management terms can be considered by the judge.</span> In particular parties should not keep quiet in the hope of improving their position in respect of a claim arising out of similar facts or evidence in the future. Nor should they do so simply because a second claim may involve other complex issues. <span class="font-italic">On the contrary they should come clean so that the court can decide whether one or more trials is required and when</span>. The time for such a decision to be taken is before there is a trial of any of the issues. In this way the underlying approach of the [Civil Procedure Rules], namely that of co-operation between the parties, robust case management and disposing of cases, including particular issues, justly can be forwarded and not frustrated. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The necessity or desirability of notifying the court was also raised by Thomas LJ in <span class="font-italic">Aldi Stores </span>(at [30]-[31]). Thomas LJ was of the view that if parties had informed the Court of its wish to pursue other proceedings, the Court would at least be able to “express its view as to the proper use of its resources and on the efficient and economical conduct of the litigation”. He stated in no uncertain terms that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…if a similar issue arises in complex commercial multi-party litigation, it must be referred to the court seized of the proceedings. It is plainly not only in the interest of the parties, but also in the public interest and in the interest of the efficient use of court resources that this is done. There can be no excuse for failure to do so in the future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Wall and Longmore LJJ concurred on this point (see [36] and [42] of <span class="font-italic">Aldi Stores</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Thus, the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Res Judicata </span>at para 26.15(i) draws the following principles from case law in relation to this issue: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A claimant who elects to bring some claims against a defendant, and defer others until later should, as a general rule, <span class="font-italic">inform the defendant of his intention. </span>A claimant who does not <span class="font-italic">faces an increased risk that later proceedings will be abusive</span>, but only if he then knew the facts which entitled him to bring the later claim. A claimant should generally <span class="font-italic">inform the court</span> that he intends to bring other proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Nonetheless, I note the more nuanced view of Lloyd LJ in <span class="font-italic">Stuart</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [77])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that it is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a general proposition of law that it would necessarily be an abuse of process if the claimant does not inform the defendant of the fact that he is contemplating bringing such a claim in future, before the trial of the first set of proceedings. Instead, “different facts might lead to a different conclusion”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Some general principles for Singapore law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is a case management decision to litigate incrementally an abuse of the process of the court?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Although this specific question is novel, I agree with the AR that it essentially involves the same general approach of a “broad, merits-based test” (see the AR’s GD [57] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [48]), coupled with an “intense focus on the facts of the case” (see <span class="font-italic">Kotonou</span> ([78] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45]). As a matter of general principle, I am of the view that a reasonable and <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>case management decision by a plaintiff to bring his claims incrementally does not amount to an abuse of the process of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The fundamental reason for this is the public policy consideration of access to justice. A litigant ought not, as a general rule, to be deprived of his chance to litigate a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>claim, or of his autonomy in deciding when, how and against whom he wishes to bring his claim. As stated by Thomas LJ in <span class="font-italic">Aldi Stores </span>at [25], there is a “real public interest in allowing parties a measure of freedom to choose whom they sue in a complex commercial matter and not to give encouragement to bringing a single set of proceedings against a wide range of defendants or to complicate proceedings by cross-claims against parties to the proceedings”. Nonetheless, this autonomy conferred upon a plaintiff is not without limitation. In particular, I highlight the following.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 First, as caveated at [100] above, the decision to bring the claims incrementally must be both <span class="font-italic">reasonable </span>and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. The failure to bring the later claims in an earlier set of proceedings should not be the result of negligence or inadvertence. It stands to reason that as a general rule, the decision should be deliberate, reasoned, and sensible (both from a commercial and practical perspective). The reasons should be sufficient to override the competing public interest consideration of economy of litigation, under which it would generally be preferable and more efficient for a litigant to bring all his claims at the same time (see Lord Bingham in <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at 34, summarised at [88] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Some plausible reasons could include, for example, the discovery of new evidence after the first set of proceedings have concluded, the urgency of the situation which militates against commencing a complicated set of proceedings, or the lack of funds to proceed with the other claims in the first instance. The list of reasons is not exhaustive. Whether a particular reason is sufficient in the circumstances is a factual inquiry for the Court to undertake. On the other hand, if the litigant had acted wholly unreasonably by litigating in a manner that unduly taxes the court’s limited resources, without any plausible countervailing benefit, this would weigh in favour of concluding that the incremental litigation is an abuse of process. This is especially if the claim is, on its face, without merit, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, and would have been capable of being struck out on other grounds under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court (for example, if the party bringing the claim merely wishes to harass the opposing party with successive litigation). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Second, the incremental litigation pursued must not undermine another aim of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, which is to avoid bringing the justice system into disrepute. The two sets of proceedings must not, therefore, require the duplicative determination of the same underlying issues of fact, as this would give rise to the possibility of inconsistent judgments between different courts examining the same matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As stated by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Smith v Linskills (a firm) and another </span>[1996] 1 WLR 763 at 773, it would be an affront to any coherent system of justice if there subsisted two final but inconsistent decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction. This must also be the position in Singapore. Indeed, the efficacy of the judicial system substantially depends on the finality that is accorded to judicial determinations, which should not easily be reopened.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I conclude on this section with a succinct and helpful summary outlined by the learned author of <span class="font-italic">Res Judicata </span>at para 26.21:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A claimant is <span class="font-italic">not required to pursue all available remedies against all possible defendants in one proceeding</span>. Provided he <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">acts</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reasonably</span> he may <span class="font-italic">choose between available alternative</span>s <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">subject to the res judicata doctrine, and the need to avoid inconsistent judgments</span>, so long as any <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">later proceedings are not without merit, frivolous or vexatious, in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the light of an earlier decision. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is there a requirement to give notice of further proceedings to the defendant or to the court?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I turn now to consider the issue of whether a plaintiff who intends to make a case management decision to prosecute his claims incrementally ought to give notice to the defendant or to the court. The AR considered this at [67]–[69] of his GD, and agreed with Lloyd LJ in <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>(see [99] above) that there is there is no general proposition of law that a failure to put the other party on notice will necessarily render the subsequent action an abuse of process. The AR’s view was that the court should consider this factor against other relevant factors in applying the broad, merits-based assessment established in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I agree with the AR and am similarly hesitant to adopt the general position that a plaintiff who keeps a second claim up his sleeve while prosecuting the first is at a “high risk” of being held to have abused the court’s process. I also agree with the AR that at the most, this would be one factor in the court’s consideration of whether the second action was an abuse of process. It should not (automatically) be treated as a “special factor” that holds particular or enhanced significance. As the AR astutely observed (at [68] of his GD), while the requirement of notice would have the effect of promoting efficiency and economy of litigation, this would be at the expense of the principle of party autonomy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In coming to this conclusion, I am cognisant that there is another well-established principle underlying case procedure, which is to prevent unfair surprise to the other party, or what is sometimes called “litigation by ambush”.  The latter is a broad term. It can refer to many different things. In some cases, it may describe a party’s conduct within particular proceedings, such as late disclosure of relevant documentary evidence during trial. In other cases, it may concern the apparent decision of a litigant to institute legal proceedings on an incremental and sequential basis.  The prevention of unfair surprise is the reason that there are procedural rules undergirding amendments of pleadings. In this regard, it is not uncommon for a plaintiff to amend his claim to include new causes of action against the defendant especially at early stages. But in some cases, it may be permissible to amend even at late stages of the proceedings. Much may depend on the timing and substance of, and reasons for, the amendment. An application shortly before trial to add new causes of action which would alter the character of the case between the parties is rather different from an amendment to add a subsidiary cause of action between the same parties and based on the same facts, especially if this is done early and before the close of pleadings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the present context, it stands to reason that whether a decision to litigate incrementally should be disallowed on the ground of an abuse of process may well depend on whether the plaintiff was in a position, at the relevant time, to make a reasonably informed decision on whether it had other causes of action available to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In some cases, the plaintiff may be fully aware of his causes of action at the material time.  In other cases, he may only have a suspicion that other causes of action may come to light. In the latter situation, the decision not to inform the defendant that some other actions may be brought is understandable. To require the disclosure of a subsequent action in such circumstances would inevitably mean that the plaintiff is required, at a very early stage in the first set of proceedings, to investigate all the facts and be reasonably certain that they are capable of forming the basis of the subsequent action. This would be contrary to the holding in <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>(at [59]) that there is no general principle that a plaintiff who has not yet brought proceedings asserting a particular claim is under a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to find out the facts relevant to whether he has or may have such a claim (see [94(c)] above). In some cases, merely informing the defendant that some “other action” may be brought in the future may even be viewed as a form of “badgering.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In short, litigation often involves making strategic decisions on a broad range of issues such as the causes of action to be brought, the parties to include, and the forum to commence the action in. The timing of the suit could also be important in some cases. Doubtless there will be many other factors to be considered as well. In the context of the present question (whether there needs to be disclosure of intent to bring further proceedings), there is a need to balance the interests of the plaintiff, the defendant and the public. The mere fact that the plaintiff did not reveal his intention to bring further proceedings does not mean the further proceedings are necessarily abusive. The overall circumstances must be considered, including (but not limited to) factors such as: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the plaintiff is, at the time of the first set of proceedings, already able to make a reasonable decision as to whether a further cause of action is available (see [110]-[111] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) How closely connected the further causes of action are to the original proceedings in terms of the required supporting facts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the further cause of action is against the same defendant, either on his own or together with other parties. Sedley LJ’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>(see [96] above) on the importance of disclosure appear to have been directed at a second claim “against the <span class="font-italic">same defendant</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the parties are in negotiation over a possible settlement and, if so, whether this was intended to be an omnibus settlement of all present and potential future suits. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>, it may have been particularly important for the defendant to be informed of another impending action by the plaintiff because otherwise, non-disclosure could mislead the defendant into agreeing to settle the first action on the erroneous basis that it would be relieved of all liability whatsoever. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Should the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant be struck out on the facts?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Bearing in mind the legal principles outlined above, I now turn to consider whether, on the facts of the present case, the Plaintiffs’ decision to bring the present suit against the current Defendants after suing only McTrans in the 2009 Suit amounts to an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I begin by noting that the 1st Defendant has set out in Annex A to its submissions a detailed comparison of the Statement of Claim in the present suit, and the facts raised in the Plaintiffs’ pleadings, affidavits and cross-examination in the 2009 Suit.

</div>
</div> While the comparisons highlight the overlap in facts between the pleadings and other documents in both suits, I stress that a point-for-point comparison of the documents in the two sets of proceedings is not appropriate in this context. Instead, as earlier alluded to, a “broad, merits-based approach” should be adopted in such cases to examine whether the bringing of the later action is nothing more than an abuse of process of the Court. As was stated in <span class="font-italic">Stuart</span> at [47], any overlap between the two actions needs to be assessed by reference to the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the respective claims, not by a literal comparison of the two statements of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Upon consideration, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant in the present suit amount to an abuse of process. This is for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The risk of inconsistent judgments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 One significant reason I have considered is the similarity of the key issues that arise for determination both in the 2009 Suit and the present suit. In this regard, two foreign cases cited by the 1st Defendant in similar contexts are instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The first is the English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Michaels</span>. In that case, the plaintiff initially brought an action against four defendants who allegedly entered into a scheme to transfer the freehold of a block of flats to a certain company, without complying with the landlord’s requirement to give notice to a qualifying tenant under s 5 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (c 31) (UK) (“the Act”). The plaintiffs (who were qualifying tenants) argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the scheme was defective and that a s 5 notice should have been served. However, the Court of Appeal nonetheless declined to exercise its discretion to grant relief to the plaintiffs because of their delay in bringing the action. The plaintiffs then commenced a second set of proceedings in which they sought damages from three of the four defendants for a conspiracy to injure them by unlawful means. The defendants applied to strike out the claim. Laddie J duly struck out the claim, reasoning (at [73]) that the second action would attack the fundamental issue of whether the scheme was a breach of s 5 of the Act, which the Court of Appeal had already decided in the first action. If the plaintiffs’ claim were allowed to continue, this issue would either be re-litigated, with the possibility of inconsistent decisions, or the defendants would be bound by the outcome of the previous proceedings, with the result that they would  be deprived of an effective opportunity to show that nothing they did was wrongful. If the claims were re-litigated, the second court would need to “consider again all the documents, listen to all the witnesses and hear all the arguments which it heard before”. There was a possibility that the second court might “assess those documents, witnesses and arguments differently [from] the way they were assessed before”. This would result in a major duplication of costs and effort. For these reasons, Laddie J was of the view (at [77]) that the second set of proceedings constituted an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The next relevant case is the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <span class="font-italic">Paul </span><span class="font-italic">Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd &amp; ors </span>(2001) 53 NSWLR 198 (“<span class="font-italic">Rippon</span>”). In that case, the purchasers contracted to acquire a business under contracts which contained warranties of the reliability and accuracy of certain financial statements. Dissatisfied with their purchase, the purchasers brought proceedings against the vendor in the Supreme Court, pleading breach of warranty and fraudulent misrepresentation. Damages for a breach of warranty were awarded to the purchasers. However, the judge dismissed the claim based on misrepresentation, holding that the purchasers did not rely on any representations made. The purchasers then commenced a second set of proceedings in the District Court against the <span class="font-italic">vendor’s</span> <span class="font-italic">accountants</span> who prepared the financial statements, claiming damages for negligent misrepresentations which they had relied on in entering into the contracts. These alleged misrepresentations were in substance the same as those made in the first set of proceedings. The accountants applied to strike out the second set of proceedings on the basis that the purchasers were seeking to re-litigate the issue of reliance which they had lost in the Supreme Court. The claims were ultimately struck out. The Supreme Court of New South Wales reasoned that the second set of proceedings were “[i]n substance, ignoring the camouflage”, an attempt to “re-litigate issues which were either decided in or barred by the earlier proceedings” (at [28]), <span class="font-italic">vi</span><span class="font-italic">z</span>, whether the purchasers relied on the figures provided by the accountant. It held (at [36]) that although there was no question of oppression and unfairness because the accountants were not parties to the earlier action, the new proceedings threatened the integrity of the administration of justice and raised the prospect of conflicting judgments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Like the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Michaels </span>and <span class="font-italic">Rippon</span>, the present case is also one in which the same ultimate issues are essentially being re-litigated, albeit between different parties. In relation to the Plaintiffs’ claims in <span class="font-italic">deceit</span> and <span class="font-italic">conspiracy to defraud </span>(see [46(a)] and [46(b)] above), the question of whether the 1st Defendant (and/or the other Defendants) unlawfully or dishonestly gained possession and control over the Cargo, and thereafter detained or withheld the delivery of the Cargo, turns on whether the possession and control of the Cargo was wrongful or unlawful in the first place. This, in turn, heavily depends on findings of fact in relation to the Plaintiffs’ arrangements of freight forwarding with their customers, the question of whether they were head bailees and had a superior possessory title to the Cargo entitling them to immediate possession, and an examination of the same sequence of events leading to the switch of the consignee in the Bills of Lading to determine if this switch was unauthorised. All these findings of fact were dealt with in Ang J’s decision and affirmed on appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In relation to the Plaintiffs’ claim in unjust enrichment based on the Transportation Expenses, this is grounded on a failure of basis of the payments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a failure to name the 1st Plaintiff as consignee or to return the Cargo to the Plaintiffs in Singapore). This similarly requires the determination of whether the Plaintiffs were entitled to the Cargo in the first place, which depends on the same findings of fact highlighted in the previous paragraph. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 On analogy with <span class="font-italic">Michaels</span> (see [117] above), allowing the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant to proceed could lead to two alternative scenarios. The first is that the 1st Defendant would be allowed free rein to try to establish his defence. However, as the 1st Defendant’s counsel submits, this would put the 1st Defendant “in the invidious position of having to establish the facts necessary for his Defence in circumstances where Ang J has made findings to the contrary and had made adverse observations about him and the Court of Appeal has affirmed Ang J’s decision”.

</div> In such a case, a second court will need to “consider again all the documents, listen to all the witnesses and hear all the arguments which it heard before”. There was a possibility that “[the] second court might assess those documents, witnesses and arguments differently [from] the way they were assessed before” (see <span class="font-italic">Michaels </span>at [75]), which would bring the system of justice into disrepute. This is especially given that, in coming to her decision in the 2009 Suit, Ang J did not have the opportunity to hear the testimony of various key witnesses such as the 1st, 6th and 7th Defendants: see Ang J’s decision at [15] and [16]. I should add that any possibility of producing inconsistent decisions would be particularly undesirable in this case, given that, in reliance on Ang J’s judgment (including the findings of fact which are issues in the present suit), the Plaintiffs successfully brought an application to have McTrans wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The alternative scenario is that, if the second court finds that the 1st Defendant is behind McTrans and was effectively running McTrans’ defence in the 2009 Suit, it could hold that the 1st Defendant is bound by Ang J’s decision as a privy for the purpose of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [76] above). This alternative would be equally undesirable, as the 1st Defendant would not have had the opportunity to put forth his arguments concerning the issues decided in the 2009 Suit in his absence.

Although the balance (around 16%) (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the Group B Cargo) remains in McTrans’ possession, as Counsel for the 1st Defendant submits, there was no need for the Plaintiffs to obtain a return of the Group B Cargo because the owners of the Group B Cargo had joined in the 2009 Suit to recover the Group B Cargo on 20 January 2010 (see [29] above).

</div> This is puzzling: if the Plaintiffs’ immediate priority was in fact the delivery up of the Cargo, this would have been operating on their minds. It would only be natural for them to amend their Statement of Claim to include a prayer for such relief <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> after they consented to have no order made on the injunction application, rather than to let more than a year elapse before doing so. Indeed, it bears repeating that the 2009 Suit was not even brought in detinue but conversion. As Ang J stated at [156] of her decision, the relief of delivery up is not strictly available in a claim for conversion; see also Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span>”) at para 11.067<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)">. </span>As matters stand, I am doubtful about the urgency and importance of the delivery up of the Cargo to the Plaintiffs.

The 1st Defendant could  already have been sued <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic">dependently</span> in deceit in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In any event, I am not convinced that the Plaintiffs could not have brought the claim of conspiracy at the point of the 2009 Suit.

The Plaintiffs’ own documents in the 2009 Suit also made many references to the close links between the 1st Defendant and the 6th, 7th and 8th Defendants, and even contained allegations on the purported conspiracy to defraud the Plaintiffs. For example, in Hari’s affidavit dated 9 November 2009 at para 22, he states that “I believe the facts speak for themselves. <span class="font-italic">[The 1st Defendant] and the Defendants have clearly intended to defraud the Plaintiffs and destroy the Plaintiffs’ business.</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> and would have changed the complexion of the case by transforming the claim in conversion into a more complex suit (see <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>at [55]). These are fair points, given that liability for conversion is strict and it is no defence for the defendant to assert that he honestly and reasonably believed the goods to be his own property: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>at para 11.003. However, as the learned authors go on to state, liability is strict only in the sense that there is no requirement for evidence of the defendant’s intention to interfere <span class="font-italic">specifically with the claimant’s interests</span>. The defendant’s state of mind is nonetheless relevant when deciding whether the act complained of amounted to an act of conversion in law: namely the act of denying the claimant of his superior possessory title to the goods: see <span class="font-italic">Law of Torts in Singapore </span>at para 11.004. Further, where bailments of the goods have taken place, care may be needed in determining who has the immediate right to possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The point I make is that an action for conversion is not necessarily simple and straightforward. Indeed, it appears that the 2009 Suit in conversion was far from being a simple action. The 2009 Suit was originally set down for a 15-day hearing but it in fact was extended to 20 days. Ang J commented at [2] of her decision that the proceedings had a “lengthy procedural history”. I note in passing that both the Plaintiffs and McTrans were criticised for the manner in which the 2009 Suit was conducted. In the case of McTrans, Ang J commented at [2] that a reasonable and commercially minded party in McTrans position would have been anxious to extricate itself from the legal proceedings as soon as possible. Instead, McTrans “entrenched itself” in the proceedings. As for the Plaintiffs, Ang J observed at [2] that by the same token, there were opportunities whereby the Plaintiffs could have adopted a more robust attitude to rein in matters so that a full-blown trial for a case of this nature could be averted. While these observations by Ang J do not mean that the action for conversion was complicated (there may be several reasons why the Plaintiffs did not choose to adopt a more robust attitude), the point remains that the case appears to have been heavily contested on a complex weave of facts involving numerous individuals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It is readily apparent that the claim in conversion raised by the Plaintiffs in the 2009 Suit stood on the back of allegations in respect of the conduct of the 1st Defendant and assertions of his involvement in the conversion and fraud.  Given the manner in which the Plaintiffs chose to conduct the 2009 Suit, it is far from obvious that adding in claims against the 1st Defendant would have dramatically changed the complexion of the case (in terms of the evidence) and rendered the proceedings much more complex. Indeed, the present suit with causes of action in conspiracy, fraud and unjust enrichment flow from the same complex weave of facts and evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In cases where the causes of action are relatively simple and straightforward, the passage of time is unlikely to place the defendant in the second suit in a more difficult position. In other cases, such as the present suit, the underlying facts are highly contentious and complex. The events complained of took place some seven years ago. With the passage of time, it may well be harder for the 1st Defendant to marshal the documents and witnesses to support its position given the nature of the claims being brought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I should also add that it appears that as early as 6 November 2009, long before the trial of the 2009 Suit, the Plaintiffs had known that there was a risk that they were unlikely to obtain satisfaction from McTrans for the damages they were seeking. This is because in an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>injunction application (Summons No 5358 of 2009), Hari had exhibited in his second supporting affidavit the audited accounts of McTrans, which stated that its total liabilities substantially exceeded its total assets (which meant that it was balance sheet insolvent) and that McTrans has made a net loss in the financial year ending in 2008.

</div> If that were the case, there was good commercial reason for the Plaintiffs bring in at least the 1st Defendant at that stage, if only to increase the chances that any money judgment would be satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In sum, it is true, as the Plaintiffs’ counsel stresses, that the court “should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the litigant”: <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>([77] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [53]. However, the margin that can be afforded to the litigant seeking to bring such a claim to court is not unlimited. In this case, the two caveats outlined at [102]-[104] above have not been met. First, the incremental litigation strategy undermines one of the aims of the extended doctrines of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, in that there is a risk of inconsistent judgments on the same set of facts, which would bring the justice system into disrepute. Second, the decision to sue incrementally is not reasonable. In particular, since the claims against the 1st Defendant in the present suit are based on facts which were within the Plaintiffs’ knowledge at the time of the 2009 Suit, there is no reason the Plaintiffs could or should not have sued the 1st Defendant and added in other causes of action at the time of the 2009 Suit. It is far from clear that these would have dramatically changed the complexion of the 2009 Suit. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the present suit against the 1st Defendant is abusive and is to be struck out as an abuse of process pursuant to the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In reaching my decision, I considered two other factors but they <span class="font-italic">did not </span>affect my decision. First, I have noted the substantial delay between the commencement of the 2009 Suit and the present suit. As explained earlier, the Plaintiffs commenced the 2009 Suit against McTrans on 13 October 2009. The decision of Ang J was released on 30 July 2012. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 5 February 2013. The Plaintiffs do not appear to have made any attempt to claim or enforce the indemnity granted to them against McTrans.

</div>  Instead, on 8 October 2014, the Plaintiffs (together with the other plaintiffs in the 2009 Suit) served a statutory demand on McTrans for S$908,488.97 (comprising, not the indemnity, but the taxed legal costs and interest thereon). When they did not receive payment, they applied to wind up McTrans on the basis that it was unable to pay its debt. McTrans was wound up on 26 November 2014. It was only on 16 September 2015, that is, <span class="font-italic">after </span>McTrans was wound up, that the present suit was commenced by the Plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 However, the fact that substantial time has elapsed between the two suits (about two and a half years from the dismissal of the appeal to the commencement of the present suit) does not <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> mean that the present suit is necessarily abusive.

</div> I accept that an action cannot be abusive on this ground alone. As I have earlier stated, the Court must stand back and look at all the circumstances including the nature of the cause(s) of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Secondly, I have also noted that in the present case, it is evident that the Plaintiffs never gave McTrans and the 1st Defendant notice that proceedings would be taken out against the 1st Defendant. This was so even though it was clear that the Plaintiffs knew all along that their position was that the 1st Defendant was heavily involved in the conversion and fraud. The same is true of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants. However, as I have earlier stated, the mere fact that the Plaintiffs did not reveal their intention to bring further proceedings does not mean the further proceedings are necessarily abusive, especially when McTrans was not even a defendant in the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Should the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants be struck out on the facts?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 To recapitulate, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants are persons related to McTrans.

</div>
</div> Nothing prevented the Plaintiffs from naming the 3rd Defendant as a party to the 2009 Suit from the onset, or amending their Statement of Claim to include claims against the 3rd Defendant after the commencement of the 2009 Suit. The Plaintiffs must have known that he was involved in the unlawful possession and/or detention of the Cargo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In relation to the 4th and 5th Defendants, it must have been a publicly known fact that they were the directors and shareholders of McTrans. Any allegation against McTrans was therefore essentially an assertion that the directors and shareholders of the company are part of that conspiracy, as the controlling minds behind the company. There is no new evidence that the Plaintiffs did not already possess at the time of the 2009 Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Although the main allegations in the 2009 Suit were against the 1st, 6th, 7th and 8th Defendants, it is clear that the Plaintiffs were aware of the roles of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants in respect of the same series of events, and could and should have brought the claims against them at the time of the 2009 Suit. The claims against the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants were “so relevant to the subject matter of the first action that it was unreasonable for the [plaintiffs] not to rely upon them in that action” (<span class="font-italic">Rippon </span>at [23]). The Statement of Claim in the 2009 Suit should simply have been amended to include the claims against them. Given that the acts of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants that the Plaintiffs would have had to rely on are relatively contained, such amendments would not have transformed the whole proceedings, or have introduced significant new issues or widened the scope of the necessary evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Stuart </span>at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Further, for largely the same reasons analysed in relation to the 1st Defendant, if these Defendants are allowed to defend the present suit, they would have to challenge the fundamental unlawfulness of the detention of the Cargo, and many of the crucial findings in Ang J’s decision. This would again lead to the risk of inconsistent decisions by the second court examining the matter. Alternatively, the 4th and 5th Defendants may be found to be bound by Ang J’s decision as privies because they were essentially directors of McTrans (see [76] above). This would be in spite of the fact that the 4th and 5th Defendants apparently did not testify in the 2009 Suit and had no opportunity to put forth their version of events. Looking at the matter in the round this would be unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For these reasons, I am of the view that the claims against the 3rd, 4th and 5th Defendants should also be struck out as an abuse of process. Given my finding, there is no need to go on to consider the Defendants’ alternative arguments for striking out <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the claims are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Should the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 2nd Defendant be struck out on the basis of insufficient particulars in the amended F&amp;BPs? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Plaintiffs’ claims against the 2nd Defendant in the present suit, as outlined in the amended F&amp;BPs, are essentially limited to (a) the 2nd Defendant paying part of McTrans’ legal fees (about S$15,000) in the 2009 Suit and (b) the acts of Eugen, allegedly an authorised representative and/or agent of the 2nd Defendant. Eugen apparently contacted one Ms Serene Ng of Flowserve Pte Ltd, one of the suppliers of the Plaintiffs’ customers, and demanded payment of an unspecified sum of money and an issuance of release cargo letters to the 2nd Defendant, in return for the release of their goods.

</div> As explained earlier, the 2nd Defendant’s case is based largely on the alleged lack of particulars in the Plaintiffs’ pleadings in relation to its claim of conspiracy.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The absence of, or defects in, the particulars of pleadings can be a basis for striking out when the error is major, and the error cannot be made good by an amendment providing those particulars: Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2014 </span>(LexisNexis Singapore, 2014) at para 18/19/11. The relevant question is whether the defendants would know what the case they are supposed to meet is. This requires the pleadings to set out the details on how each element of the claim is met: <span class="font-italic">Kim Hok Yung and others v Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank) (Lee Mon Sun, third party) </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [6]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Unlawful means conspiracy occurs when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, the act is carried out and the intention achieved: <span class="font-italic">The “Dolphina”</span> [2012] 1 SLR 992 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">‘Dolphina’</span>”) at [202] (citing <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee v Ong and Co Pte Ltd</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 at [45]). The defendants must also have knowledge that they are part of an agreement, combination or common design: <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">‘Dolphina’ </span>at [204]. Further, although a company, being a legal person, can be a party to a conspiracy, it is an artificial construct. In order for it to be fixed with the requisite intention or state of mind, it is necessary to pinpoint some human actor with that state of mind and to determine whether, as a matter of law, that state of mind may be attributed to the company: <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">‘Dolphina’</span> at [205].    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 To support the claim that the 2nd Defendant (a company) had knowledge of the alleged conspiracy to defraud, the Plaintiffs rely on an attribution of knowledge based on the principle in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">‘Dolphina</span>’ above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The 2nd Defendant takes issue with the pleading of these particulars. On one hand, para 2.1(a) of the amended F&amp;BPs states that the <span class="font-italic">1st Defendant is the a</span><span class="font-italic">gent of the 2nd Defendant</span> and/or is to be identified with the 2nd Defendant such that the knowledge of the 1st Defendant can be attributed to the 2nd Defendant. This is because the 1st Defendant was a director and shareholder of the 2nd Defendant holding about 70% beneficial interest in the latter. On the other hand, para 2.2(d) of the amended F&amp;BPs states that the acts done by the 2nd Defendant were carried out “at or under the instructions of the 1st Defendant”. The 2nd Defendant argues that this suggests the converse of what the Plaintiffs earlier alleged, namely, that the <span class="font-italic">2nd Defendant is the agent of the 1st Defendant</span>. Thus, the 2nd Defendant’s counsel submits that the two paragraphs are “fundamentally contradictory” and would “affect how [the 2nd Defendant] defends its case in terms of imputation of knowledge.”

</div>
</div> However, I agree with the Plaintiffs’ counsel that para 2.2(d) does not state that the 2nd Defendant is an agent of the 1st Defendant, and that this is only what the 2nd Defendant “shorthands” the pleading to mean.

</div>
</div> Instead, a careful reading of the amended F&amp;BPs reveals that para 2.1(a) is a response to the request for “facts supporting the Plaintiffs’ allegation that the 2nd Defendant <span class="font-italic">knew of the alleged </span><span class="font-italic">scheme</span>” [emphasis added]. The Plaintiffs’ position in this respect is clear: they rely on the attribution of the 1st Defendant’s knowledge to the 2nd Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 On the other hand, para 2.2(d) is in response to a <span class="font-italic">different</span> request for particulars on “the <span class="font-italic">overt acts</span> carried out by the 2nd Defendant pursuant to or in furtherance of the alleged scheme” [emphasis added]. Para 2.2(a)-(b) therefore details the <span class="font-italic">overt</span><span class="font-italic"> acts</span> done by the 2nd Defendant (outlined at [144] above). Para 2.2(d) then states that there was no proper or legitimate commercial basis for the overt acts done by the 2nd Defendant, upon which the inference can be drawn that it was involved in the conspiracy. The two paragraphs therefore focus on and answer two completely different parts of the request for particulars, and cannot be said to be inconsistent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 For completeness, I deal with the 2nd Defendant’s argument that there was no basis for the Plaintiffs’ allegation that Eugen’s acts were done in the course of employment with the 2nd Defendant, rather than in his own capacity. This is because the relevant emails were sent to his personal email address, eugenchua@yahoo.com, rather than a company email address. Eugen was also referred to as “[the 1st Defendant’s] people”, and not as the staff of the 2nd Defendant.

</div> However, in my view, these arguments go towards the merits of the case and require evidence to be led (for example, on whether Eugen used his personal email address for business matters). It is not appropriate to go into the substance of the case in an application for striking out, especially at such a nascent stage of the proceedings. As I have earlier stated, the power of the court to strike out should only be done in a plain and obvious case; there cannot be a trial in chambers involving an assessment of the merits of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 For the abovementioned reasons, the 2nd Defendant’s appeal is dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In conclusion, the appeals by the 1st, 3rd, and 4th and 5th Defendants are allowed and the Plaintiffs’ claims against these Defendants are struck out in their entirety.
