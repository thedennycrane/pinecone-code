The Husband had previously been ordered to give an account of the trust property to the Wife in HC/OS 1407/2017 (“OS 1407/2017”), by way of the court order, HC/ORC 50/2019 (“ORC 50/2019”) dated 21 November 2018. Specifically, a list of documents (“P1”) was annexed to ORC 50/2019 detailing the categories of documents that the Husband was obliged to furnish. This obligation was made more specific in relation to the period of time for which the account had to be given in HC/OS 1339/2019 (“OS 1339/2019”), as extracted in HC/ORC 2356/2020 (“the Order”) dated 9 March 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The present originating summons, HC/OS 365/2020 (“OS 365/2020”), was an application by three companies (“the Companies”) for the Order to be varied to provide that nothing in the Order and ORC 50/2019 should be taken as compelling the production or disclosure of the categories of documents at S/Ns 5, 7, and 8 in P1 (“the Corporate Documents”) by any of the three companies to either the Husband or the Wife. The three categories of documents are laid out at [12] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having heard the parties, I dismissed the Companies’ application.

I summarise the main points briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The underlying dispute arose from the last will and testament (“the Will”) of the late Harkishindas Ghumanmal Bhojwani (“the Testator”). The Husband is one of the Testator’s three sons: <span class="font-italic">Jethanand </span>at [4].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The three Companies are all incorporated in Singapore. They are Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd (“SE”), Malaya Silk Store Pte Ltd (“MSS”), and Liberty Merchandising Company Pte Ltd (“LMC”). The Husband is a director of all three Companies. Various family members related to the Testator and the Husband are involved in the management of the Companies. The Companies’ involvement in the dispute between the Husband and the Wife arose from the fact that various shares in the Companies (“the Shares”) are part of the subject matter of a trust established by the Testator’s Will, for which the Husband is a trustee and the Wife (previously) one of the beneficiaries. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Will and the trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Testator’s Will established five discretionary trusts: <span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span> at [6]. The relevant trust in this case was established by cl 5 of the Will. The property in this trust (“the Clause 5 Trust”) was defined by cl 5.1(iv) of the Will to include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Shares in the Companies, as follows:

The application in OS 1339/2019 was concerned primarily with the effect of these deeds. In <span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span>, I held that the deeds executed on 10 January 2020 were sufficient to exclude the Wife’s interest as a beneficiary from that date onwards. This meant that her entitlement to an account from the Husband had ceased by 10 January 2020: <span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span> at [78]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 While the focus of OS 1339/2019 was on the effect of those deeds, the Husband had also raised the issue of the scope of the documents to be disclosed, citing issues relating to the Companies. He argued that the scope of the documents should be varied to account for those issues. In that case, I held that issue estoppel prevented the Husband from revisiting the scope of the documents on the basis of the alleged objections by the Companies: <span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span> ([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [39]. In any event, I would not have granted the variation sought by the Husband, since the Companies were not before me in OS 1339/2019 (<span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span> at [84]) and, as between the Husband and the Wife, the Husband’s difficulty, if any, in obtaining the documents did not warrant a variation of the Wife’s <span class="font-italic">entitlement</span> to the account: <span class="font-italic">Jethanand</span> at [86].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In substance, the Order modified ORC 50/2019 such that the Husband’s obligation to account was given an endpoint, and reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

While I acknowledge that there were a number of peripheral issues surrounding the present application, these were ultimately not before me for determination. For reasons that I will elaborate on below, I considered it appropriate to determine OS 365/2020 on the narrow grounds relating to the specific prayer for variation sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I begin with what this case was not. This was not an application by the Wife or the Husband for the Companies to disclose and produce the Corporate Documents. Correspondingly, it was not an application by the Companies for a declaration that they could resist any application by the Wife or the Husband for the Corporate Documents. Neither was it an application by the Companies to restrain the Husband from disclosing whatever subset of the Corporate Documents that was already in his possession. It was also not an action by the Wife against the Companies for interfering with the Husband’s administration of the Clause 5 Trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As formulated, the prayer in OS 365/2020 was concerned with one thing only: clarifying that <span class="font-italic">the Order and ORC 50/2019</span> did not have the effect of <span class="font-italic">compelling</span> the Companies to produce or disclose any of the Corporate Documents to the Husband and the Wife. The central question is therefore whether the terms of the Order and ORC 50/2019 compelled or could be interpreted as compelling the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents, such that the variation of the Order would be justified. Hence, the scope of the application was limited to the Order and ORC 50/2019 as the <span class="font-italic">source</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> of the obligation, and limited to the question of whether the Companies were in truth <span class="font-italic">under an obligation</span> from those sources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It is only if this question were answered in the affirmative that the issue of whether there was any rule of law or any disability in the Companies’ powers that prevented the Companies from disclosing the Corporate Documents would arise in the first place. The various arguments relating to the articles of association and the Companies Act would only be relevant if the prior orders imposed such an obligation or if the orders of court could be construed as imposing that obligation. If the prior orders <span class="font-italic">did</span> compel production and disclosure, then these arguments would go towards urging the court to modify the obligation (assuming, for the sake of argument, that it would be possible to do so). If the prior orders could be <span class="font-italic">interpreted</span> as compelling production and disclosure (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if there is an ambiguity), then the argument would be that the court should adopt an interpretation of the prior orders that would be most consistent with these other rules. But, at the risk of repetition, these only arise if the central question – whether the Order and ORC 50/2019 compelled or could be interpreted as compelling the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents – had been answered in the affirmative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 While it was possible for the court to go further into the issue of whether the Companies could resist any application for production and disclosure by the Husband and the Wife, or whether, more generally, the Companies could justifiably refuse production and disclosure of the Corporate Documents, I did not consider it appropriate to do so in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, this being the Companies’ application, I preferred to allow the Companies to set the scope of their application, rather than to deal with issues that were not directly raised by the application and unnecessary for its disposal. Any determination I made must be focused on the relief sought by the Companies, rather than try to resolve all the issues as between the Husband, Wife, and Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, any such determination would be purely hypothetical, because, on the evidence before me, there has not been any request by the Husband or Wife for production and disclosure ever since the earlier request in which the Companies took the position that ORC 50/2019 did not compel the Husband to seek the Corporate Documents that were not already in his possession.

</div> It has since been clarified – and the Husband and Wife are also agreed – that the obligation in the Order and ORC 50/2019 extends to all documents in the Husband’s possession, control, and power. No further request for documents has apparently been made since that clarification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, relatedly, if the question of whether the Companies could resist a request for production and disclosure were to be determined <span class="font-italic">in vacuo</span>, the determination would be made without the benefit of having all the facts before the court. Specifically, in the absence of a particular request by the Husband and/or Wife accompanied by a list of documents, the following facts remained uncertain: (a) which documents did the Husband already have in his possession and would thus not need to be <span class="font-italic">requested</span> from the Companies; (b) which documents still remained to be produced and disclosed; and (c) which categories of documents fell into which rules of disclosure and production. The first question of fact affects the legal analysis as the dispute over those documents would raise different principles relating to the Husband’s <span class="font-italic">use</span> of documents previously given by the Companies. That would involve the question of whether the Companies were entitled to restrain a shareholder from using documents already in his possession for the purpose of accounting for trust property. The latter two questions would be relevant as to whether the existing rules on disclosure of documents, for example, s 203(3) of the Companies Act, would cover the documents. Given the absence of facts, this was not an appropriate case for determining, in the abstract, whether the Companies could resist any application for the documents by the Husband and/or the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Fourth, these issues were of general importance, far beyond the scope of the present dispute. The position taken by the Companies would, as Mr Damodara accepted on the face of the proposition, also affect all of their other shareholders who may be trustees, including the Husband’s two brothers who are also trustees for different trusts under the Will.

</div>
</div> More generally, it would also have an impact on many companies whose shares are the subject matter of trusts. I considered it prudent not to make determinations that would affect a significant range of companies and individuals on an application that was directed at a narrower matter. This was especially given that the resolution of these issues was not necessary for my decision in OS 365/2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Hence, given the central question in this case, I focused my decision on whether the Order and ORC 50/2019 did actually compel production and disclosure of the Corporate Documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Apart from the central question in this case, there was also the issue of whether the relief sought by the Companies could be justified. Even if the Companies are not obliged by the Order and ORC 50/2019 to produce and compel the Corporate Documents, that did not necessarily mean that the Order should be varied as the Companies prayed for. I considered this as a second stage in the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Hence, bearing in mind the scope of the application and the parties’ submissions, I identified the following two issues for my determination:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the prior orders of court compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents?  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If (a) is answered in the affirmative, should the obligation be discharged or otherwise varied? Alternatively, if (a) is answered in the negative, should the court vary the Order according to the Companies’ application?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In summary, I found that the prior orders of court did not compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents. However, I also decided that the court ought not to vary the Order according to the Companies’ application.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did any of the prior orders of court compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 At the outset, I acknowledge that the mere fact that a person was not a party to the proceedings in which a judgment or order was made does not necessarily mean that the judgment or order cannot be enforced against that person. Order 45 r 9(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any person, not being a party to a cause or matter, against whom obedience to any judgment or order may be enforced, shall be liable to the same process for enforcing obedience to the judgment or order as if he were a party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This assumes that certain non-parties may be placed under obligations by court orders. Ultimately, the question of whether the non-party can be bound by the order of court depends on the construction of the order: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">White Book</span>”) at para 45/9/1, citing <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Teo Hee Lai Building Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 52.<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic"> </span>In this case, I found that it was unambiguous that the Order and ORC 50/2019 did not compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents. This is apparent from the terms of the orders themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Nothing in the Order and ORC 50/2019 suggested that any obligation was imposed on the Companies. ORC 50/2019 stated that the <span class="font-italic">Husband</span> was to provide the documents in P1 as part of his duty to give an account of the trust property. The Order only modified the obligation as to the period of time for which the account had to be given. In other words, the only obligations created by the court orders were imposed on the Husband in his role as a trustee. The mere fact that the Companies would be <span class="font-italic">involved</span> in the Husband’s pursuit of complying with his obligations does not mean that the Companies were correspondingly <span class="font-italic">obliged</span> by the Order and ORC 50/2019. This is so even though the Husband’s obligation extends to all documents in his possession, power, and control, since that obligation belongs to the Husband, and not to any other party. Nothing in the terms of those orders imposed a duty on the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42   Put another way, the Husband, as a trustee, had obligations that were personal to him. The prior orders of court merely set out the Husband’s obligations to the Wife as trustee. He had to comply with those obligations, and in doing so, had to deal with the Companies in seeking the Corporate Documents. Whatever rights or obligations the Companies had <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Husband in relation to the production and disclosure of documents is not governed by the Order and ORC 50/2019, but by whatever rules governed the relationship between the Companies and the Husband, whether it be the articles of association, the Companies Act or some other source. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 There may, conceivably, be a situation where the Companies act in such a way that gives the Wife a claim against the Companies for interfering with the administration of the Clause 5 Trust, or for aiding the Husband to breach his obligations as a trustee. These issues are not before the court in the present proceedings. In any event, it would appear that the rights of the Wife against the Companies would not be founded upon the Order or ORC 50/2019, but more generally on the law of trusts. Nothing in those prior proceedings have determined the Wife’s and/or Husband’s rights against the Companies, because these were simply not in issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Should the court vary the Order?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having found that the Order and ORC 50/2019 did not compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents, the next question was whether the Order should be varied as prayed for by the Companies. I found that such a variation was not appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my judgment, the Companies did not have standing to pursue variation of the Order. In the first place, the Companies had withdrawn their application to intervene in OS 1407/2017 and had never filed an application to do so in OS 1339/2019. Hence, they were never formally given leave to intervene in the prior proceedings. Having omitted to obtain leave to intervene previously, it should not be possible for the Companies to bypass that requirement simply by bringing a separate action in OS 365/2020 to vary a previous court order. The court would have to scrutinise the Companies’ standing to bring the application. The Companies had to show in the present proceedings why they should be allowed to interfere in a court order that determined the rights and obligations between the Husband and the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">VisionHealthOne Corp Pte Ltd v HD Holdings Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others (Chan Wai Chuen and another, third parties)</span> [2010] 3 SLR 97 (“<span class="font-italic">VisionHealthOne</span>”) dealt with a similar situation where the plaintiff had applied for discovery against a non-party, the Bank of China Limited (“BOC”). The assistant registrar allowed the application. The documents ordered to be disclosed included documents pertaining to the second defendant’s account with BOC. The second defendant appealed against the discovery order and the plaintiff sought to have the appeal struck out. The High Court held that the second defendant lacked the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to challenge the discovery order on appeal: <span class="font-italic">VisionHealthOne</span> at [20]. The High Court’s reasoning is instructive (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the case of <span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings Ltd</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1017, Yong Pung How CJ held that the applicants who were prohibited by way of implied undertaking from using all documents and copies obtained pursuant to a search warrant and information extracted therein had <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to make an application to the High Court for the restriction to be lifted. Yong CJ held (at [18]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the applicants were parties directly affected by the restriction, they had a direct personal interest in seeking relief to vary the order of court and/or to be released from the implied undertaking. It followed they must have the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to make an application for the restriction to be lifted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hence, it can be deduced that in order to demonstrate <span class="font-italic">locus</span> <span class="font-italic">standi</span> to file an appeal against an order, one has to show that one is affected or aggrieved by the court order and therefore has a personal interest in seeking variation or release from the said order. Further and in addition to that, where it is in the nature of an appeal, I take the view that the appellant must generally be a party to the application below that gave rise to the orders that form the subject of his appeal before he has standing to appeal against those orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 While the High Court’s reasoning was targeted at appeals, the citation of <span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v SM Summit Holdings and another </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1017 (“<span class="font-italic">Microsoft</span>”) at [18] shows that the principles relating to <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> apply equally to applications to vary a prior court order. Such a party seeking a variation of a court order would have to show that it was “affected or aggrieved by the court order” (<span class="font-italic">VisionHealthOne</span> at [19]) and therefore had a “direct personal interest in seeking relief” (<span class="font-italic">Microsoft </span>at [18]). The Companies appeared to accept this principle, and argued simply that their interests were affected by the Order.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  CWS at para 36. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The difficulty with the Companies’ argument on standing is that the Order and ORC 50/2019 did not impose any obligation on them at all. The orders were purely concerned with the Husband’s obligations to the Wife. For the reasons I have expressed above, nothing in the orders affected the Companies. As such, there is no reason to suppose that they have been affected or aggrieved by the Order. Therefore, they did not have standing to seek a variation of the Order. The fact that they were also never parties to OS 1407/2017 or OS 1339/2019 further reinforced this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any event, I found that the circumstances did not justify an exercise of the court’s power to vary the Order. Although the Companies did not expressly identify the legal basis of the court’s power to do so, I surmised that they were relying on the court’s inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the ROC. As Mr Yeo rightly submitted, the court should only exercise these inherent powers in “exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands”: <span class="font-italic">White Book </span>at para 92/4/2. As the Court of Appeal put it in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27], the “essential touchstone is really that of ‘need’.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The fact of the matter is that, on the face of the Order and ORC 50/2019, the Companies were simply not placed under any obligation in relation to the Corporate Documents. This much is clear, and any variation proposed by the Companies would contribute nothing to the implementation of the Order. It would do no more than to state what is already apparent from the prior court order themselves. Further, given the scope of the variation sought, the variation would not serve to prevent future disputes from arising in relation to the Companies’ duty to provide the Corporate Documents, if that duty arises from other sources of law. Even if the variation were granted, the issues surrounding the Companies’ duties to the Husband <span class="font-italic">qua</span> shareholder, the Wife’s right to enforce her or the Husband’s entitlement (if any) to the documents, and the Companies’ duties not to interfere with the administration of the trust (if there are indeed such duties arising on the facts) would still remain to be determined. Finally, the Order and ORC 50/2019 are directed at setting out the rights and obligations as between the Husband and Wife, and the insertion of this caveat in the Order would simply distract from that purpose with no apparent benefit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, this was clearly not a situation where there was a <span class="font-italic">need</span> to vary the Order. Given my conclusions above, I do not go on to deal with the questions of whether the court was <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, whether the issue was barred by <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>or abuse of process, or the substantive issue of whether the Companies would be entitled to resist any request for documents or restrain the Husband from disclosing the documents already in his possession. I state, for the avoidance of doubt, that my decision in this case is without prejudice to any claims that the Wife and/or Husband may bring against the Companies for the Corporate Documents to be produced and disclosed on the basis of any other source of obligation other than the Order or ORC 50/2019, or any arguments that the Companies may have in resisting that production and disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 While the Companies’ position that the Order and ORC 50/2019 did not compel the Companies to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents was correct, this application was simply unnecessary and the relief sought was unjustified. There having been no application by the Husband or Wife for the documents yet, the issue was purely hypothetical. Matters may have been different if the Companies were raising this issue <span class="font-italic">to resist </span>any application for enforcement of the Order or ORC 50/2019 against them, or any request for documents from the Husband or the Wife. But, in any event, even if a request had been made, the prayer in OS 365/2020 simply served no real purpose since it was limited to the question of whether the Order and ORC 50/2019 <span class="font-italic">imposed</span> an obligation to produce and disclose the Corporate Documents, without touching on any other potential source of obligation. Unfortunately, this action only served to increase costs and incur delay for the parties to the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As I found that the Companies lacked the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring the application for variation, and the variation sought was simply unjustified and unnecessary, I concluded that the Wife had essentially succeeded in resisting the application. I therefore ordered that the Companies pay costs fixed at $8,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the Wife. I made no order as to costs for the Husband, as the Husband did not take a position on the substantive issue, and as counsel for the Husband did not press for a costs order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Therefore, I dismissed OS 365/2020.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suresh s/o Damodara, Ong Ziying Clement and Khoo Shufen Joni (Damodara Ong LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat, Kanapathi Pillai Nirumalan, Ow Jiang Meng Benjamin and Ho Jun Yang Joshua (He Junyang) (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin SC, Chang Man Phing Jenny, Gavin Neo Jia Cheng and Khoo Kiah Min Jolyn (WongPartnership LLP) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
