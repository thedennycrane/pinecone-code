By it, the accused person waives his right to be convicted only after a full trial. The prosecution need not adduce evidence to prove the accused person’s guilt. The accused is also precluded from appealing against his conviction even if he subsequently comes to regret the plea, so long as the plea is not set aside.

As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Koh </span><span class="font-italic">Bak Kiang </span>(at [42]), one safeguard is the strict duty imposed on the judge recording the plea to ensure that “the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him”. This duty is now found in s 227(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). Another is s 228(4) of the CPC, which states that where the court is “satisfied that any matter raised in the plea in mitigation materially affects any legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged, the court must reject the plea of guilty”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This issue in this application for criminal revision concerns the scope of s 228(4), specifically, whether it applies where an accused person retracts his plea of guilty and disputes all the elements of the offence, in his mitigation plea.

I therefore set aside the applicant’s conviction and sent the case back to the State Courts for trial.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The prosecution has filed Criminal Reference No 5 of 2018 to refer the following questions of law of public interest for the decision of the Court of Appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does s 228(4) of the CPC apply to a case where an accused person seeks to retract his plea of guilty at the mitigation stage of sentencing?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Must an accused person seeking to retract his plea of guilty at the mitigation stage of sentencing satisfy a court that he has valid and sufficient grounds for his retraction before the court can reject his plea of guilty?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The facts can be briefly stated. The applicant was charged with 63 offences under s 22A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed). Each charge alleged that the applicant had received directly from a foreign employee a sum of $2,000 as a condition for employment by one of two companies that the applicant represented. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The trial proceeded on all 63 charges on 26 April 2018. On the next day, the applicant pleaded guilty to 20 charges and admitted to the amended statement of facts without qualification. He also consented to the remaining 43 charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was convicted accordingly by the trial judge on that day. The applicant’s then counsel, Mr Kalidass, requested an adjournment for the mitigation plea and his submissions on sentence, and the case was adjourned to 23 May 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Subsequently, the applicant appointed Mr Peter Fernando to represent him in place of Mr Kalidass.

The mitigation plea reproduced the same grounds relied upon in the earlier application to retract the plea of guilty.

</div> The trial judge described the applicant’s mitigation plea as “a backdoor way to turn back the clock and resile from his plea of guilty” and “an abuse of process”. The trial judge then refused to reject the applicant’s plea of guilty and proceeded to sentence the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The scope of s 228(4) of the CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 It is well established that the Court’s power of criminal revision to set aside convictions may be exercised only sparingly and only if there is serious injustice or a miscarriage of justice: <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Leng Khim v PP and another matter</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1219 at [8]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Section 228(4) of the CPC states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) Where the court is satisfied that any matter raised in the plea in mitigation materially affects any legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged, the court must reject the plea of guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13  It seems to me that where the court below refused to reject a plea of guilty despite the fact that the mitigation plea materially affected one or more legal conditions required by law to constitute the offence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the mitigation plea qualified the plea of guilty), that would be a miscarriage of justice and the High Court ought to exercise its revisionary powers to set aside the conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Before me, the prosecution did not argue otherwise. However, the prosecution submitted that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) s 228(4) of the CPC does not apply where an accused person’s mitigation plea amounts to a retraction of his plea of guilty; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an accused person seeking to retract his plea of guilty at the mitigation stage must show valid and sufficient grounds for his retraction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The language in s 228(4) appears unambiguous. The controversy in this case arose because of a line of cases that have held that an accused person cannot retract his plea of guilty except on valid and sufficient grounds which satisfy the court that it is proper and in the interest of justice that he should be allowed to do so. It was based on this line of cases that the prosecution submitted that the applicant had to show valid and sufficient grounds to support the retraction of his plea of guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 A reading of the cases suggests, unsurprisingly, that valid and sufficient grounds exist if the plea of guilty is not valid. The cases recognise that under common law, for a plea of guilty to be valid, three safeguards must be observed. First, the court must ensure that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty (“the first safeguard”). Second, the court must ascertain whether the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea (“the second safeguard”). Third, the court must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him (“the third safeguard”). See <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Kannan v PP</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span>”) at [15]–[16]. <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>noted that the second and third safeguards were embodied in ss 180(a) and 180(b) of the 1985 Revised Edition of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC 1985”), which applied to summary trials by the Magistrate’s Court or District Court. See, also, <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Lam Seng v PP</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 346 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Lam Seng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5]–[6]. Sections 180(a) and 180(b) of the CPC 1985 are largely similar to what is now ss 227(1) and 227(2) of the CPC. The second and third safeguards referred to above therefore appear in both editions of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 <span class="font-italic">Ganesun </span>appears to have been accepted as authority for the proposition that retraction of a plea of guilty will not be permitted if the three safeguards have been observed. Presumably, the basis for this is that the plea of guilty would be valid if the three safeguards have been observed. <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span> also referred (at [22]) to there being “no question of a mistake or misunderstanding”. It seems to me that this was just a reference to the fact that the accused in that case understood the nature of the offence that he had pleaded guilty to and consequences of his plea, and that he understood the material facts that he had admitted to without qualification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The prosecution submitted that the applicant’s mitigation plea was tantamount to a retraction of his plea of guilty, and as such s 228(4) of the CPC was not applicable. The prosecution referred me to <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and submitted that the applicant’s retraction of his plea of guilty should not be permitted because the three safeguards referred to in <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span> have been observed and therefore his plea of guilty was valid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I disagreed with the prosecution’s submissions. First, the prosecution’s submissions drew a distinction between a mitigation plea that is tantamount to a retraction of a plea of guilty and one that is not. It seems to me that the distinction cannot be supported in principle. After all, a mitigation plea that qualifies a plea of guilty results in a qualified plea which is in fact a plea of not guilty: see <span class="font-italic">Koh </span><span class="font-italic">Bak Kiang</span> at [41]. When an accused person qualifies his plea, he is in fact saying he is not guilty. That must mean that he is also saying that he has changed his mind about his previous plea of guilty, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he is retracting his previous plea. It makes no difference whether, in qualifying his plea, the accused disputes one element of the offence or all of the elements of the offence, or whether he denies <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>or <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> or both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Second, nothing in the language of s 228(4) suggests, much less supports, the prosecution’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Third, if the mitigation plea disputes one or more (but not all) of the elements of the offence, s 228(4) mandates the court to reject the plea of guilty. The prosecution did not dispute this. Yet, the prosecution’s submissions mean that s 228(4) cannot apply if the mitigation plea disputes <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the elements of the offence (which is what the applicant did in the present case) because that would be tantamount to a retraction of his plea of guilty. This cannot be correct. The more elements of the offence that the accused disputes, surely the greater the need for the court to reject the plea of guilty under s 228(4). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Fourth, even if one accepted the prosecution’s distinction between a mitigation plea that is tantamount to a retraction and one that is not, the prosecution’s case seemed to assume that the observance of the three safeguards test would treat the two differently. I do not think this is correct. Section 228(4) of the CPC was enacted in 2010. It specifically deals with the situation where the mitigation plea qualifies the plea of guilty. It would appear that prior to 2010, a qualified plea of guilty was dealt with within the third safeguard: <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Lam Seng </span>at [6]–[7]<span class="font-italic">.</span> This can also be seen in <span class="font-italic">Balasubramanian</span><span class="font-italic"> Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 138 where the Court cited <span class="font-italic">Ulaganathan</span><span class="font-italic"> Thamilarasan v PP </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 112 and said (at [29]) that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The law in Singapore is that, if the mitigation plea qualified the earlier plea of guilt by indicating the lack of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> or <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span>, the accused would not be deemed to have admitted to the offence without qualification and the plea would be rejected by the court...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In other words, even before s 228(4) was enacted, a qualified plea would have meant that the third safeguard had not been observed and would have been sufficient to satisfy the “valid and sufficient grounds” requirement for retraction of a plea of guilty. It appears that s 228(4) codified the then-existing position applicable to retraction of a plea of guilty where the mitigation plea qualified the plea of guilty. This seems to have been recognised in <span class="font-italic">Md</span><span class="font-italic"> Rafiqul Islam Abdul Aziz v PP </span>[2017] 3 SLR 619 (“<span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [35]) although there, the Court put it in more general terms. In the circumstances, there is no reason why s 228(4) should not apply to cases involving a retraction of a plea of guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 There is one difference between the common law position and s 228(4). It appears that under common law principles, the court has the discretion to refuse to allow retraction of a plea of guilty even where the retraction is made as early as before the reading of the statement of facts: <span class="font-italic">Thong Sing Hock v PP</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 47 at [24]. Although the High Court in that case went on to opine that retraction of a plea of guilty before the reading of the statement of facts should generally be allowed as of course but once an accused admits to the statement of facts, permitting the retraction of the plea is discretionary and only for valid reasons, the fact remains that permitting the retraction is discretionary under common law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Section 228(4), on the other hand, makes it compulsory for the court to reject a qualified plea of guilty but (as also recognised in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]), it only applies where the accused has not been sentenced. Section 228(4) thus draws a distinction between a retraction of a plea of guilty <span class="font-italic">before</span> the case is concluded and one after the court has become <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio.</span> The fact that s 228(4) favours the accused who retracts his plea of guilty before his case concludes is understandable. As <span class="font-italic">Koh </span><span class="font-italic">Bak Kiang</span> pointed out, a plea of guilty carries with it grave implications (see [1] above). Section 228(4) provides a crucial safeguard by mandating the court to reject a plea of guilty if it is qualified by the accused during the mitigation plea.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, after the case is concluded, another principle comes into play – that of finality as reflected in s 375 of the CPC. Section 375 limits appeals where the accused has been convicted on a plea of guilty, to appeals only against the extent or legality of the sentence. It is not unjust that an accused person should be treated less favourably where he retracts his plea of guilty after the case is concluded. As the Court in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span> observed (at [45]), </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…Where an accused seeks to retract his plea of guilt by way of revision <span class="font-italic">only after</span> he has been sentenced and the court of first instance is <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it should follow that a higher threshold would have to be met before the court exercises its revisionary powers, bearing particularly in mind the principle of finality. An accused ought not to be allowed to mount a “back-door appeal” against a conviction and sentence just because he is unhappy with the sentence imposed. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Fifth, I find support for my decision in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span>, in which the Court considered and applied s 228(4) of the CPC. In that case, the applicant was charged for making a fraudulent claim for compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed). He pleaded guilty to, and was convicted on, the charge. The mitigation plea was adjourned to the next day, at which time, the applicant sought to retract his plea on the basis that if he were going to proceed with it, he may have to qualify his plea because he did not have the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>. The District Judge’s attention was drawn to s 228(4) but he rejected the applicant’s retraction of the guilty plea. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The High Court reviewed the cases and observed (at [30]) that “if and when a plea of guilt is in fact qualified in mitigation, the actual plea is that of ‘not guilty’ and the court ought not to convict the accused on the charge”. The Court also noted (at [31]) that with the enactment of s 228(4) in 2010, the previous approach to guilty pleas that have been qualified in the course of mitigation has been codified. The Court further noted (at [33]) that s 228(4) “reflects the law’s recognition that where an accused has qualified his plea during mitigation … the guilty plea ... cannot be regarded as an unequivocal one”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The High Court set aside the applicant’s conviction. In the Court’s judgment, s 228(4) applied “squarely to the facts” of the case (at [37]). The Court held (at [44]) that “the <span class="font-italic">retraction</span> should have been allowed by the [District Judge]” (emphasis added). <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>therefore is authority for the proposition that s 228(4) applies to a retraction of a plea of guilty at the stage of the mitigation plea. The Court in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>clearly did not draw any distinction between a mitigation plea that amounts to a retraction and one that does not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I would add one observation. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span> (at [40]–[41]), <span class="font-italic">Koh </span><span class="font-italic">Thian Huat v PP</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 113 and <span class="font-italic">Ganesun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>involved similar facts in that the accused had pleaded guilty and wished to retract the plea before sentencing. The Court in both cases did not allow the accused persons to retract their pleas because the relevant procedural safeguards had been complied with and each of the accused persons fully understood the nature and consequences of his plea. I respectfully agree with the view expressed in in <span class="font-italic">Rafiqul</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [41]) that these two cases can be distinguished on the ground that they were decided prior to the enactment of s 228(4). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For the reasons set out above, I concluded that for purposes of s 228(4) of the CPC, there is no distinction between a mitigation plea that is tantamount to a retraction of a plea of guilty and one that is not. A qualified plea is in fact a plea of not guilty and therefore a mitigation plea that qualifies a plea of guilty is a retraction of the earlier plea. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As the applicant’s mitigation plea did qualify his plea of guilty, the court below ought to have rejected his plea of guilty. Accordingly, I set aside his convictions in the court below and sent the case back to the State Courts for trial.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Peter Fernando (Leo Fernando) for the applicant;<br/>Mark Jayaratnam, Kelvin Kow and Senthilkumaran Sabapathy (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
