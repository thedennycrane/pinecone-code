</div>
</div> According to the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, he and Spencer “orally agreed” in the course of a discussion sometime in late 2013 that he (the Plaintiff) would purchase the BMW M6 from Munich Automobiles Pte Ltd (“Munich Automobiles”); and “[i]n particular”, the two of them shared a common intention that:

The purchase price was not paid in one lump sum. Spencer first paid a deposit of S$30,000.00 to Munich Automobiles by way of cheque on 19 February 2014. He then used his credit card to make payment of S$236,000.00 to Munich Automobiles on 26 February 2014. As for the outstanding balance which came up to S$300,000.00, Spencer took out a 5-year loan from BMW Financial Services Singapore Pte Ltd (“BMW Financial Services”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On his part, according to the Plaintiff, he paid Spencer S$266,000.00 in cash. This amount covered the deposit Spencer had paid for the car, as well as the partial payment he had made using his credit card. As for the vehicle loan from BMW Financial Services, the Plaintiff paid the loan instalments which amounted to S$5,570.00 per month for a period of 60 months. The Plaintiff made these monthly repayments by issuing cheques directly to BMW Financial Services, except for the following periods:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) April 2014, February 2015, March 2015, July 2015, August 2015 (the “First Period”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) September 2015 to January 2017 (the “Second Period”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In respect of the monthly payments made during the First Period, the Plaintiff claimed that he had paid Spencer cash, after which Spencer had issued cheques to BMW Financial Services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In respect of the Second Period, the Plaintiff alleged that he entered into an oral agreement with one Mr Lim Soon Hwa Lawrence (“Lawrence”), whereby Lawrence would “completely take over sole beneficial ownership, possession and use of the Vehicle” for an agreed price of S$420,000.00 based on the “market value” of the Vehicle in or around July 2015. Lawrence was a friend of the Plaintiff and Spencer. Pursuant to this oral agreement, Lawrence took over the vehicle and paid the Plaintiff the cash amount in excess of the outstanding loans, while also taking over payment of the monthly instalments due to BMW Financial Services during the Second Period.

According to the Defendants, these payments were made by Spencer without any donative intent, nor was there any presumption of advancement in the Plaintiff’s favour.

As the name suggests, a common intention constructive trust arises “where it is clear that there is a common intention among parties as to how their beneficial interests are to be held”: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel</span>”) at [83]. To successfully invoke the common intention constructive trust, the common intention – which subsists either at, or subsequent to, the time the property was acquired – may either be express or inferred; and there must be sufficient and compelling evidence of the express or inferred common intention: <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel </span>at [83] citing <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [160(b)] and [160(f)]. Apart from proving the common intention, detrimental reliance on that common intention must also be shown: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Soon v Ong Chai Koon and others</span> [2022] 2 SLR 457 at [40] – [41]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Where the definition of resulting trusts is concerned, it is perhaps better to focus on the circumstances in which a resulting trust arises as opposed to resorting to descriptions (which may be potentially over-inclusive) or unhelpful metaphors: Christopher Hare and Vincent Ooi, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Trusts Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 2021) at [9-2]. The <span class="font-italic">locus classicus </span>on resulting trusts is Lord Browne Wilkinson’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”), where Lord Browne-Wilkinson set out (at p 708) two scenarios in which a resulting trust would typically arise. The first scenario is where <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span> makes a voluntary payment to <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span> or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span> alone or in the joint names of <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span>. There is a presumption that <span class="font-weight-bold">A </span>did not intend to make a gift to <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span>: the money or property is held on trust for <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span> (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by both <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span>, in shares proportionate to their contributions. This is the “presumed resulting trust”, which is also referred to as the “purchase money resulting trust” or the “purchase price resulting trust”. It should be noted that the presumption is easily rebutted either by the counter-presumption of advancement or by direct evidence of <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span>’s intention to make an outright transfer. The second scenario is where <span class="font-weight-bold">A</span> transfers property to <span class="font-weight-bold">B</span> on express trusts but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest.  This is the automatic resulting trust. I need not say more about the automatic resulting trust in these written grounds because it was common ground between the parties in the present case that we were concerned with the first scenario described by Lord Browne-Wilkinson described (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the “presumed resulting trust”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Insofar as Singapore law is concerned, the doctrinal basis for the resulting trust is the lack of intention analysis advanced by Robert Chambers: as the CA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>noted, that analysis (at [44]) may “potentially provide a more sensible basis for the principled and pragmatic development” of the equitable doctrine of the resulting trust. This lack of intention can either be proven on the facts, or presumed (assuming that the evidence is inconclusive as to the transferor’s intentions – see [66] below). As the CA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>also<span class="font-italic"> </span>noted (at [52]): the “question in every case where the claim is based on the existence of a resulting trust is still whether there is any <span class="font-italic">direct</span> <span class="font-italic">evidence that may adequately reveal the intention of the transferor</span> [emphasis added]”. The CA cited with approval the observations of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Yeow Kelvin</span>”, at [116]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the court <span class="font-weight-bold">could discern a clear intention</span> on the part of the deceased to gift all the moneys in the joint account to the survivor from the evidence before it, <span class="font-weight-bold">then there should be no </span><span class="font-weight-bold">need to apply any presumption of a resulting trust to aid the fact-finding or decision-making process</span>. Only when the court is not able to find any clear intention or if the evidence is inconclusive either way as to what the deceased’s real intention might be, then in this rather limited and exceptional situation (where the evidence is so finely balanced on either side) should the court apply the evidential presumption of a resulting trust to tilt the balance in favour of the estate of the deceased (who solely contributed the moneys in [the] joint account).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is not uncommon for claims of both a common intention constructive trust and a presumed resulting trust to be made in property disputes involving “parties who have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property and who have not executed a declaration of trust as to how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned”. In such cases, the framework for the analysis of such claims was set out by the CA in its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span> (at [160]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Is there sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property? If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (ie, the presumption of resulting trust arises). If the answer is “no”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest is held.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Regardless of whether the answer to (a) is “yes” or “no”, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then: (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is registered in Y’s sole name (ie, Y will be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is registered in their joint names. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Notwithstanding the situation at the time the property was acquired, is there sufficient and compelling evidence of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in a proportion which is different from that in which the beneficial interest was held at the time of acquisition of the property? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in one of the modes set out at (b)–(e) above, depending on which is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, the starting point of the analysis was an examination of whether a presumption of a resulting trust arose on the facts – followed by an examination of whether the parties could be shown to have had a common intention to hold the beneficial interest in different proportions from the proportions of their respective contributions to the purchase price. That being said, the courts in later decisions have taken the position that the analysis need not always proceed in this strict sequence. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang v Wong Sang Woo </span>[2018] SGHC 162 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span>”) observed (at [24]) (see also <span class="font-italic">Yeow</span><span class="font-italic"> Jen Ai Susan v Ravindaranath Kalyana Ramasamy </span>[2021] SGHC 94 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeow</span><span class="font-italic"> Jen Ai Susan</span>”) at [26] – [30]; <span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Koon and </span><span class="font-italic">others v Ong Chai Soon </span>[2021] SGHC 76 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Koon</span>”) at [45] – [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While the approach in Chan Yuen Lan starts its analysis with the purchase price resulting trust, in practice the foremost claim that is put forward is usually the common intention constructive trust, with an alternative basis relied upon of a proprietary estoppel; the resulting trust is usually the backstop claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the present case, the Plaintiff relied on a common intention constructive trust as his foremost claim, with the resulting trust as his backstop claim.

</div> this effectively meant that there would have been three separate common intention constructive trusts: first, from February 2014 to August 2015, there must have been a common intention as between the Plaintiff and Spencer for the former to have the entire beneficial ownership of the Vehicle and for the latter to hold it on trust for him; second, from August 2015 to January 2017, there must have been a common intention as between Lawrence and Spencer for Lawrence to have the entire beneficial ownership of the car and for Spencer to hold it on trust for him; and finally, from January 2017 onwards, there must have been a common intention as between the Plaintiff and Spencer for the Plaintiff once again to have the entire beneficial ownership of the car and for Spencer to hold it on trust for him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, this convoluted narrative – which only emerged in amendments made mid-trial – actually ran contrary to other key portions of his own pleadings, which posited an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and Spencer in late 2013 for the former to have the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> use and beneficial ownership of the car and for the latter to hold it on trust <span class="font-italic">solely</span> for him. It should be highlighted that in the Plaintiff’s original statement of claim, the case he put forward about the arrangements with Lawrence was that he and Lawrence had “orally agreed that in exchange for the Plaintiff allowing Lim [Lawrence] to enjoy the use of the Vehicle during the Second Period [September 2015 to January 2017], Lim was to make the monthly payments [to BMW Financial Services] for the corresponding months on behalf of the Plaintiff”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There was no explanation given as to how his memory had suddenly – and belatedly – been jolted nearly a year after filing his original statement of claim. Moreover, Lawrence’s purported assumption of sole beneficial ownership between August 2015 and January 2017 was a fundamental change in the ownership of the Vehicle and not a mere “detail” which might have easily been forgotten. It made no sense, in any event, that the Plaintiff’s recollection of events occurring in the period between August 2015 and January 2017 should have improved with the passage of <span class="font-italic">more</span> time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Further, the amendments made by the Plaintiff on 12 May 2022 stated that it was pursuant to an oral agreement between him and Lawrence that the latter had “completely” taken over “sole beneficial ownership, possession and use” of the Vehicle – but these amendments said nothing of Spencer’s position vis-à-vis this alleged agreement between the Plaintiff and Lawrence. No evidence was proffered either as to Spencer’s position vis-à-vis this alleged agreement. This was quite incredible since Lawrence could not have taken over sole beneficial ownership of the Vehicle for the fairly lengthy period spanning August 2015 to January 2017 unless Spencer – as the registered owner – had agreed to holding it on trust for Lawrence. Very oddly, the amendments also said nothing about Spencer’s position vis-à-vis the alleged subsequent agreement between the Plaintiff and Lawrence for the former to “take over” once again the over “sole beneficial ownership, possession and use” of the Vehicle in January 2017. Nor was there any evidence of Spencer’s position vis-à-vis this alleged subsequent agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Plaintiff’s silence on Spencer’s response to his alleged oral agreements with Lawrence in August 2015 and in January 2017 was perplexing. It will be recalled that <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, the common intention which he and Spencer shared at the point of acquiring the Vehicle was for Spencer to hold the Vehicle for him and for him to be the sole beneficial owner. At no point in these proceedings did the Plaintiff ever assert that there were changes in the common intention between him and Spencer following the purchase of the Vehicle – and yet if his story at trial were to be believed, there would have had to be changes in the common intention. His inability to explain the position as between him and Spencer in the period between August 2015 and January 2017 – and in particular, the state of the common intention between them in this period – cast doubt on the veracity of his narrative of a common intention constructive trust arising in his favour at the point of purchase.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 While it is true that common intention can be established by subsequent conduct, including the making of direct financial contributions (<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span> at [61]), the evidence available in this case did not bear out the common intention pleaded by the Plaintiff. While it appeared that he did pay at least some of the monthly loan instalments due to BMW Financial Services, the evidence given by Low Gaik Ling Elyn (“Elyn”) – who was Spencer’s personal assistant at the material time and who had been instructed by Spencer to “keep a record of the monthly instalments paid to BMW Financial Services” – was that:

This ran contrary to the Plaintiff’s narrative of the common intention which he and Spencer had shared for him (the Plaintiff) to enjoy sole beneficial ownership of the Vehicle and to be “<span class="font-italic">solely</span> responsible for the contributions towards the payment of the purchase price of the Vehicle”.

</div> As to the Plaintiff’s attempt at trial to explain Lawrence’s payments away as part of an oral agreement between him and Lawrence for the latter to take over sole beneficial ownership of the Vehicle, I have pointed out earlier the disconcerting anomalies in this later narrative (see [25] – [30] above). Indeed, having examined the evidence available, it appeared to me that the Plaintiff’s later story about the “sale” to Lawrence in August 2015 and the further “sale” back from Lawrence in January 2017 was concocted specifically as a means of addressing the incongruities presented by the evidence of Lawrence’s payment of the car loan instalments. As I noted earlier, if this later story were true, it made no sense for the Plaintiff to have omitted all mention of it in his original statement of claim; and it also made no sense for him to have omitted all mention of Spencer’s position vis-à-vis the purported change in beneficial owners.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I noted that in putting forward at trial their story of the two “sales” of the Vehicle between the two of them in August 2015 and January 2017, the Plaintiff and Lawrence claimed that they had computed the purchase price with reference to the then market value of the car, and that they paid each other the “cash amount in excess of the outstanding loans”. I did not find these claims in the least believable. Leaving aside the bare assertions made by the two men, no objective evidence was produced of the not inconsiderable cash payments they claimed to have made to each other; and neither man could recall with any specificity the amounts allegedly paid. In cross-examination, Lawrence conceded that there was no documentary evidence of these cash payments.

</div> It appeared to me that the Plaintiff’s and Lawrence’s evidence about having computed the purchase price of the Vehicle and having paid each other the cash amount in excess of outstanding loans in August 2015 and January 2017 was merely something the pair of them had made up to give some verisimilitude to their story of the two “sales”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other evidential issues in relation to the Plaintiff’s claim of a common intention constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adverse inference drawn against the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I make two other points about the evidence in relation to the Plaintiff’s claim of a common intention constructive trust. The first point concerns the absence of any evidence of his WhatsApp communications with Spencer and Lawrence regarding the purchase and ownership of the Vehicle. While the Plaintiff claimed that the three of them were part of a WhatsApp group chat (“SUP”) and that his intended purchase of the car was discussed within this group chat,

According to the Defendants, this must be because the Plaintiff knew that such evidence – if adduced – would give the lie to his claims about having discussed with Spencer the latter’s acquisition of the Vehicle and their “oral agreement” for him to own the Vehicle beneficially. The Plaintiff and Lawrence, on the other hand, provided the following identical explanations in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”):

If it were indeed the case that they had deleted this group chat after Spencer’s death because they felt sad whenever they looked at it, there was no reason for them to have refrained from saying so in their AEICs and to have instead made up a different (and false) explanation altogether. I agreed with the Defendants that the Plaintiff’s and Lawrence’s various explanations for the disappearance of the group chat simply could not be believed. In other words, I found that this was not a case of the Plaintiff being unable to produce evidence of the WhatsApp group chat: rather, it was a case of his being unwilling to do so. In this connection, I considered whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the Plaintiff, pursuant to s 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Revised Edition) which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may presume existence of certain fact</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116.  The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In considering the application of this provision, I found guidance in the reasoning of the court in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Amin bin Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Taib and others v Lim Choon Thye and others </span>[2011] 2 SLR 343 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed Amin</span>”). This was a case concerning a hearing on costs following the substantive outcome of Originating Summons No 17 of 2008 (“OS 17/2008”), in which the plaintiff subsidiary proprietors had succeeded in their appeal to the High Court have the decision of the Strata Titles Board set aside. Upon the matter being remitted to the Strata Titles Board for a fresh hearing, the plaintiffs’ application for approval of the collective sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) was dismissed by the Board on the ground that the SPA was unstamped. When the parties reappeared before the High Court to address the issue of the costs of OS 17/2008, the plaintiffs argued that since they had succeeded in the substantive appeal in OS 17/2008, they were entitled to their costs. The defendant subsidiary proprietors argued, on the other hand, that the plaintiffs should be deprived of their costs in the appeal because they had failed to ensure the stamping of the SPA. In addition, the defendants submitted that the nature of the fee-paying arrangement between the plaintiffs and their solicitors was such that the plaintiffs were not obliged to pay the latter costs for conducting the action on their behalf. The plaintiffs refused, however, to disclose the terms of their retainer, on the basis that this was covered by privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Amin </span>ruled that there would be no order as to costs. In so ruling, the court noted that the plaintiffs’ own evidence suggested that there had been an agreement by their solicitors not to charge them. While the court could not compel the production of the plaintiffs’ retainer, where a real and relevant dispute of fact arose in argument over costs, the court would require the party claiming costs to prove the facts on which he relied; and it would be for that party to choose what evidence he would adduce and to what extent he would waive his privilege. In <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Amin</span>, the plaintiffs’ refusal to waive their privilege and to disclose the terms of their retainer constituted a failure to prove a fact that was especially within their knowledge. No explanation was provided for their failure. There was thus sufficient ground for the court to draw an adverse inference against them pursuant to s 116, illustration (g) and illustration (h) of the Evidence Act (at [26] – [31] of <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Amin</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the present case, the Plaintiff was the one who had claimed that his discussions with Spencer on the acquisition and ownership of the Vehicle took place, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>within their WhatsApp group chat. As I have explained, given the glaring inconsistencies and oddities in his evidence (and Lawrence’s) regarding the unavailability of the group chat, I found that he was in fact unwilling to produce the group chat. In the circumstances, it should be presumed that evidence of this group chat – if given – would be unfavourable to the Plaintiff’s claims about his alleged discussions with Spencer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 1st Defendant’s initial acknowledgements of the Plaintiff’s interest in the Vehicle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Finally, I add that although the Plaintiff made much of the 1st Defendant Shyller’s admission that she had – following Spencer’s death – initially acknowledged his interest in the Vehicle before doing an about-face,

</div> I did not find this to be fatal to the Defendants’ defence. Shyller was able to provide an explanation for her initial conduct: namely, that she had not had the opportunity, at that point, to go through Spencer’s financial records and had trusted, at that point, what her lawyer Mr Mahtani Bhagwandas (“Mahtani”) told her.

</div> Having examined the evidence adduced, however, I found that the Plaintiff could not discharge the burden of proving he had made “<span class="font-italic">all</span> financial contributions” for the Vehicle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 First, the objective documentary evidence showed that Spencer had made a considerable number of payments towards the purchase of the car. The Plaintiff himself admitted that it was Spencer who paid Munich Automobiles the initial deposit of $30,000 on 19 February 2014; and it was also Spencer who made a credit card payment of $236,000 to Munich Automobiles on 26 February 2014.

</div> Conversely, the Plaintiff’s assertion that he had reimbursed Spencer in cash for these payments was not borne out by the evidence. According to the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, as at February 2014, he had already paid Spencer a total of $266,000 to reimburse the latter for payments made in that period.

</div> However, not only did Spencer’s bank statements fail to reveal cash deposits totalling this alleged sum of $260,000, as the Defendants observed, there was no evidence to show that the Plaintiff’s cash withdrawals were connected to payments to Spencer. Critically, the Plaintiff claimed in his affidavit that he had given Spencer $266,000.00 before 19 February 2014, but in cross-examination, he was unable to explain why the sum of $30,000.00 which alleged formed part of the $266,000.00

Pressed to explain the fact that his withdrawal of $30,000 had only occurred on 26 February 2014, he first volunteered a version of events in which he had taken $30,000 from his father to pay Spencer before withdrawing the same amount from his own account and returning it to his father. This was a version of events which had never been mentioned in his AEIC. When asked to elaborate, he promptly declared himself unable to remember – only to fall back on the story about taking the money from his father when it became clear that he had no other explanation as to why his own withdrawal of the $30,000 had come about on 26 February 2014.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further and in any event, even if I were to ignore the fact that the Plaintiff’s withdrawal of $30,000 took place only after he had allegedly paid Spencer the sum of $266,000 in cash, no evidence could be found to show that the amount of $30,000 was conveyed to Spencer either in the form of cash or via a cheque deposited into Spencer’s bank account. Indeed, this was the case for the rest of the cash withdrawals from the Plaintiff’s accounts, which allegedly made up the sum of $260,000.00 paid to Spencer in cash: in cross-examination, the Plaintiff himself conceded that leaving aside the bare assertions in his AEIC, there was no evidence to show that he had passed Spencer such a sum in cash.

</div> neither the Plaintiff’s counsel nor the Defendants’ counsel followed up with any substantive legal arguments on this point. If the Plaintiff’s counsel was attempting to suggest that such mixing of funds <span class="font-italic">per se </span>precluded a resulting trust from arising, I did not think this could be correct as a matter of principle (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> In re </span><span class="font-italic">Oatway</span> [1903] 2 Ch. 356); nor did the Plaintiff’s counsel cite any authorities which might support such a proposition.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The argument of time-bar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Having said that, the Defendants’ counterclaim – or a substantial portion of their counterclaim – did face a fundamental objection in the form of the Plaintiff’s pleaded defence of time-bar. In this connection, as both parties in the present case acknowledged, our courts have previously held that the Limitation Act applies to resulting trusts.

This was a reference to s 3 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed), which defines the terms “trust” and “trustees” as including “implied and constructive trusts, and ... cases where the trustee has a beneficial interest in the trust property, and to the duties incident to the office of a personal representative”. In both <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Soon</span> (at [249] – [250]) and <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Leh</span> (at [163] – [167]), the High Court held that although this definition did not include resulting trusts, it was an inclusive definition and not an exhaustive one; and in the court’s view, the weight of authority suggested that resulting trusts were dealt with on the same footing as express and constructive trusts for the purposes of the section.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Both parties in the present case also acknowledged that our courts have previously held that a beneficiary’s action for an account is caught by s 6(2) of the Limitation Act applies.

</div> Given the context, I understood the Plaintiff’s answer to be in effect a statement that he actually had no recollection (or “no idea”, as he put it) what the purpose of Spencer’s payments was and he believed the monies in the UOB account to be his own monies. I did not think this answer <span class="font-italic">per se </span>was enough for me to conclude that when the Plaintiff spent monies from the UOB account, he must have used the trust monies – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the deposits from Spencer – to pay for such expenditure.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In this respect, the Defendants’ position was not dissimilar from that of the plaintiff beneficiary in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Leh. </span>In that case, the plaintiff – in seeking to rely on the conversion limb under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act – had argued that the defendant must have used trust money to pay for her own investments because she did not herself have the financial resources to pay for investments such as shares and foreign commercial property. Some evidence was adduced by the plaintiff of the cost of those investments as well as the overdrawn state of the defendant’s bank account at the time of her purchase of the foreign commercial property. The court was asked to infer that the defendant must therefore have used trust money to pay for these purchases. However, the court declined to draw such inference and instead rejected the plaintiff’s allegation for want of evidence (<span class="font-italic">Lim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Leh</span> at [225] – [226]). In the present case, as I have noted, the Defendants adduced no evidence at all of the alleged conversion: they could point only to the Plaintiff’s receipt of the various sums (a fact insufficient in itself to suggest conversion, let alone to prove it), as well as one of the answers he gave in cross-examination (an answer both vague and taken out of context).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the reasons set out above, I found that the Defendants were unable to rely on either the possession limb or the conversion limb of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act; that s 6(2) therefore applied to monies paid by Spencer in 2014; and that the Defendants’ counterclaim in respect of the five 2014 payments was time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Counterclaim for the remaining three payments made between 21 October 2015 and 23 May 2017 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Leaving aside the time-barred 2014 payments, I address next the remaining three payments made between 21 October 2015 and 23 May 2017. These three payments made up a total of $203,600.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At the outset, as I noted earlier, I did not think it could be seriously disputed that these three payments were in fact made by Spencer to the Plaintiff’s UOB account. In gist, to recapitulate, the Defendants wanted a declaration that the Plaintiff held the amounts on trust for them; and they also wanted the Plaintiff to give an account of the monies received and then to pay back these amounts “or such amount as the court may deem just”.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I should first make it clear that I was unable to accept the Plaintiff’s explanation (in the alternative) that the monies from Spencer were repayments of loans from the Plaintiff. This was because leaving aside self-serving bare assertions, the Plaintiff could not produce any evidence of these purportedly substantial loans. Indeed, he could not even be certain of the amount he had lent Spencer: at one point in cross-examination, he stated that he had lent Spencer “close to a million”, but was unable to say what the balance amount of $108,076 Spencer might have been for.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Unfortunately, the Defendants appeared to assume that so long as they could show the payment of monies by Spencer to the Plaintiff, a resulting trust would be established, and this would entitle them to the reliefs they sought. I did not think this could be right.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, as I alluded to earlier, the presumption of a resulting is but a mere <span class="font-italic">presumption</span>. This presumption does not operate in cases where there is direct evidence revealing the intention of parties: in essence, the presumption is “no more than a long stop to provide the answer when the relevant facts and circumstances fail to yield a solution”: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [36]. Moreover, as Lord Browne-Wilkinson made clear in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at p 708), the presumption is “<span class="font-italic">easily rebutted</span> either by the counter-presumption of advancement or by direct evidence of A’s [the transferor or payor] intention to make an outright transfer”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the present case, the Defendants relied on the mere fact that Spencer had transferred these monies to the Plaintiff, without more: they did not adduce <span class="font-italic">any</span> evidence at all (whether<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the form of text and WhatsApp messages, emails, or other documentary evidence) of the circumstances or the context in which these transfers were made. Against this, there was the undeniable fact that Spencer had for years made various fund transfers to the Plaintiff without apparently requesting any repayment at any point in time – or even maintaining a clear record of these fund transfers. The complete absence of any such documentation should be contrasted with Spencer’s conduct in relation to the BMW M6 car, where there was evidence that Spencer had instructed Elyn to maintain detailed records of instalment payments made by the Plaintiff towards the vehicle loan in Spencer’s name, for the periods that the Plaintiff was using the car (see [31] above). If Spencer had in fact always intended that the Plaintiff should not have the benefit of the funds transferred into his account, it seemed to me quite unbelievable that Spencer should have omitted to maintain similarly clear records of the transfers and the repayment details.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the circumstances, even setting aside the Plaintiff’s alternative story of loan repayments and even without a presumption of advancement in his favour, what evidence I could actually see of Spencer’s conduct over the period in which the fund transfers were made spoke to an intention to make outright transfers. In other words, even assuming the Defendants were able to rely on a presumption of resulting trust based on the mere fact of funds having been transferred by Spencer to the Plaintiff, such a presumption was in my view capable of being rebutted when all the evidence available was weighed up in the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I add that the present case was unusual because of the dearth of any evidence proffered by the party purporting to claim the benefit of a resulting trust. While it might seem tempting to sympathise with the practical difficulties the Defendants faced in mustering evidence relating to the fund transfers, to allow them to succeed on their resulting trust claim would have potentially unsettling repercussions beyond the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>, the CA<span class="font-italic"> </span>took the view (at [44] and [48]) that the lack-of-intention analysis might provide a more sensible basis for the principled and pragmatic development of the equitable doctrine of resulting trusts – but notably, the court also cautioned against an “unduly wide doctrine of resulting trusts” which could potentially blur the “distinction between claims based on unjust enrichment and claims based on resulting trusts” and cause “unsettling effects on the rights of third parties and the security of commercial transactions”.

</div> have advanced the argument that the resulting trust is an appropriate response to unjust enrichment claims. However, this argument has not been judicially endorsed: in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>, for example, Lord Goff declined to grant a declaration of a resulting trust over money which had been paid pursuant to a void contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the reasons explained, I was not minded to grant the Defendants a declaration that the Plaintiff held the sum of $1,108, 076.00 on trust for them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Further, and in any event, even assuming the existence of a presumed resulting trust, the Defendants still bore the burden of proving that the Plaintiff – as a trustee under a presumed resulting trust – owed them fiduciary duties including the duty to account for the monies: <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Leh </span>at [138], citing the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>, the CA reviewed a number of authorities and academic texts in detail before coming to the following conclusions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">205  …<span class="font-weight-bold">First</span>, there is no one set of obligations that pertains to all fiduciaries – not even persons who undertake those obligations in the course of an express trusteeship. This is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>the case for resulting trustees, if they do indeed owe fiduciary duties at all. If we recall Prof Finn’s observations (see above at [193]), the finding of a resulting trust is only part – in fact, the beginning – of the analysis as to <span class="font-italic">whether </span>and <span class="font-italic">what </span>fiduciary duties are owed. <span class="font-weight-bold">Second</span>, these obligations are entered into <span class="font-italic">voluntarily </span>and such a finding will be arrived at by <span class="font-italic">objectively </span>assessing the conduct of the person who is said to be a fiduciary. The precise content of these duties are to be deduced from the surrounding circumstances, including, and especially, any relationship between the parties. <span class="font-weight-bold">Third</span>, there is no doubt that <span class="font-italic">express </span>trustees owe fiduciary duties. The duty to perform the trust honestly and to act in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries is <span class="font-italic">at the same time </span>an irreducible core duty of the trust and a duty that is fiduciary in nature. In this context, the fiduciary duty arises not from the trustee-beneficiary relationship <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, but from the <span class="font-italic">voluntary undertaking to the settlor </span>to manage the trust property not for the trustee’s own benefit but for the benefit of the beneficiaries. <span class="font-weight-bold">Fourth</span>, the situation with regard to <span class="font-italic">resulting </span>trustees evidently poses more problems.  Resulting trusts arise in at least two situations, possibly more. It can be seen, especially from Prof Chambers’s work (see above at [200]), that resulting trustees can be located on a continuum. At one end are the innocent recipients of property, and at the other end are recipients of property which forms the subject of a failed express trust. It is therefore conceivable that a person who becomes a resulting trustee on the basis of a failed express trust may still owe fiduciary duties; we agree with Prof Chambers and Prof Virgo that it is generally difficult to say that that undertaking to act in another’s benefit – or in more abstract terms the undertaking to act in self-denial – should cease when that express trust fails. However, it may well be the case that the precise obligations which are owed <span class="font-italic">to the settlor-beneficiary </span>in a resulting trust are different from (and almost invariably narrower than) those owed in respect of the beneficiaries in an express trust.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">206  The real question, in our view, is whether, objectively speaking, the resulting trustee can be said to have undertaken (whether expressly or impliedly) to act in a particular way which is fiduciary in nature. In this regard, the knowledge that one does not hold the beneficial interest in the property is, while not a sufficient condition by itself, strictly necessary because the conscience cannot otherwise be affected in a way that equity can take cognisance of. The duties that are applicable to each resulting trustee will vary significantly, and are very fact-specific. The duties owed by a resulting trustee to the settlor-beneficiary will, however, almost invariably be narrower than the duties owed by an express trustee in relation to the beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">207   It should be noted that the fact that a fiduciary duty may be imposed on a <span class="font-italic">fact-specific </span>basis ought <span class="font-italic">not </span>to be perceived as being arbitrary in any way. In addition to the perceptive observations by Prof Finn (see above at [193]), the observations by Justice Edelman (see above at [193]) might also be usefully noted – at least in so far as both observations suggest that the mere existence of a fiduciary <span class="font-italic">relationship, without more</span>, would <span class="font-italic">not necessarily </span>give rise to fiduciary <span class="font-italic">duties</span>. As we shall see in a moment, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the facts and circumstances are also of the first importance in order to ascertain whether or not a fiduciary duty ought to be imposed even where there already exists an established fiduciary relationship between the parties concerned</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Bearing in mind the CA’s injunction that the duties applicable to each resulting trustee “will vary significantly” and are “very fact-specific”, the onus is on the plaintiff claiming the benefit of the resulting trust in each case to adduce enough evidence of the specific fiduciary duties applicable to the defendant resulting trustee and to establish the defendant’s alleged breach of these fiduciary duties and their own entitlement to the reliefs sought. Thus, for example, in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Ah Leh</span>, the High Court found that the plaintiff beneficiary in that case was able to establish that there was a duty on the defendant’s part to account because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, he was able to show that he had an ongoing arrangement with the defendant for the latter to assist him in managing and investing the monies he paid her; that he reposed a high degree of trust in her to manage and invest his money; and that between 1993 and 2007 the defendant had updated him on the status of his investments whenever he asked for information. Even then, the court found the plaintiff’s claim time-barred; and the court held in addition that quite apart from the time-bar, it would have exercised its discretion not to order the defendant to render an account to the plaintiff because it would have been oppressive to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the present case, although the Defendants pleaded in their counterclaim that the Plaintiff was “now liable to account” to them for the amounts paid to him, they did not plead any material facts which went towards establishing the Plaintiff’s alleged assumption of fiduciary duties including the duty to give an account. Nor was there any evidence adduced by the Defendants to demonstrate the Plaintiff’s assumption of such fiduciary duties. Indeed, both in her AEIC and her oral testimony, the 1st Defendant Shyller appeared to take it for granted that because the Plaintiff had received these funds from Spencer, it must <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> follow that he had a duty to account for the monies – when in fact the onus was on her to prove that the Plaintiff had assumed such fiduciary duties. It might well be that given the passage of time, the Defendants found it challenging to locate evidence showing the true nature of the dealings between Spencer and the Plaintiff. It might also not be wholly unexpected for the Defendants to feel that the Plaintiff, as the person who received the monies from Spencer, should be the one obliged to give an explanation as to any use made of the monies. However, the fact remained that as Defendants were the plaintiffs in the counterclaim and as they had put forward a case of resulting trust, they bore both the legal burden and the evidential burden of proving the elements of their case. To shift that evidential burden to the Plaintiff (who was the defendant in the counterclaim), the Defendants had first to produce at least some evidence (not inherently incredible) of the existence on the Plaintiff’s part of fiduciary duties, including the duty to account (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [60]). The failure to adduce any evidence at all in this respect was, in my view, fatal to the Defendants’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 By way of a final observation on the evidence: I noted that there was some evidence adduced in the course of the trial which suggested that Spencer and the Plaintiff had been jointly involved in a number of businesses; and that these businesses included – according to Spencer’s former solicitor Mahtani – the junket business.

</div> This was a business which the Plaintiff described as being largely cash-based, since it involved frequent transfers of cash to and from the junket operator’s customers.

</div> It was not clear to me whether Spencer’s and the Plaintiff’s involvement in the junket business provided an explanation of some sort for the various sums of money transferred by Spencer to the latter’s bank account at various points in time; and the Plaintiff did not follow up on this part of his narrative, at least in relation to the counterclaim in S 438 (perhaps unsurprisingly in view of his concerns over IRAS’ scrutiny of his sources of income and cash flow). Ultimately, I did not make any firm findings in this respect, since it was not necessary for me to come to any finding on the specific reason(s) for the funds transfers made by Spencer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Given my findings at [51] to [75] above, I concluded that the Defendants’ counterclaim in S 438 could not be sustained; and I accordingly dismissed their counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In light of the decision I arrived at on both the claim and the counterclaim in S 438, I was of the view that in all fairness, the Plaintiff and the Defendants should each bear their own costs of these proceedings. I therefore ordered that the Plaintiff and the Defendants should each bear their own costs of the proceedings in S 438.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Oommen Mathew and See Wern Hao (Omni Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chiok Beng Piow and Margaret Lee Hui Zhen (AM Legal LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
