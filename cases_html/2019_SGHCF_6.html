They had registered their marriage in Singapore in late 1974, and have a son (“the Son”) who is now in his forties.  He is married and has a son (“the grandson”).  The Plaintiff (“the Wife”) commenced divorce proceedings against the Defendant (“the Husband”) on 2 November 2011 on the ground that he had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him (“unreasonable behaviour”). While the Husband did not dispute that the marriage had broken down, he contested the Wife’s claim and filed a counterclaim that the marriage should be dissolved on two grounds – the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour, and that Parties had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the Writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Interim Judgment was eventually granted on 29 May 2015 to dissolve the marriage on both the claim and counterclaim based on the grounds of the Parties’ respective unreasonable behaviour, some 41 years after the marriage was registered. The ancillary matters of the division of the matrimonial assets, including the matrimonial home, maintenance for the Wife, and costs were adjourned to chambers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background of the Parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Husband is a director at a company which is in the business of printing and publishing.

This was because of the number of amendments to the pleadings by the Parties, and the long time they took to amend them. For example, the Defence and Counterclaim that was first filed on 12 March 2012 was amended on 9 May 2012 and then again on 12 January 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 After Interim Judgment was granted, the Parties filed 3 applications for discovery and interrogatories, and also applied for an extension of time to file responses.  In addition, the Parties filed applications to strike out affidavits, to appoint an independent forensic accountant, and to file further affidavits.  The Parties attended mediation twice as well.  In the result, the hearing for the ancillary matters took place only in April and May 2018.

The considerations that are to be taken into account when making the division are set out in s 112(2), and include the matters that are relevant for the assessment of maintenance of the wife, as set out in s 114(1).

The global assessment methodology “consists of four distinct phases: <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, identification, assessment, division and apportionment”. The classification methodology involves “an assimilation of all four of the above steps into a broad judicial discretion which, in the first instance, separately considers and divides classes of matrimonial assets”. The Court of Appeal explained that while there is “much to be said for either method, both of which are consistent with the legislative framework provided by s 112 of the Act”, in the final analysis, the court should apply the methodology that achieves the paramount aim of ensuring that the matrimonial assets are divided in a just and equitable manner (at [33]). For the reasons set out later in this judgment at [54] to [55], I have applied the global assessment methodology in the division of the matrimonial assets of the Parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Identification and Assessment of the matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I deal first with the identification of the matrimonial assets and the assessment of their net values.

As the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 held at [39], once an asset “is regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided, then for the purposes of determining its value, it must be assessed as at the date of the hearing”.

The same court appointed valuer valued it at $4,200,000 as at 28 June 2018, and I adopt this as the valuation of the Jalan B Property. Since the Wife and the Son are joint tenants of this property, in the absence of any evidence of what their respective beneficial interests are, I take each of them to hold a half share in the property.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”), the Court of Appeal held at [24] that when divorce proceedings are imminent, substantial expenditures incurred by one spouse, whether by gift or otherwise, without the consent of the other spouse should be returned to the asset pool. This is regardless of whether the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets or for the benefit of children. Here, the shares were disposed of by the Wife shortly before or soon after the writ was filed, and no adequate explanation was provided on where the sale proceeds went. Accordingly, the amount of $110,485.03 will be added into the pool of matrimonial assets.  In so deciding, I do not accept the Wife’s submission that this amount should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets because she had suffered a loss upon the sale of the shares. This is because it is the current value of the asset, as represented by sale price, that has to be divided. If the Wife is correct, then any asset that has depreciated in value would never be available for division, irrespective of the current value. By way of illustration, if the value of the only asset of a divorcing couple that was purchased for $2 million has dropped to $1 million, it would not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division, and will be retained by the spouse in whose name it belongs. This would not be correct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Gold bars and souvenir coins</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Husband submitted that he had left some gold bars and souvenir coins in his room in the Jalan B Property before he moved out but has since been unable to find them.

I do not think the matters relied on by the Husband were sufficient to warrant the companies being excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. It is not uncommon for spouses to divide their roles, with one concentrating on being the financial provider while the other concentrates on domestic matters. The refusal by the Wife to act as a guarantor was because she could not do so, being a civil servant.

She said that the Court Expert considered three different methods of valuing the Company Property, the Direct Comparison Approach, the Market Approach and the Discounted Cash Flow Approach.  While the Direct Comparison Approach would value the property at $8 million, the Market Approach would value it at $5.6 million and the Discounted Cash Flow Approach would value it at $5.6 million, the Court Expert valued the property at $6.4 million.

There was a suit commenced in Australia for the AUD500,000 as the amount was frozen by a third party.  The Court of Appeal of Victoria, Australia held that the AUD500,000 was for repayment of a loan owed to the third party and as such it did not form part of the assets of Company E.  Accordingly, Company E did not have any assets at the time it was wound up.

The other expenses were for minor renovations, the general upkeep of the property, purchase of furniture and appliances which added up to a relatively insignificant sum. If indeed the only obstacle holding the Husband back from transferring the property was to avoid incurring stamp fees, one would have expected the Husband to have done his calculations on the costs of such transfer.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Notes of Argument of 18 April 2018, p 1.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There, the Court of Appeal laid out a structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets. That structured approach was succinctly summarised in <span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1137 (“<span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span>”) at [21] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions (“Step 2”); and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) (“Step 3”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I will apply this structured approach in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Global assessment methodology vs Classification methodology </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span> [2016] SGHCF 9 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span>”), the Court held that the classification approach would be appropriate where there were multiple classes of assets to which the parties had made different contributions and some assets were not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represented.  The Court held further at [39] and [40] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 The first methodology, "the global assessment methodology", is far more commonly used than the “classification methodology”. Pursuant to the classification methodology, only the direct contributions may vary. The classification approach “would be appropriate where there are multiple classes of assets, and where the parties have made different contributions” to each class: <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span><span class="font-italic"> (2007)</span> at [35]. The weightage accorded to indirect contributions must remain constant in relation to each class of assets, since indirect contributions can only be assessed and applied at the end of the marriage: <span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR</span> <span class="font-italic">and another matter</span> [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [22] to [23]. The court must avoid the “blinkered” approach where “varying weights are accorded for indirect contributions in different matrimonial asset classes” (at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 Since the presence of different direct contributions to different assets has never stood in the way of a court dividing the matrimonial assets globally, there must be something more to indicate that the classification methodology may be the more suitable approach. In my view, assets can be separately divided if some are not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represents. Professor Leong Wai Kum stated in Elements of Family Law in Singapore (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“Elements”) at p 577 that “[t]he power to divide matrimonial assets is driven by the motive to share the gains of the marital partnership as fairly as possible between the former marital partners” [emphasis added]. In Professor Leong’s view, there is a meaningful distinction to be made between “quintessential matrimonial assets”, which are assets that wholly represent the gains of the marital partnership, and those which are not. She describes assets acquired during the marriage by the efforts of one or both parties as “quintessential” matrimonial assets (Elements at p 557).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Husband submitted that pursuant to the approach laid out in <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span>, the classification methodology would be appropriate for the Husband’s shareholdings in the six companies and his foreign properties.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Wife’s Brief Supplemental Submissions dated 19 April 2018, p 1, para 1.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Amongst the reasons she provided in support was that the London and Johore Properties which the Husband claimed to be holding on trusts for others were not, in fact, trust properties. Given that there had been no substantive submissions on how the classification methodology is to be applied, particularly on how the other assets are to be classified and what the Parties’ direct contributions were in some of the assets like jewellery and cars, I found that there was little to no utility in applying the classification methodology. I have found that the London and Johore Properties were not trust properties, but belonged to the Husband. For his shareholding in the companies, the Wife has not claimed to make any direct contributions, so that dealing with them as a separate class would not have made any difference, as indirect contributions are applied across the board to all classes of assets in any event (see <span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR</span> [2013] 1 SLR 476, at [22] – [24]). Requesting for further submissions on the point would only draw out an already long fought legal battle. In the circumstances, I will adopt the global assessment methodology. I note that the Court of Appeal has observed in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> (2007) at [35] that in the vast majority of cases, “either approach would likely achieve the same result”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ direct contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Given that there is not always evidence of the Parties’ direct contributions in the acquisitions of the various matrimonial assets, I am constrained to use the value of a party’s share in an asset as a proxy of his or her direct contribution in the acquisition of those assets. For consistency, where there is evidence of the Parties’ direct contributions, I have used the ratio of the direct contributions to apportion the value of that asset between the Parties. I then attribute the apportioned values as the Parties’ respective direct contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the amount of $304.27 in the POSB Account No ending with 7029, even though it is held jointly by the Wife and the Son, Parties have agreed that the amount in the account is a matrimonial asset. Since there is no claim on it by the Son, I will attribute it to the Wife solely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the Jalan J Property, the Wife submitted that her CPF statement as at 6 October 2017 shows that she had utilised $172,400.00 towards its payment.

</div> While the Husband accepted that the Wife did make this payment, he claimed that he had repaid her in cash for the entire sum. Hence, he took the view that the Wife did not make any direct contributions towards the purchase of the Jalan J Property.

The extent of the inquiries which an applicant should make would have to depend on the facts and circumstances prevailing in the case.” [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I accept the Wife’s submissions and the Court Expert’s evidence on the failure to provide the various documents of the companies that were required for their valuation. Accordingly, I find that the Husband did not make full and frank disclosure of material facts pertaining to the six companies which would have affected their valuations.  In dealing with the Husband’s lack of full and frank disclosure, I found helpful the following comments of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">TYS v TYT</span> [2017] 5 SLR 244:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 As explained earlier, I decided to use the uplift approach to address the adverse inference because it was not practicable to come to a finite sum for the Husband’s non-disclosure. The cases adopting an uplift approach cover a broad range of facts. In <span class="font-italic">Au</span> <span class="font-italic">Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo</span> [2007] SGHC 150, the High Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In <span class="font-italic">Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</span> [2011] 4 SLR 875, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% of all the remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was separately divided. While the general uplift approach may be criticised as being arbitrary since there is no objective value to which it may take reference (<span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span> at [120]), I considered that some degree of arbitrariness was inevitable as adverse inferences were drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information, and discarding the uplift approach entirely may create a perverse incentive for parties to tactically craft non-attributable non-disclosure. In the final analysis, much would depend on the facts, and in determining the appropriate uplift, the court will be guided by, inter alia, the evidence before it as to the extent of non-disclosure relative to the value of the disclosed assets.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 On the facts of this case, this was not an extraordinarily long marriage nor was the asset pool extraordinarily large. If equal weightage was given to both direct and indirect limbs, the final division ratio would be 55:45 in favour of the Husband. In my judgment, two factors called for a more unusual order in this case: (a) the adverse inference drawn against the Husband’s financial position, and (b) the needs of the family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I accept also the Husband’s arguments that the Wife did not sufficiently explain or account for how she spent her retirement gratuities and the sale proceeds of the shares.  However, since I have returned the unaccounted sums to the pool of matrimonial assets for division (see [26] and [28] above), no further adverse inference needs to be drawn against the Wife for these two groups of assets beyond the findings that I have made above. While I also do not think her response that the money she received from the insurance policies had gone into household expenses was adequate in explaining where this amount went,

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> provided the following guidance on the ordering of maintenance for a wife:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 The Husband’s position on appeal is that no maintenance should be awarded to the Wife. On the other hand, the Wife, while accepting the monthly sum of $3,000 as “reasonable”, contends that the multiplier should be 19 years instead, giving a total sum of $684,000. The Wife’s basis for a 19-year multiplier is this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee </span>[2012] 4 SLR 405, where we followed (at [89]) the method of quantifying an appropriate multiplier for a lump sum maintenance award set out in our earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau Poo </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 545 (at [35]). This method involves taking a compromise between the average life expectancy of a woman and the usual retirement age of a Singapore male worker less the wife’s present age, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, [(average life expectancy of a woman + usual retirement age of a Singapore male worker) ÷ 2] – the wife’s present age (“the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng </span>method”).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 Whilst not proposing to discard the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng</span> method altogether, we do not think that the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng</span> method was intended by this court to be the only method of quantifying the appropriate multiplier for a lump sum maintenance award. In this regard, we agree with the Husband’s submission that the <span class="font-italic">Ong Chen Leng</span> method is simply a guide rather than a rule of law. Ultimately, the award of maintenance is a multi-factorial inquiry which, pursuant to s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”), requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters listed in s 114(1)(a) to (g) of the WC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …..</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 Additionally, as noted by the Judge, the court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD and another appeal</span> [2016] SGCA 2 at [33]). Consequently, if, from the division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain the wife, the award of maintenance should be no more than what is necessary to allow the wife to, in the words of the Judge, “weather the transition of the divorce” (GD at [77]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 In the present case, we have held that the wife is entitled to an equal share of the substantial pool of matrimonial assets. We note, too, that the Husband supported the Wife up till mid-2015. Although the Judge was alive to both these factors, we find her multiplier of five years to be on the generous side. Accordingly, we order that the Husband pay the Wife a lump sum maintenance of $100,000, which is approximately the sum obtained using a multiplier of three years, which we consider to be more appropriate. The Husband shall pay this sum on completion of the sale of the matrimonial home or within nine months, whichever is earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Considering the factors listed in s 114(1)(a) to (g) of the WC and the guidance provided in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, I am not inclined to order any maintenance for the Wife.  The foremost consideration is that, as the Husband submitted, the Court’s power to order maintenance is “supplementary” to its power to divide matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span> [2016] SGCA 2 (“<span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span>”) at [33]).  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span> also emphasised at [31] that “the overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage – but … s 114(2) had to be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In the present case, it is key to note that the Wife will receive a significant share of the large pool of matrimonial assets which includes substantial liquid assets.  As I pointed out at the start of my judgment, this is a case which involves two septuagenarians. In the circumstances, the amount of matrimonial assets awarded to the Wife should see her through her twilight years, and a separate lump sum for maintenance will not be necessary. Nor would an order for periodic maintenance be appropriate having regard to the age of the Husband and his many health problems. Even though he is still earning an income, it is not certain how much longer he will be able to continue such payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I will hear Parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sivanathan Wijaya Ravana (R S Wijaya &amp; Co) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Kee Lay Lian and Ada Chua (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
