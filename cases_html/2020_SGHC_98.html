Pursuant to the accused’s instructions, Shanmugam had the Controlled Drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking them with Suief (“the Drug Transaction”).

</div> If true, this would mean that the accused could not have recruited the Shanmugam and Suief to be his drug couriers, introduced Shanmugam to Suief on 12 October 2011, passed the Kenari car to Shanmugam or provided the Couriers with instructions for the transport and delivery of the Controlled Drugs on 28 October 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I find this to be wholly unbelievable. It is patently clear on the facts that the accused had a relationship with Shanmugam and Suief, and that the accused was the only shared link between them. The Couriers were able to provide some personal details about the accused. They also gave detailed and textured accounts of how they met the accused and their interactions with him. In contrast, the accused was unable to offer any explanation as to the Couriers’ accounts apart from a bare denial of his association with them.

</div> I thus reject the accused’s bare and unsubstantiated assertion and find that he had a relationship with each of the Couriers. I also find that the Couriers did not have any relationship with each other <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the accused’s personal introduction of Shanmugam to Suief on 12 October 2011, an event that led to the Couriers’ second meeting with each other 16 days later on 28 October 2011 when both the Couriers were arrested at Pandan Gardens for drug trafficking activities. During the 16 days between 12 October 2011 and 28 October 2011, the Couriers never met each other again and thus, they did not have much of a relationship to speak of, even <span class="font-italic">after</span> the introduction by the accused. It appears also from the Couriers’ evidence that for these two meetings of the Couriers on 12 and 28 October 2011, the only mutual link between them was the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I note, <span class="font-italic">in passing</span>, that the accused’s blatant statement that he did not know the Couriers amounts to a Lucas lie that is capable of corroborating the accused’s guilt (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi</span> [2015] SGCA 33 at [60] which sets out the requirements for a Lucas lie to amount to a corroboration of evidence of guilt). The lie was deliberate as it was repeated in the accused’s statements to the CNB and again at trial. If true, this statement is capable of completely extricating the accused from the Couriers’ drug trafficking activities and thus relates to a material issue. The accused’s assertion that he did not know the Couriers has been proven false by independent evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the testimonies of the Couriers and the Phone Records). Simply put, there was no reason for the accused to fabricate such a blatant lie except for the realisation of his guilt and a fear of the truth. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The evidential status of the Phone Records</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 A simple perusal of the Phone Records reveals that numerous calls and messages transpired between the Mobile Phone Number and the Couriers.

Secondly, and far more significantly, it gives the party calling the witness the opportunity to call corroborative evidence which in the absence of such a challenge is unlikely to have been called. Thirdly, it gives the witness opportunity both to explain or to qualify his own evidence in the light of the contradiction of which warning has been given and also, if he can, to explain or to qualify the other evidence upon which the challenge is to be based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The rule is not necessarily satisfied by a formulaic recitation of a party’s case to the witness, with an invitation merely to agree or disagree. Rather, in evaluating any given objection, consideration should be given to the totality of evidence in the case. The rule does not require every point to be put to a witness but this would generally be required when the submission is at the “very heart of the matter” (see <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [42] citing <span class="font-italic">Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 326 at [40]). Furthermore, a failure to do so may mean that the court may consider the unchallenged testimony to be undisputed by the opposing party and thus accepted (see <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 1 SLR 606 at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the Prosecution should have referred the accused to the Phone Records and put it directly to him that he had owned a SIM card with the Mobile Phone Number and had used it to give instructions to the Couriers for the Drug Transaction. However, it does not mean that the Prosecution is thus precluded from relying on the Phone Records as <span class="font-italic">corroborative evi</span><span class="font-italic">dence</span> of the Couriers’ testimonies that the accused was the only person linking them up and making the arrangements for the Drug Transaction, and that the accused had used the Mobile Phone Number to do so. Neither does it mean that I am prepared to accept the accused’s testimony that he had never owned a SIM card with the Mobile Phone Number at any time, and therefore he could not possibly have made any arrangements with the Couriers for the Drug Transaction.

</div> As the Mobile Phone Number, shown as “+60164978192” on the mobile phone records of both Couriers also ends with a “92”, the accused’s own evidence clearly is that he never owned the Mobile Phone Number. At trial, the Prosecution expended considerable time and effort to show that both Shanmugam and Suief <span class="font-italic">separately</span> associated the Mobile Phone Number solely with the accused (see below at [57]). The Prosecution’s challenge to the accused that he owned and used the Mobile Phone Number to contact the Couriers was made quite clear to him, albeit not directly put to him. I accept, however, that the ownership of the Mobile Phone Number is nevertheless <span class="font-italic">one part</span> of the overall evidence led by the Prosecution. It goes towards proving a crucial factual element – that it was the accused who had made the drug trafficking arrangements and given instructions for the Drug Transaction. This had been adequately put to the accused by the Prosecution (see [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, it was patently obvious to the accused what the Prosecution’s case is, namely that the accused communicated with and gave instructions to the Couriers for the Drug Transaction via the Mobile Phone Number. Given that the accused’s defence is a complete denial of any involvement in the Drug Transaction, “it could not be said that the failure to put the question to the [accused] resulted in any procedural unfairness to him, in the sense that he had been deprived of an opportunity to explain his evidence which would amount to nothing more than another denial” (<span class="font-italic">Awtar</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh </span>([49] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In light of the foregoing, I thus find that the Prosecution’s lapse does not preclude it from submitting firstly that the accused contacted the Couriers and gave them instructions pertaining to the Drug Transaction, and secondly that the accused had done so through the Mobile Phone Number.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The owner of the Mobile Phone Number</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any event, the totality of the evidence leads me to the irresistible inference that the accused was the one communicating with the Couriers through the Mobile Phone Number. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Suief gave clear and unequivocal evidence that the Mobile Phone Number belonged to the accused and was the only number used by him to contact Suief.

It is also corroborated by the Phone Records, the travel movement records from the ICA (“ICA records”) in relation to both Shanmugam and the accused and Shanmugam’s testimony (when it could be relied upon). Ignoring the inconsistencies arising from his evidence during the HC 2014 Trial, the remaining inconsistencies are minor and do not make a dent in his credibility.

He got angry at the accused because of Suief’s long story and thus started to falsely implicate him in his long statements to the CNB (“the False Incrimination Claim”).

After the embezzlement, the accused’s role was restricted to debt collection in Malaysia and he was no longer allowed to collect debts in Singapore. The two roles were different.

However, for the former, two employees would be assigned for the debt collection because the employees had to collect the moneys directly from the debtors and problems could arise.

</div> Even assuming that the accused only left the West Coast McDonald’s <span class="font-italic">after</span> Shanmugam left Singapore at 9.36 am, the accused would have approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, between 9.36 am and 12.19 pm) to travel to Ang Mo Kio to meet Kelvin, collect the debt moneys and head to the Woodlands Checkpoint. If I assume that the accused and Shanmugam left the West Coast McDonald’s at about the <span class="font-italic">same</span><span class="font-italic"> time</span> and that Shanmugam needed about 36 minutes to travel to the Woodland’s Checkpoint, both the accused and Shanmugam would have left the West Coast McDonald’s at about 9.00 am. If so, the accused would have approximately 3 hours and 19 minutes (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, between 9.00 am and 12.19 pm) to travel to Ang Mo Kio to meet Kelvin, collect the debt moneys and return to the Woodlands Checkpoint. After factoring in the possibility of adverse traffic conditions, the entire car journey should take no longer than 2 hours. Kelvin testified that he met the accused sometime from 10 am to 10.30 am on 12 October 2011 and that it would take him less than a minute to hand over the debt moneys to the accused.

</div> Assuming that Gobi was being truthful when he testified that the accused left him for 15 to 20 minutes to collect the moneys from Kelvin, the maximum time necessary for the whole journey from the West Coast McDonald’s to Ang Mo Kio for the debt collection (with 20 minutes allowance for the debt collection itself) and then to the Woodlands Checkpoint would be 2 hours and 20 minutes. This still leaves between 23 minutes of spare time (if the accused left the West Coast McDonald’s at 9.36 am) and 59 minutes of spare time (if the accused left the West Coast McDonald’s earlier at 9.00 am), thus making it possible for the accused to collect the debt moneys for the Moneylender <span class="font-italic">and </span>be at the West Coast McDonald’s on 12 October 2011 during the whole time that Shanmugam was there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For the accused to come all the way to Singapore just to make an introduction of one Courier to the other would likely be a complete waste of time, effort and petrol. When the accused came to Singapore on 12 October 2011 as part of his work assignment to collect debt monies from Kelvin, it would be very convenient to use that opportunity to introduce Shanmugam to Suief. This is what I believe had happened. The alibi of the Defence is not a good alibi because there was only co-incidence of the date, 12 October 2011, but no co-incidence of the time of the debt collection and the time of the introduction meeting to be able to establish that the accused could not have been present at the introduction meeting.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) My conclusion as to the events on 12 October 2011</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In light of the foregoing, I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused introduced Shanmugam to Suief at West Coast McDonald’s for the purpose of facilitating an impending drug transaction sometime after Deepavali. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The crux of the issue is this: if it is clear that Shanmugam and Suief (1) were not known to each other prior to the introduction meeting on 12 October 2011; (2) did not have any mutual acquaintances apart from the accused; and (3) eventually ended up working <span class="font-italic">together</span> as couriers trafficking in not less than 28.50 g of diamorphine on 28 October 2011 <span class="font-italic">after</span> having been <span class="font-italic">earlier</span> recruited <span class="font-italic">separately</span> as drug couriers by the accused, there must be a starting point to their very short 16-day relationship. Given the totality of the evidence before me, I am driven inexorably to the conclusion that it began with the accused’s introduction of Shanmugam to Suief at the West Coast McDonald’s on 12 October 2011 for the purpose of linking them up to form the courier chain for the accused, despite his repeated (but unsupported) protestations otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) A side note about the events of 12 October 2011</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As an aside, I note that there is some peculiarity in the events of 12 October 2011, which appear strange and inexplicable. Focusing first on Shanmugam’s evidence, it appears that the accused had a strong desire to avoid being in the Kenari car at the Checkpoint.

I thus find that Shanmugam brought ten bundles containing not less than 28.50g of diamorphine in the Kenari car into Singapore on the accused’s instructions. Further, the accused directed the Couriers to transport the bundles within Singapore and to deliver three of them to Ali Bell at Block 405 Pandan Gardens. I find on the totality of the evidence that the accused was the mastermind of this entire criminal endeavour. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 It is trite that a finding on credibility can be based on some or all of the following: (a) the witness’ demeanour; (b) the internal consistency in the content of his evidence; or (c) the external consistency between the content of his evidence and the extrinsic evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Farida</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([126] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9]). Drawing the various pieces of evidence together and after carefully evaluating the demeanour of the various witnesses, the internal consistency of their evidence and the external consistency of their evidence with the objective extrinsic evidence, my findings can be briefly summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Suief is a credible witness whose evidence suffices on its own to support the Prosecution’s case. On the whole, his evidence is both internally and externally consistent. He also testified in a forthright manner, to the extent of admitting that he had lied during the HC 2014 Trial. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Shanmugam was initially a credible witness despite his obvious unwillingness to testify. For reasons of his own, he turned completely hostile during his cross-examination and fabricated a number of ludicrous and outlandish claims in an attempt to neutralise the damning effect of his earlier evidence against the accused (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>during examination-in-chief). That being said, I have placed <span class="font-italic">some </span>weight on his evidence given during examination-in-chief and his statements when they are capable of being corroborated by other sources of evidence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Suief’s testimony, the ICA records and the Phone Records. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is sufficient consistency in the evidence of the Couriers as corroborated by objective documentary records to establish their version of events on 12, 27 and 28 October 2011. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Seen as a whole, the specific events show that the accused was the directing mind behind the Drug Transaction on 28 October 2011. His complicity is not restricted to giving instructions to the Couriers on 28 October 2011 and passing the drugs to Shanmugam although these would suffice to impute constructive liability on the accused. The accused leveraged on his individual association with Shanmugam and Suief to recruit them both as his couriers and even made a trip down to Singapore to introduce them to each other.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The accused’s bare assertion that he did not know the Couriers and thus was not associated with their trafficking activities is artificial and contrived. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Defence’s alternative explanation for the specific events do not suffice to raise a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I thus find that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt such that s 34 of the Penal Code operates to impute constructive liability on the accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Final denials: the Kenari car and Raja </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Out of an abundance of caution, I also will deal with the Defence’s final submission on the Kenari car and Shanmugam’s final attempt to exonerate the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The Defence submits that it was not possible for the accused to be complicit in the trafficking activities of the Couriers as he never had possession of the Kenari car and thus could not have passed possession of it, along with the Controlled Drugs, to Shanmugam on 27 October 2011. In support of this, the Defence sought to adduce two statements from the registered owner of the Kenari car, Tamilchelvy a/p Maripan (“Tamilchelvy”) and her brother, Vignesh Maripan (“Vignesh”) under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii) of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I allowed the application to adduce hearsay evidence. I was satisfied that both Tamilchelvy and Vignesh are Malaysian citizens habitually resident outside of Singapore. Mr Fernando expended considerable effort to secure their attendance, which included repeated phone calls and voice messages to their stated landline number and personally visiting their residence in Johor on 27 November 2019, but to no avail.

In return for the use of the car, “Raja” would pay the car instalments to Tamilchelvy’s finance company. The car would remain registered in Tamilchelvy’s name.

It was also not conclusively determined that the accused was not Towing Raja, “Raja” or a person who had obtained possession of the Kenari car from Tamilchelvy, the registered owner of the car.

</div> I reject these claims as there is no support for them whatsoever. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I end off with a final observation. Shanmugam’s persistent attempts not to implicate the accused can be rationalised by looking at the broader background. Shanmugam’s foster mother, Somunainar Thilagavathi (“Somunainar”) testified that after Shanmugam’s arrest, two mystery men approached her to ask her about Shanmugam. They asked where Shanmugam was and whether she is his mother. Somunainar relayed this incident to Shanmugam when she visited him in jail.
