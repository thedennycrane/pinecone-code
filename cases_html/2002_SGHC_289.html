<i xmlns=""><b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background facts</font>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The plaintiffs, Colombo Dockyard Limited, are a

large public corporation in Sri Lanka. They are, as their name suggests, in dockyard,

maritime and port-related activities. They are said to own 51% of a company incorporated

in Singapore known as Ceylon Shipping Agency.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The defendant, Athula Anthony Jayasinghe, is a

Sri Lankan national. He was at all material times the managing director of a Singapore

company known as Oriental Pearl Trading Pte Ltd (‘Orient Pearl’). The defendant

also carried on business in Singapore under the name of Metro Maritime Services.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        On or about 1 January 1995, the plaintiffs

appointed Orient Pearl to act as managing agents of Ceylon Shipping Agency and the

defendant as the managing director of Orient Pearl, took over the management of Ceylon

Shipping Agency.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        On or about 9 July 1997, a sum of US$650,000

was remitted by the plaintiffs to an account held by Metro Maritime Services with the

Overseas Union Bank of Singapore. The receipt of the payment of the said sum by the

defendant was never in dispute. The purpose of the remittance as averred in para 4 of the

plaintiffs’ statement of claim was that it was to be used to promote the

plaintiffs’ business and apply the said sum in accordance with instructions that were

to be given to him by the plaintiffs from time to time. The person who admittedly liaised

with the defendant and made arrangements on behalf of the plaintiffs in this connection

was one Sarath De Costa (‘De Costa’), a director of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        What followed next was somewhat mystifying. In

a nutshell, a tug-of-war developed between the plaintiffs and the defendant in relation to

the disposition of the sum paid. Consequently, the plaintiffs brought this action for the

recovery of a sum of US$649,187.50 (ie US$650,000 less bank charges of US$12.50) from the

defendant. The defendant for his part denied that the plaintiffs were entitled to any

repayment as he had disbursed the said sum according to instructions given to him by De

Costa in relation to a confidential assignment beneficial to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Evidence</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The plaintiffs’ principal witness in this

action was De Costa. His evidence insofar as is material can be stated in the following

terms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        He met the defendant through a mutual friend

who helped the defendant set up Orient Pearl. Ceylon Shipping Agency, one of the

plaintiffs’ subsidiaries, was a joint venture between the Ceylon Shipping Corporation

(a government company) and the plaintiffs. On or about 1 January 1995, the plaintiffs

appointed Orient Pearl to act as the managing agent of Ceylon Shipping Agency and the

defendant as managing director of Orient Pearl took over the management of Ceylon Shipping

Agency.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        Sometime in the first half of 1997, the

plaintiffs’ directors decided to remit a substantial sum of money to Singapore to be

used over a period of time in connection with the promotion of the plaintiffs’

business. The plaintiffs’ directors took the view at that time that it would be

useful to have some funds in Singapore for the purposes of their business.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        By this time, the defendant as managing

director of Orient Pearl had been managing Ceylon Shipping Agency for about two years and

the plaintiffs’ directors had come to trust him. De Costa suggested to them that the

defendant be asked to hold the monies on the plaintiffs’ behalf and apply the same in

accordance with instructions. He was then given the green light by the plaintiffs’

directors to approach the defendant to act as custodian of the plaintiffs’ funds and

to apply the same in accordance with instructions which would be relayed to him from time

to time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        Subsequently, De Costa met the defendant in Sri

Lanka and conveyed to him the plaintiffs’ wish. He asked the defendant whether he

would be agreeable to hold the monies to be remitted to him, on the plaintiffs’

behalf and to apply the same in accordance with instructions to be given to him from time

to time. The defendant agreed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        Consequently, on 9 July 1997, a sum of

US$650,000 was remitted by the plaintiffs to an account operated by the defendant in the

name of Metro Maritime Services with the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        De Costa expected the defendant to contact him

after the defendant had received the remittance but this did not happen. Two or three days

after the remittance, De Costa’s secretary informed him that the defendant was in Sri

Lanka. De Costa then called the defendant in Sri Lanka but to his shock and surprise, the

defendant not only pretended not to know him but also denied having received the said sum

or having agreed to act on the plaintiffs’ behalf or having anything to do with the

plaintiffs. Presently, De Costa enlisted the help of D.L.H. Ganlath (‘Ganlath’),

an attorney-at-law, as well as a director of the plaintiffs, to speak to the defendant

with a view to recovering the sum remitted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        He later learnt from Ganlath that the defendant

had admitted receiving the said sum but was asserting a right to offset it against fees

due to him for work he had done for De Costa. De Costa reported the developments to the

other directors of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        In or about October 1997, the directors of the

plaintiffs decided that a further effort be made to resolve the matter amicably with the

defendant. Subsequently, Sarath Obeysekera (‘Obeysekera’), the plaintiffs’

managing director, informed De Costa and his fellow directors that he had contacted the

defendant and the latter had agreed to attend a meeting scheduled to take place in October

1997 at the Hyatt Hotel, Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Following the arrangement, the plaintiffs’

then chairman, Ide, Obeysekera, Ganlath and De Costa arrived in Singapore for the meeting.

The defendant, however, failed to turn up for the meeting at the appointed time and date

and the result was that the plaintiffs’ effort to achieve an amicable resolution of

the matter failed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        In the event, by a letter dated 16 July 1998,

the plaintiffs requested the defendant to repay the said sum to them. The defendant failed

to comply with this request.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        De Costa learnt subsequently from Koichi

Yamanaka (Yamanaka) the new chairman of the plaintiffs, that the defendant had called him

in Sri Lanka on 28 July 1998 and requested a meeting with him to discuss the remittance.

Yamanaka’s reply to the defendant was that the plaintiffs’ board of directors

had already made a decision to take legal action against the defendant and as such he

should contact the plaintiffs’ legal officer to discuss the matter instead.

Subsequently, six pages of photocopied documents were left at Yamanaka’s residence in

Sri Lanka by the defendant. According to De Costa, the defendant had left the said

documents in an endeavour to explain what he had done with the monies remitted to him. The

documents however reflected some transactions in the year 1996, prior to the remittance of

the sum of US$650,000.00 and were unrelated to the sum in issue.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Since the defendant had failed to return the

monies remitted to him, the plaintiffs wrote to him on 19 August 1998, stating that the

documents which had been forwarded by the defendant did not provide any explanation as to

what he had done with the monies remitted to him. The plaintiffs demanded in that letter

that the defendant provide documents to show how he had utilised the said sum. No reply

was forthcoming. Through their solicitors’ letters dated 30 October and 7 November

1998, the plaintiffs again demanded the repayment by the defendant of the said sum. No

payment was received from the defendant and hence the commencement of the proceedings

herein on 8 December 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        De Costa also denied the allegations of the

defendant, contained in the particulars of the defence filed on 25 May 1999, that De Costa

had orally requested the defendant to render services to the plaintiffs and to carry out

such services in strict confidence. De Costa said that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of

any alleged concessions obtained, undertakings revalidated or environment created by the

defendant for the plaintiffs through the officers of the Sri Lankan Government.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        De Costa further averred that he had not

participated in any fraudulent scam involving the siphoning out monies of the plaintiffs

or any other wrongful acts. He asserted that the sum of US$650,000 was sent to the

defendant for business promotion purposes; neither the said sum nor any part thereof

comprised bribe money; and the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the making of any bribes by

the defendant. He added that he did not receive any part of the said sum of US$650,000 and

the allegation that he had received part of the sum of US$650,000 remitted to him were

false, mischievous and malicious.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        De Costa was cross-examined by counsel for the

defendant in relation to his previous dealings with the defendant. It would appear from

the answers given by De Costa in cross-examination that he had prior to 1997, an ongoing

business relationship with the defendant to the extent that there were a number of

payments made to him by the defendant – all of them pre-dating the remittance of the

sum by the plaintiffs in July 1997 (pages 192 to 198 of the NE and AB-2 to AB-8). De Costa

admitted receiving US$122,500, US$400,000 (AB-3/AB-4), US$30,000 (AB-6) and another sum of

US$200,000 (AB-7) paid to his wife. He explained that the last payment of US$200,000 was

chanelled through his wife to a person in Japan in connection with the plaintiffs’

business promotional efforts (pages 196 and 197 of the NE). There were two other payments

of US$28,000 and US$45,000. De Costa denied receiving these two sums.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        De Costa explained why the plaintiffs had set

up a business promotion fund in Singapore. He said it was to pay ship’s crew such as

superintendents, captains and the like to give them incentives to bring work to the

plaintiffs’ yards (see pages 190 to 192 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        De Costa was recalled after the defence

witnesses had completed their testimonies, particularly in relation to his alleged

handwriting in certain documents as well as to clarify the two payments of US$28,000 and

US$45,000 reportedly received by his accountant. De Costa denied receipt of the said two

sums. His replies were somewhat ambivalent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        Yamanaka, the present chairman of the

plaintiffs, in his testimony confirmed that after his appointment as chairman on 22 April

1998, he was briefed about the remittance made to the defendant and the failure to recover

the said sum from the defendant. He said that he met the defendant sometime in June or

July 1998 at the residence of Obeysekera, a fellow director. At that meeting, Yamanaka

asked the defendant whether the defendant had kept the funds for himself. The defendant

presently showed him six pages of documents which looked like ‘bank advices’.

When he asked the defendant whether he could make copies of the said six pages, the

defendant refused. When he asked the defendant what had happened to the monies, the

defendant, after admitting that he had received the remittance, merely showed him the six

pages once again.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        According to Yamanaka, he received a telephone

call from the defendant on 28 July 1998. The defendant told him that he wanted a further

meeting to discuss the remittance. Yamanaka told the defendant this time that the

plaintiffs had already decided to take legal action against the defendant and if there was

any explanation, it should be provided to the plaintiffs’ legal officer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        Subsequently, Yamanaka received six pages of

documents, presumably sent by the defendant. On examination, he found the documents were

all dated 1996, pre-dating the remittance in 1997 and they did not seem to provide any

explanation as to the disposition of the sum sent to the defendant by the plaintiffs in

July 1997. Consequently, legal proceedings were instituted against the defendant on 8

December 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        Obeysekera, the managing director of the

plaintiffs, in his evidence said that sometime in the first half of 1997, the

plaintiffs’ directors decided to remit a substantial sum of money to Singapore to be

used in connection with the plaintiffs’ business. The plaintiffs’ directors

formed the view that having a fund in Singapore would be convenient for the plaintiffs and

would enable the plaintiffs to respond to business needs more quickly. De Costa proposed

that the sum be remitted to the defendant, on the basis that the defendant would hold the

sum as custodian and apply it in accordance with instructions which would be relayed to

him from time to time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        Since the plaintiffs had previous dealings with

the defendant the plaintiffs’ directors had come to trust the defendant and agreed to

the remittance of funds to Singapore to be held by the defendant as custodian. De Costa

was asked to go ahead and approach the defendant to make the necessary arrangements for

such a remittance. De Costa subsequently reported that the defendant had agreed to hold

the monies on the plaintiffs’ behalf and apply the monies in accordance with

instructions to be given to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        Consequently, a sum of US$650,000 was remitted

to the defendant in Singapore in early July 1997. De Costa, subsequently reported to the

chairman and board of directors of the plaintiffs that when he had called the defendant to

confirm the remittance, the defendant pretended not to know De Costa and denied all

knowledge of the remittance. De Costa further informed them that he had requested Ganlath

(a director of the plaintiffs who also acts as Sarath De Costa’s attorney) to speak

to the defendant and obtain the refund of the monies remitted. However, Ganlath’s

endeavours were in vain.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30

        Obeysekera averred that neither the said sum

nor any part thereof comprised bribe money. He reiterated that he did not receive any part

of the said sum of US$650,000 and the allegations in the particulars filed by the

defendant that Obeysekera had received part of the said sum of US$650,000.00 were false,

defamatory and mischievous. He added that he had no knowledge of any services rendered by

the defendant justifying payment to the defendant of US$650,000 or any other amount

thereof. The rest of his evidence was no different from that of De Costa and Yamanaka and

requires no repetition here.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31

        Insofar as is material, the evidence of Ganlath

is as follows. He met the defendant upon instructions from the plaintiffs. The defendant

told him that he had offset the monies he had received (ie US$650,000) against what was

due to him for services rendered to De Costa. Ganlath asked the defendant to provide him

with an account of how the defendant had dealt with the monies remitted and a detailed

statement of the services rendered to De Costa so that he could take instructions from the

plaintiffs. Although the defendant promised Ganlath that he would give a detailed account

of the said monies, none was forthcoming. Later, Ranjith Silva, an attorney-at-law and the

brother-in-law of the defendant informed Ganlath that the defendant would not be giving an

account of the said monies. Ganlath further confirmed that he travelled to Singapore

together with Ide, the former chairman of the plaintiffs, De Costa and Obeysekera in or

about October 1997 to meet the defendant by prior appointment at the Hyatt Hotel but the

defendant failed to turn up for the said meeting.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        Miss Tan Lee Noi, Assistant Manager of Overseas

Union Bank, where the defendant operated an account, was called to give evidence in

relation to Metro Maritime’s account No. 3430-33175-201. She detailed the movement of

monies in the said account.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        There was one other witness, Chandrasiri

Kotigale (‘Kotigale’), the deputy general manager of the legal department in

Seylan Bank Limited, who was called by the plaintiffs to rebut certain aspects of the

evidence of the defendant. His evidence and the subsequent developments in relation

thereto will be dealt with later in this grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        Before recapitulating the evidence proffered by

the defendant and his witness, it would be helpful to make reference to the

defendant’s pleadings. The defence filed originally on 31 December 1998 was skimpy.

The averments of the defendant in paras 2 and 3 of his original defence were only these:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. Save that the sum of

    US$650,000.00 was remitted to the Defendant on 9.7.97 by Mr Sarath de Costa who was acting

    for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim is denied.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3. The Defendant avers that the

    said Mr Sarath de Costa, acting for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, had obtained the

    services of the Defendant for a specific purpose directly beneficial to the Plaintiffs and

    the said purpose was mutually agreed to be strictly confidential. Upon provision of the

    said services and fulfilment of the said specific purpose by the Defendant, Mr Sarath de

    Costa acting for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, remitted the said sum of US$650,000.00

    to the Defendant for payment of the same.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        The amended defence filed on 29 April 1999 was

expansive. Paragraphs 5 to 9 of the amended defence read as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5. The Defendant avers that in

    early 1994, the Plaintiffs, who were then wholly owned by the Sri Lankan government, went

    through a re-structuring of shareholding and Onamichi Dockyard (Pte) Ltd became

    substantial shareholders in accordance with the government policy to privatise government

    owned enterprises. The Plaintiffs were privatised amidst massive protests from

    shareholders, workers, officials and trade unionists and attempts by interested parties to

    oust the new management. Subsequently, the Plaintiffs faced intense opposition from the

    government bodies as a result of inter alia the Plaintiffs’ losses on investments. It

    was under the aforesaid circumstances that the Defendant was requested by the said Mr

    Sarath de Costa some time in March 1997 to render the said services.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6. The Defendant duly provided

    the said services in that he obtained concessions, re-validated default undertakings and

    created an environment for the Plaintiffs to conduct their affairs with the trust and

    goodwill of the government as well as enabled the Plaintiffs to participate in further

    government projects. The Defendant avers that part of the said sum of US$650,000.00

    consisted of bribe money and that the Plaintiffs had exploited the said services pursuant

    to a fraudulent scam to siphon money out of the Plaintiffs which was unknown to the

    Defendant at the material time. Full details of the said services and how the said sum of

    US$650,000.00 was expended will be disclosed at the trial of this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7. Upon provision of the said

    services and fulfilment of the said specific purpose by the Defendant, Mr Sarath de Costa

    acting for and on behalf of the Plaintiffs, remitted the said sum of US$650,000.00 to the

    Defendant for payment of the same. It is therefore denied that the said sum was remitted

    to the Defendant for the purpose of promoting the Plaintiffs’ business.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8. The firm Metro Maritime

    Services was set up by the Defendant in Singapore on 21.6.97 at the request of the said Mr

    Sarath de Costa as the said Mr Sarath de Costa had feared a risk of a leak of information

    and a risk that the Defendant’s identity be exposed if the said sum was remitted to

    the Defendant’s personal account. Hence, Metro Maritime was set up for the sole

    purpose of receiving the remittance of the said sum.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.6

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Defence evidence</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        The evidence of the defendant, insofar as is

material is as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        He is the director of Orient Pearl which was

set up in Singapore on 1 August 1992. On 1 January 1995, the plaintiffs appointed Orient

Pearl to act as managing agents for Ceylon Shipping Agency, a subsidiary of the

plaintiffs. In this connection, on or about May 1995, one Ananda Vitharana

(‘Vitharana’) was assigned by Orient Pearl to manage Ceylon Shipping Agency. On

1 July 1998, Vitharana became the manager of Ceylon Shipping Agency. Metro Maritime

Services was registered as a sole-proprietorship on 21 June 1997. The defendant is its

sole proprietor. Metro Maritime Services was in fact registered at the request of the

plaintiffs’ vice-chairman, De Costa.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        The plaintiffs who were previously wholly-owned

by the Sri Lankan government went through a restructuring of its shareholding following

the Sri Lanka government’s effort to privatise state-owned entities. Consequently, a

Japanese corporation known as Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd (‘Onomichi’) became the

managing shareholders of the plaintiffs in or about March 1993.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        According to the defendant, there was in

existence an agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and Onomichi, whereby upon the

latter becoming the major shareholders of the plaintiffs, Onomichi was to provide an

interest-free loan of Sri Lankan Rupees 100 million as foreign investment. Onomichi also

agreed to send 50 local workers to Japan for training at Onomichi’s expense. However,

there were problems and defaults by Onomichi in relation to their obligations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        Further, when the plaintiffs became private in

early 1993, they were facing massive protests from shareholders, workers, government

officials and trade unions. To add to the problems, there were also attempts by interested

parties to oust the new management of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43

        Under the circumstances, sometime in March

1997, the defendant was requested by De Costa, acting on behalf of the plaintiffs to

render his services for the benefit of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        He added that De Costa provided him with the

requisite information relating to the plaintiffs which enabled him to render the said

services to the plaintiffs. As there were certain problems in connection with the sale of

the shares of the plaintiffs to the said Onomichi, it was his allotted task to iron out

the said problems by establishing contacts with certain government personalities. In this

regard, he liaised with a group of very important people to obtain concessions,

re-validate default undertakings, rectify the errors committed by the plaintiffs and

create an environment for the plaintiffs to conduct their affairs with the trust and

goodwill of the government. This was to enable the plaintiffs to participate in further

government projects. The identity and information on the said group of very important

people were furnished to him by De Costa.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45

        He added that the terms of his assignment were

on the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1) The Assignment was of a

    confidential nature and he was bound to maintain strict confidentiality of the Assignment

    and the parties involved;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2) A sum of US$650,000.00 would

    be remitted to him by the plaintiffs and of the said US$650,000.00, he would be paid 5% of

    the said sum amounting to about US$32,500.00 for his services.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3) Of the balance sum of

    US$617,500.00, about US$367,500.00 was to be given to important government officials and

    other staff of government departments as bribes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4) Sarath De Costa was to take a

    portion of the said US$617,500.00 amounting to US$250,000.00. Sarath De Costa informed him

    that the said US$250,000.00 would be used to pay the relevant officials and parties which

    would involve the settling of certain issues with the Sri Lanka Port Authority;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5) The said US$650,000.00 was to

    be remitted to his personal bank account; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6) It was agreed that

    US$200,000.00, being part payment of US$650,000.00 was to be remitted to him when the

    clearing of certain immediate issues had progressed to a certain point.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46

        He said that De Costa dealt with him on behalf

of the plaintiffs at all times. The nature of the assignment was also fully known to Ide,

the former chairman of the plaintiffs, Obeysekera and to Gilbert, the finance manager of

the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        He said that he had pledged utmost confidence

and secrecy with whom he had dealt in relation to the plaintiffs’ assignment. He

claimed that to disclose the identities of the persons to whom he had disbursed the sums

of money, would expose him to serious risks including his life.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48

        However, much later when under

cross-examination he disclosed the names of three persons: M N Junaid the Secretary, Sri

Lanka Ministry of Port &amp; Shipping, M M Rafeek, Vice-Chairman, Sri Lanka Port Authority

and H Wijeeoonuwardena, the managing director of Sri Lanka Port Authority (page 560 of the

NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49

       He said by early May 1997, the immediate issues had

reached a certain point. However, an advance payment of US$200,000 promised, was not

remitted to him despite several reminders. All the same, the assignment given to him was

completed successfully to the satisfaction of the plaintiffs sometime in late June 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50

        He averred that it was at this stage that De

Costa raised the spectre of the seriousness of the leak of information. De Costa felt that

if US$650,000.00 was remitted to the defendant’s personal account, it might reveal

the defendant’s involvement and identity to the senior officials, general management

of the plaintiffs and eventually the shareholders of the plaintiffs and the government

authorities. De Costa proposed that the defendant set up a firm in Singapore with a

maritime name and to open a bank account for the firm so that US$650,000.00 could be

remitted to the said account.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51

        To expedite the said remittance, the defendant

agreed to set up a firm in Singapore by the name Metro Maritime Services. The name was in

fact selected by De Costa. Hence, Metro Maritime Services was set up on 21 June 1997 for

the sole purpose of receiving US$650,000.00 from the plaintiffs so that the

defendant’s identity and involvement in the assignment would be kept confidential.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52

        Upon the successful completion of the

assignment, the plaintiffs remitted the said US$650,000.00 to the account of Metro

Maritime Services by way of telegraphic transfer on 9 July 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53

        The important officials and the staff of

government departments who were to receive the bribe monies were made up of three

different groups. The said officials concerned had informed both De Costa and the

defendant of their decision to collect the bribe monies through their agents from a

trusted individual to be nominated by Sarath De Costa and the defendant. The said

officials concerned conveyed to De Costa and him over the telephone, the names and the

national identity numbers of three persons. It was for this reason that De Costa and the

defendant decided to appoint their mutual friend Kaluhath Upali Rajapakse

(‘Rajapakse’) to hand over the bribe monies to the said three nominated persons.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54

        He added that in July 1997, he gave a sum of Rs

21,315,000 (which was equivalent to about US$367,500 at the material time) in cash to

Rajapakse at Rajapakse’s residence in the presence of De Costa. Both he and De Costa

provided Rajapakse with the identity numbers of the said three persons who were to receive

the bribe monies from Rajapakse. Subsequently, De Costa and he informed the said officials

concerned, that the bribe monies were ready for collection from Rajapakse.

Rajapakse’s telephone number was also given to them. On the following day, Rajapakse

and the said officials concerned confirmed that the monies had been handed over.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55

        The defendant further averred that he had also

paid certain sums to De Costa as well as Obeysekera. He said that he gave De Costa

US$150,000 (approximately Rs 8,700,000) in cash, being part payment of the said

US$250,000.00. Subsequently, on or about 11 July 1997, De Costa attempted to implicate the

defendant in a fraudulent scam by requesting the defendant to sign a bogus consultancy

agreement between the plaintiffs and Metro Maritime Services and a draft letter requesting

US$650,000.00 from the plaintiffs. He refused to sign the said documents. He was shocked

that De Costa had attempted to involve him in the said scam. He, therefore, terminated his

relationship with Sarath De Costa. He denied that the said US$650,000 was remitted to him

to promote the plaintiffs’ business or to apply the said sum in accordance with the

plaintiffs’ instructions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56

        About a year later, on 16 July 1998, the

plaintiffs wrote to Metro Maritime Services, alleging that US$650,000 had been entrusted

to him for a specific purpose and requested the return of the said sum on the ground it

had not been utilized. He was shocked by the erroneous contents of the letter since the

said sum was remitted to him after the successful completion of the assignment given to

him, as agreed, and not otherwise.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57

        He confirmed that he had sent Yamanaka six

pages of documents, all dated before the remittance by the plaintiffs to him of the said

sum of US$650,000, to prove that he had extensive prior relationship with De Costa. This,

he did in order to provide an explanation to the query raised by the plaintiffs in their

letter dated 19 August 1998.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">58

        In this regard, the exchange of letters between

the plaintiffs and the defendant require reproduction. In their letter dated 16 July 1998,

the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant as follows:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">61

        The defendant maintained that he had been

acquainted with De Costa from about 1978. He then proceeded to sketch out the business

transactions he and De Costa were involved in, the various payments he made to De Costa

and the sums he received in relation to the transactions. In sum, he denied that he was

liable to the plaintiffs for the return of the said sum of US$650,000 or any sum at all.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">62

        The defendant was recalled for further

cross-examination. They are too long to be entered upon here. Suffice it, if I referred to

only a few significant aspects.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">63

        The defendant could not produce the notebook in

which he had entered the residential and handphone numbers of the three important

officials to whom he had paid the bribes. He said that he could not locate it (page 1199,

lines 4 to 9 of the NE). He was also unable to produce copies of the five cheques referred

to in his bank statements (exh P-9, page 1199 of the NE). When asked whether he would give

his consent to the plaintiffs to obtain information from his bank on the cheques which

featured in the present case, his reply was that he had to seek legal advice on this

matter. The other aspects of his evidence as to bank accounts and transfers will be

referred to later in these grounds, if found necessary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">64

        The next witness for the defence was Nissanka

Gerrard Ranjith Maxwell De Silva, an attorney-at-law from Sri Lanka and the brother-in-law

of the defendant. In his evidence-in-chief, he said that sometime in late July 1997,

Ganlath who is an attorney, a director of the plaintiffs as well as the legal consultant

and company secretary to De Costa’s group of private companies, called him up and

arranged to meet him and the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">65

        Following the said arrangement, sometime in

late July or early August 1997, they met at the defendant’s office at Colombo. At

that meeting, Ganlath requested the defendant to sign a consultancy agreement purportedly

between the plaintiffs and the defendant’s Metro Maritime Services.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">66

        Being forewarned by the defendant of an attempt

by De Costa to implicate the defendant in a fraudulent scheme, he advised the defendant

not to sign the agreement. He told Ganlath that the proposed consultancy agreement was a

fraudulent device and that Metro Maritime Services did not possess the requisite expertise

or skills relating to construction of navy petrol boats as set out in the said consultancy

agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">67

        In late 1997, he accompanied the defendant to

meet Obeysekera at the latter’s residence at Colombo. Obeysekera also requested the

defendant to sign the said consultancy agreement. Once again, he advised the defendant not

to sign the agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">68

        Sadly, De Silva fell ill at the very outset of

his cross-examination. He was rushed to hospital by ambulance. The court was told the

following day that he suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away as a result.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">69

        The evidence-in-chief of Rajapakse was to the

following effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">70

        He has been a friend of De Costa and the

defendant. In late July 1997, De Costa and the defendant requested his assistance to hand

over Rs 21,315,000 in cash to three persons who would call on him to collect Rs 11,600,000

(US$200,000 approximately), Rs 7,250,000 (US$125,000 approximately) and Rs 2,465,000

(US$42,500 approximately) respectively. De Costa and the defendant told him that the said

payments were for some important people who had assisted them. Both of them told him that

they were bribe monies and the matter was strictly confidential.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">71

        Subsequently, sometime in late July 1997, De

Costa and the defendant came over to his house and handed to him a sum of Rs21,315,000 in

cash. They then provided him with the names and national identity numbers of the three

persons who would be collecting the monies from him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">72

        The following day, he handed over the said Rs

21,315,000 in three parcels to three persons, Ruparatne, Fernando and Gamage after

verifying their identities. He did not, however, receive any receipt for the said sums

from them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">73

        When cross-examined, he said that De Costa and

the defendant spoke to him first on 21 July 1977 in relation to this transaction (page 897

of the NE). When asked whether either De Costa or the defendant mentioned to him the

amount of Rs 21,315,000 on that day, he replied: ‘… both of them only told me

that an amount about 21 million has to be handed over’ (page 907, lines 1 to 2 of the

NE). However, when his attention was invited to what he had said in para 2 of his

affidavit where he had mentioned the figure 21,315,000, he said he was told the specific

amount of Rs 21,315,000 (page 907, lines 10 to 12 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74

        When he was further cross-examined as to

whether either De Costa or the defendant mentioned the three separate figures of Rs

11,600,000, Rs 7,250,000 and Rs 2,465,000 on 21 July 1997 to him, he replied that these

breakdowns were not given to him (page 908, lines 1 to 5 of the NE). Later, he changed his

evidence and claimed that he was told of the specific amounts (page 908, lines 20 to 24

and page 909, lines 1 to 18 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">75

        On being questioned when De Costa and the

defendant visited him in his house, he said it was on 22 July 1997. As to why he did not

mention the relevant dates in his affidavit, he said at the time when he was affirming the

affidavit he was not sure of the dates. He had them noted in his diary, and hence his

recall at present (page 912 of the NE). In relation to his earlier claim that De Costa and

the defendant told him of the names and national identity numbers of the prospective three

recipients of the monies, he said that the names and identity numbers were mentioned only

by De Costa and not by the defendant (pages 918 and 919 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">76

        The next witness called by the defendant was

Telge Tyrone Damien Peiris (‘Peiris’) the former chairman of the plaintiffs from

August 1999 to May 1994. Insofar as is material, his evidence related to matters

concerning the plaintiffs in the years he was the chief executive officer of the

plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">77

        He said that there was a collaboration

agreement between the Sri Lankan Government and Onomichi in the years 1993 and 1994. He

said that under the agreement, Onomichi was obliged to bring in to the plaintiffs Rs 100

million in the form of an interest-free loan as foreign investment and that Onomichi was

also required to send 50 workers of the plaintiffs to Japan for training at the expense of

Onomichi. He mentioned that following defaults by Onomichi on these agreements, there had

been massive protests from shareholders, workers, officials and trade unionists. From 1993

to 1994, there were attempts by interested parties to oust the new management of the

plaintiffs. He added: ‘I am aware that the aforesaid matters continued after 1994 and

they still exist todate.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">78

        The next significant witness for the defence

was: Condagamage Punsiri Saman Fernando (‘Fernando’). His evidence is as

follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">79

        He is a friend of the defendant. He has had

previous dealings in currency with the defendant. Sometime in July 1997, there was a

telephone call for him from Singapore from the defendant. The defendant asked him whether

Fernando would be able to advance him Sri Lankan currency to the equivalent of US$425,000.

The defendant said that he would need the money sometime in late July 1997 and he had with

him US$425,000. Fernando agreed and asked the defendant to place the sum of US$425,000 in

two fixed deposit accounts in De Costa’s favour in the sums of US$100,000 and

US$325,000 respectively for a term (see 1010 of NE). Sometime in late July 1997, the

defendant accompanied by De Costa, called at his residence and collected a suitcase

containing Sri Lankan rupees 24,000,000 plus. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">80

        Sometime in early July 1998, Fernando

instructed the defendant to remit to De Costa’s non-resident foreign currency account

US$100,000, in order to repay Fernando a sum of Rs 6,325,000. The defendant complied with

the request.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">81

        He claimed that he had known the defendant well

and trusted him. Later, he also asked the defendant to obtain for him a bank guarantee

from the ABN Amro Bank in Singapore, against the security of the deposit of US$325,000.

The defendant duly obtained the guarantee requested on 26 May 1999 in favour of a company

known as Vajira House Builders in Colombo, which was owned by Fernando. He added he had

since received full settlement of the sums he had advanced to the defendant, equivalent to

US$425,000, including all interests earned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">82

        When cross-examined, Fernando claimed that the

defendant first spoke to him about him making available to the defendant a large sum of

money in Colombo sometime at the end of April or early May 1997 (page 1020 of the NE,

lines 1 to 6). He later said that his intention was to advance a sum of about Rs 24 to 25

million Rupees to the defendant not as a loan but as an investment (page 1028, lines 4 to

7).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">83

        His evidence as respects how the sum of 24

million rupees was packed, counted and handed over to the defendant appears from pages

1037 to 1045. He said that the notes were in denominations of 1,000 Rupees and were placed

in a suitcase. They were all stacked in bundles. The defendant and De Costa counted them

while they were in his house for about 35 minutes in the evening of 22 July 1997 (page

1045 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">84

        When questioned as to whether he had asked the

defendant to sign any document confirming that the sums of US$325,000 and US$100,000 in

the fixed deposits were in fact his (ie Fernando’s), he replied in the negative. He

said that the defendant was his friend and therefore he did not think he was taking a

risk. He was of the view that even if the defendant were to die, the defendant’s wife

would have repaid the monies to him (page 1054 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">85

        The last witness for the defence was Sunil

Rohan Abeywickrema. His evidence was as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">86

        He is a director of a travel agency in Sri

Lanka. He had known both the defendant and De Costa well. He had handled their travel

matters previously. On 14 July 1997, the defendant who was then in Singapore called him in

Colombo. He told him that he wanted to remit to him a sum of US$50,000 and in return he

wanted its equivalent sum in Sri Lankan Rupees when the defendant returned to Colombo.

Consequently, he received a sum of US$50,000 in the later part of July 1997 in his foreign

currency account for which he gave the defendant Sri Lankan Rs 2.9 million. This sum was

handed to the defendant in Colombo.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">87

        It now remains for me to deal with two further

witnesses called by the plaintiffs with leave of court, with a view to rebutting certain

aspects of the defendant’s claim in relation to two bank accounts operated in his

name with the Seylan Bank, Colombo, ie: (a) Account No. 5807960 – Sri Lankan Rupees

Account (‘Rupee Account’) and (b) Account No. 5932295 – US Dollar

non-resident foreign currency account (‘USD Account’), both operated by the

defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">88

        Chandrasiri Kotigalage (‘Kotigale’)

Deputy General Manager of the Legal Department of Seylan Bank, testified as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">89

        He confirmed that the Rupee Account and USD

Account were maintained at the Boralesgamua branch of the Seylan Bank. He then compared

exh P-9, a set of copies of Seylan Bank statements supplied to the plaintiffs by the

defendant’s solicitors during the trial (page 664, lines 1 to 6 and page 668, lines 1

to 2) with the bank’s own records. According to him, pages 1, 3 and 4 of exh P-9

which seemed to indicate movement of monies in the month of July 1997, did not take place.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">90

        He said that the Rupee Account according to the

bank records was in the name of the defendant and his wife and not in the defendant’s

sole name as indicated at pages 3 and 4 of the statements (exh P-9). According to him, the

Rupee Account was opened only on 9 October 1997. The first deposit in this account was

made on the same day by a cheque for Rupees 77,000. However, page 3 of exh P-9 purported

to show transactions for the period 1 July 1997. He then produced a copy of the statement

from the bank which entirely contradicted page 3 of exh P-9. According to him, the

transactions listed at page 3 of exh P-9 did not take place. He also disputed the veracity

of page 4 of the said exhibit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">91

        Similar comments were made by him in relation

to the USD Account. In this connection, comparing pages 1 and 2 of exh P-9 with the

bank’s records, he said that entries in the said exhibit do not correspond with the

entries in the bank records.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">92

        He also pointed out the discrepancy in the

address of the bank as appearing in the defendant’s alleged bank statements (exh

P-9). In sum, the testimony of this witness was that the copies of bank statements

produced by the defendant were false and exh P-9 did not truly reflect the state of both

the accounts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">93

        Kotigale was required for further

cross-examination. However on the next occasion he was to be made available, the defendant

could not be present due to his business commitments. Subsequently, for some reason

Kotigale could not again come to Singapore and as a result, the plaintiffs produced

another bank officer, James Joy Rajakumar Joseph (‘Joseph’) Deputy General

Manager of Restructuring and Recoveries Department of Seylan Bank. His evidence was

objected to by the defence. After hearing arguments, I admitted his evidence since the

bank’s witnesses were here to give evidence from documents and had little interest in

the outcome of the proceedings. Suffice it if I said that Joseph’s evidence was not

dissimilar to that of Kotigale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">94

        Before I deal with the closing speeches by

respective counsel, I must observe that at the last minute, sometime in July 2002, the

defendant wanted to call one further witness, Vitharana, an employee of Ceylon Shipping

Agency. The court was told that Vitharana would be able to narrate to the court that he

received instructions some time in May 1997 to remit a sum of US$200,000 to the wife of De

Costa. It was also alleged by the defence that it was Obeysekera who prevented Vitharana

from giving evidence for the defendant earlier. The plaintiffs’ counsel objected to

the proposed evidence stating that Obeysekera was presently overseas and not available to

contradict the fresh allegations by Vitharana. Since I formed the view that the proposed

evidence by Vitharana appeared to be peripheral to the issue at hand and at any rate, his

evidence as respects payment to the wife of De Costa pre-dated the transaction at hand, I

disallowed the application to call further witnesses at this very late stage.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Issues, arguments and conclusion</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">95

        There were lengthy and involved submissions by

both counsel on behalf of their respective clients. Their arguments spanned a vast

spectrum of evidence adduced at this trial, substantially in relation to the credibility

of witnesses and what weight and value the court should attach to such evidence. Stripped

of excess and overlap, there are in the main two issues which fall for determination. The

first is whether the defendant did disburse the monies sent to him in accordance with the

terms of his alleged assignment. Second, even if the court were to disbelieve the

defendant as to his several averments, that he paid out the said sum as bribes to various

Sri Lankan public servants and shared the remainder with De Costa, Obeysekera and himself,

is the remittance by the plaintiffs irrecoverable on grounds that the purpose of the

remittance is tainted by illegality?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">96

        In relation to the first issue, it should be

mentioned at the outset that there is no denial that the said sum of US$650,000 less the

bank charges of US$812.50 was indeed received by the defendant. The question then moves to

the next plane whether the defendant indeed paid out those sums as being alleged by him.

In other words is his story credible?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">97

        In evaluating the evidence in this regard, I

first considered the declared stand of the defendant prior to the commencement of the

proceedings. What he said in his letter dated 24 September 1998 to the legal manager and

company secretary of the plaintiffs was significant. He said: ‘… <i>we did not

have any agreements or dealings at any time with your organisation</i> … <i>The

aforesaid remittance is solely our dues for the disbursements and services rendered to Mr

Sarath De Costa</i>.’</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">98

        If what the defendant is contending at present

that he greased the palms of various Sri Lankan public officials on behalf of and for the

benefit of the plaintiffs and shared the balance with De Costa and Obeysekera, the

foregoing explanation, in my view, is totally out of character.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">99

        Now as to the details to whom the monies were

disbursed and in what proportion they were distributed, here again his original defence

filed on 31 December 1998 was curiously silent. In para 3 of his original defence, he

merely averred that De Costa, acting on behalf of the plaintiffs had obtained the services

of the defendant for a specific purpose directly beneficial to the plaintiffs; the said

purpose was mutually agreed to be confidential and upon provision of the said services, De

Costa acting on behalf of the plaintiffs, remitted the said sum of US$650,000 to him.

Strangely, there were no details in the original defence as to how and to whom the said

sum was paid out, despite the fact that the defendant had the services of competent and

able counsel both from Sri Lanka and Singapore at the time the original defence was filed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">100

        It was not until 29 April 1999, the defendant

came out with an explanation that he had rendered services to the plaintiffs in connection

with problems they were allegedly facing from government officials, trade unions, the

public and the shareholders. The allegation that De Costa and Obeysekara received a

substantial portion of the money also did not surface until the defendant provided

particulars on 25 May 1999. And further, the names of the three government officials

Junaid, Rafeek and Wijeoonuwardena, were not mentioned until his cross-examination.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">101

        In my evaluation, a person who had carried out

such a sensitive and important assignment to the satisfaction of his principals, would

have immediately come up with a scathing response the minute his alleged handler had

become a betrayer and an accuser. In my view, the defendant’s story is simply beyond

belief.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">102

        Now about the cash advance from Fernando.

According to the defendant as well as Fernando, cash totalling 24 million rupees was

advanced to the defendant without so much as even a slip of paper acknowledging the

receipt of such a sum. What more, even the deposit of the notional collateral of

US$425,000 was kept not in the name of Fernando but in the name of the defendant, that

also, curiously divided into two segments of US$325,000 and US$100,000 respectively. In my

view, it is extremely unlikely a person of Fernando’s ilk would have taken the risk

of lending such a large sum to a business associate without proper documentation, let

alone security.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">103

        Rajapakse claimed that a huge sum of Sri Lankan

rupees totalling 21,315,000 was carted into his house by De Costa and Fernando one

evening, and the next day he handed the monies to three persons also without obtaining any

acknowledgement from them. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he mentioned that it was

sometime in late July 1997, De Costa and the defendant came over to his house to hand over

the cash. However, suddenly during cross-examination he was able to specify the date of

delivery as being 22 July 1997. In my evaluation, Rajapakse’s evidence was least

persuasive, both in terms of his recall of dates as well as narration of events.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">104

        Returning to the evidence of the defendant,

there was a host of aspects in his testimony which tended to devalue rather than add

lustre to his credibility. First of all, his claim that he had successfully completed the

assignment given to him and solved the problems the plaintiffs were facing with government

officials, trade unions and others was negated by the evidence of Peiris, the former

chairman of the plaintiffs called by the defendant to give evidence on his behalf. Peiris

averred that the problems the plaintiffs were facing continued after 1994 and even until

the date of his testimony (page 980 – lines 17 to 18 of the NE).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">105

        Next, the defendant claimed in his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief that he had pledged utmost confidence and secrecy with whom he had dealt

in relation to the plaintiffs’ assignment. He claimed that Obeysekera, Ide as well as

Gilbert were fully knowledgeable of the secret assignment. If this was indeed the case,

there was no earthly reason why he should feel coy about placing these facts in his

earlier replies as well as in the defence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">106

        Next, when he was cross-examined, he revealed

for the first time the names of three officials he had allegedly bribed on behalf of the

plaintiffs. He claimed that he had their names and handphone numbers in a note book kept

by him. He promised to produce it to the court at the resumed hearing. But when he was

recalled, he could only say that the book had been misplaced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">107

        He was also significantly unable to produce

copies of five cheques referred to in in his purported bank statements (exh P-9), some of

which were alleged cash payments to De Costa. When challenged whether he would grant

permission to the plaintiffs to get the relevant particulars from his bankers, he baulked

saying that he had to seek legal advice although such advice was at hand all the time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">108

        What almost conclusively destroyed his

credibility were his Seylan bank statements. The evidence of both Kotgalge and Joseph, two

neutral witnesses from the Seylan Bank, was that exh P-9 containing four pages of Seylan

Bank’s alleged statements produced to the court by the defendant were false and that

they did not reflect the actual bank transactions. Although a brave attempt was made by

defendant’s counsel to diminish the value of these witnesses’ testimony, the

inference that exh P-9 was a concoction was inescapable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">109

        Now let me deal with De Costa’s evidence.

I must hasten to add that his evidence was also remarkable for its absence of candour. His

initial attempt to portray himself as a squeaky clean executive of the plaintiffs was

dashed by the revelation of his past dealings with the defendant and several inexplicable

monetary transactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">110

        Omission by De Costa to mention his past close

connections with the defendant as well as his slippery answers concerning the payments of

US$28,000 and US$45,000 apparently received by his accountant Mendis, in fact cast doubt

on his claim to purity and innocence. However, whether his less than proper conduct

infected the current claim of the plaintiffs against the defendant would be dealt with

later in these grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">111

        As to the evidence of Yamanaka, I accepted his

evidence that the defendant did not offer or attempt to offer him any plausible

explanation as to the disposition of the remittance of US$650,000 and I agree that the

defendants’ forwarding of six pages of documents detailing his past transactions with

De Costa had little to do with the claim at hand.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">112

        Then there is this puzzle concerning an alleged

consultancy agreement (DB-151 to 155) allegedly forwarded to the defendant for his

signature. It would appear that the intended parties to this so-called consultancy

agreement would be the plaintiffs and the defendant’s Metro Maritime Services. Under

this agreement, Metro Maritime was required to provide design, consultancy and engineering

services to the plaintiffs in connection with the production and supply of six aluminium

fast patrol boats to the Sri Lankan Navy.The contract price is US$2,250,000. The documents

produced to the court included a draft letter (DB-156) which contains a purported request

from Metro Maritime Services to the plaintiffs to remit to the latter a sum of US$650,000

upon the signing of the consultancy agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">113

        None of the plaintiffs’ witnesses seemed

to throw any light on this document. However, having regard to the notations and fax

numbers appearing at the top portion of the draft letter (DB-156), it would appear that

these documents indeed emanated from the office of the plaintiffs. Both De Costa and

Obeysekera denied any knowledge of the said documents. Nonetheless, having regard to all

the evidence, I was left with a clear impression that there was in existence a ploy by

some executives of the plaintiffs to siphon off funds from the plaintiffs’ coffers.

The explanations of De Costa on this aspect left much to be desired.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">114

        There is also one other detail which ought to

be attended to presently. This is in relation to the non-availability of Vitharana who was

employed by Ceylon Shipping Agency. The court was informed that the defendant’s

subpoena to call him as his witness could not be served on him as he was not available for

service. The plaintiffs who ought to have known his whereabouts did not oblige either.

After much delay, when the court was about to hear final speeches, the court was told of

the availability of Vitharana to testify on behalf of the defendant. It was claimed that

Vitharana would say that it was Obeysekera who caused him to not to give evidence earlier.

The plaintiffs objected to this evidence on grounds Obeysekera is currently away and not

available to rebut the allegations levelled against him. I upheld the objection not merely

because of the prejudice that might befall the plaintiffs due to the absence of Obeysekera

but because the evidence of Vitharana appeared to be connected only with the past dealings

between De Costa and the defendant as well as in relation to the receipt of a copy of the

consultancy agreement through fax from the plaintiffs’ Colombo office. On both these

issues, I felt there was no need for any further evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">115

        To recapitulate, in my determination, the

evidence of the defendant that he disbursed the monies in the manner he had detailed in

his testimony, defies belief. Equally, I found the evidence of De Costa disconcerting in a

number of aspects. The explanations offered by Obeysekera on the consultancy agreement

were also feeble. What now remains for me to consider is the effect of their evidence on

the claim of the plaintiffs. I will revisit this aspect after I have addressed the second

issue raised.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">116

        Let me now deal with the second issue. Counsel

for the second defendant contended that the remittance was for an illegal purpose. He

invited my attention to two well known legal maxims: ‘<i>ex turpi causa non oritur

actio’</i> and ‘<i>in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis</i>.’

According to Black’s Law Dictionary (6<sup>th</sup> Edn) the first maxim signifies

that out of a base, illegal or immoral consideration, an action does not and cannot arise.

The second maxim stands for the principle (see also Black’s Law Dictionary) (6<sup>th</sup>

Edn) that in a case of equal or mutual fault between two parties, the condition of the

party in possession or defending is the better one. Where each party is equally at fault,

the law favours him who is actually in possession. Where the fault is mutual, the law will

leave the case as it is.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">117

        Defence counsel contended that even assuming

that the defendant did not carry out what he was instructed to do by the plaintiffs or by

De Costa, it was clear that the purpose for which the US$650,000 was remitted was illegal.

It is therefore unenforceable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">118

        Reliance was placed on <i><b>Alexander v Rayson</b></i>

[1936] 1 KB 169, where the English Court of Appeal reiterated the principle that where it

appears that the subject matter of an agreement is intended to be used for unlawful

purpose, the court will refuse to enforce it. The judgment of Romer LJ (read by Scott LJ

and concurred by Greer LJ) at page 182 reads:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    It is settled law that an agreement to do an act that is illegal or immoral or contrary to

    public policy, or to do any act for a consideration that is illegal, immoral or contrary

    to public policy, is unlawful and therefore void. But it often happens that an agreement

    which in itself is not unlawful is made with the intention of one or both parties to make

    use of the subject matter for an unlawful purpose, that is to say a purpose that is

    illegal, immoral or contrary to public policy. The most common instance of this is an

    agreement for the sale or letting of an object, where the agreement is unobjectionable on

    the face of it, but where the intention of both or one of the parties is that the object

    shall be used by the purchaser or hirer for an unlawful purpose. In such a case any party

    to the agreement who had the unlawful intention is precluded from suing upon it. Ex turpi

    causa non oritur actio. The action does not lie because the Court will not lend its help

    to such a plaintiff. Many instances of this are to be found in the books.</font></p>

    In <i>Gas Light &amp; Coke Co.</i> v. <i>Turner</i> (I) the plaintiffs had demised certain

    premises to the defendant to be used by him for an unlawful purpose. It was held that the

    plaintiffs were not entitled to sue the defendant upon the covenant for rent in the lease.

    We shall have to refer to this case later upon another point. In <i>Pearce</i> v. <i>Brooks</i>

    (2) a coach builder had let out a brougham on hire to a prostitute for the purpose of

    enabling her (to use the words of Pollock C.B.) "to make a display favourable to her

    immoral purposes." The coach builder subsequently sued the prostitute for moneys

    payable under the agreement. It was held by the Court of Exchequer that he could not

    recover. "I have always considered it as settled law," said the Chief Baron,

    "that any person who contributes to the performance of an illegal act by supplying a

    thing with the knowledge that it is going to be used for that purpose, cannot recover the

    price of the thing so supplied." He added: "Nor can any distinction be made

    between an illegal and an immoral purpose; the rule which is applicable to the matter is,

    ex turpi causa non oritur actio, and whether it is an immoral or an illegal purpose in

    which the plaintiff has participated, it comes equally within the terms of that maxim, and

    the effect is the same; no cause of action can arise out of either the one or the

    other."</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">119

        The principle upon which a contract may be

impeached on account of illegality is also dealt with by the authors of <i><b>Chitty on

Contract</b></i> (26<sup>th</sup> Edn, Vol 1, para 1135) in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    … "The principle of public policy," said Lord Mansfield, "is this: <i>ex

    dolo malo non oritur actio</i>. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause

    of action upon an immoral or illegal act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or

    otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise <i>ex turpi causa</i>, or the

    transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has no right to

    be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the sake of the defendant, but

    because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and the

    defendant were to change sides, and the defendant were to bring his action against the

    plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it; for where both are equally at

    fault, <i>potior est conditio defendentis</i>." The "<i>ex turpi causa</i>

    defence," as was stated by Kerr L.J. in <i>Euro-Diam Ltd</i>. v. <i>Bathurst</i>,

    "rests on a principle of public policy that the courts will not assist a plaintiff

    who has been guilty of illegal (or immoral) conduct of which the courts should take

    notice. It applies if in all the circumstances it would be an affront to public conscience

    to grant the plaintiff the relief which he seeks because the court would thereby appear to

    assist or encourage the plaintiff in his illegal conduct or to encourage others in similar

    acts". …</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">120

        Plaintiffs’ counsel contended, on the

other hand, that even if the monies had been handed over for an illegal purpose, this

would not prevent the plaintiffs from recovering the same, if the illegal purpose had not

been carried out.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">121

        In this regard, plaintiffs’ counsel relied

on the following passage from <i><b>Chitty on Contract</b></i> (27<sup>th</sup> Edn, Vol

1, para 16 to 162) which reads:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

    grossly criminal or turpitudinous or if the principal still enjoyed a <i>locus

    poenitentiae</i>. …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">122

        It is instructive at this stage to make

reference to a number of decisions on this particular aspect of the law in relation to

locus poenitentiae (a place or chance of repentance, a power of drawing back from a

bargain before any act is done to confirm it in law).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">123

        In <i><b>Bone v Ekless</b></i> (5 H &amp; N

925, reproduced in 157 ER 1450) the facts are as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">124

        The plaintiff (Bone) sailed to Constantinople

in September, 1856, with directions from the defendant to sell the vessel. There was a

difficulty in effecting the sale, and the plaintiff informed the defendant (Ekless) that

in order to effect a sale it was necessary to bribe the Turkish officials, and he

authorized the plaintiff to do so. He directed the plaintiff to inform him of the nett

price offered for the vessel. The plaintiff telegraphed from Constantinople, ‘Sold

six thousand.’ The defendant telegraphed in reply, ‘Sale confirmed.’ The

defendant wrote to the plaintiff to say he had agreed to sell the ‘Pioneer’ for

6,000 nett; the price to be paid for the vessel being 6,500, and the 500 to be paid

by him to the Turkish officials for effecting the sale. The defendant ratified this sale,

and assented to the application of the 500, and that this was a fraud on the Turkish

government. The 6,500 was paid to the plaintiff by the Turkish government. The plaintiff

remitted 6,000 to the defendant. The plaintiff paid 300 to some of the officers; but

he did not pay, as he had agreed to do, 200 to one J.H., an official who had been

instrumental in effecting the purchase of the vessel; and the plaintiff still retains that

sum in fraud of J.H.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">125

        The action was confirmed only in relation to

the remaining sum of 200. On a case stated to the Court, Bramwell B (concurring with

Martin B and Channell B held:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… The 6500l. was received to

    the defendant’s use, with an authority to apply 500l. in a particular manner. Before

    the whole had been so applied the authority as to part, viz. the 2001. now in question,

    was countermanded. The case therefore falls within the principle upon which <i>Hastelow</i>

    v. <i>Jackson</i> (8 B. &amp; C. 221) was decided, viz. that where money is paid upon an

    illegal agreement it may be recovered back before the execution of the agreement, though

    not afterwards. …</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">126

        Similar views were expressed by the English

Court of Appeal in <i><b>Taylor v Bowers</b></i> (1876) Vol 1 QBD 291. The facts of the

case as appears from the headnotes of the case are as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">127

        The plaintiff, being in embarassed

circumstances, in pursuance of an agreement between him and Alcock made over all his

stock-in-trade to Alcock and fictitious bills of exchange were given by Alcock in

plaintiff’s favour. Possession of the goods was given to Alcock together with an

inventory, but no bill of sale was executed by the plaintiff. The object of the

transaction was to prevent plaintiff’s creditors from getting hold of the goods, and

so being paid in full. Defendant was a creditor for 100, and was cognisant of what was

concocted between the plaintiff and Alcock After Alcock had removed the goods from

plaintiff’s premises, two meetings of plaintiff’s creditors were held, but no

compromise was effected with the creditors. Some months afterwards Alcock executed a bill

of sale of the goods to the defendant, for the alleged purpose of securing the debt due

from the plaintiff to the defendant, but the plaintiff was no party to the bill of sale,

nor did he sanction or know of it. Plaintiff having demanded the goods from Alcock and

defendant, brought an action against defendant for the detention of the goods.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">128

        Affirming the decision of the Queen’s

Bench Division, the Court of Appeal (per James, Mellish LJJ’s Baggallay JA and Grove

J) held that the fraudulent purpose not having been carried out, plaintiff was not relying

on the illegal transaction, but was entitled to repudiate it and recover his goods from

Alcock and the defendant had no better title than Alcock as he knew how Alcock had become

possessed of the goods.</font></p>

        In <i><b>Harry Parker Ltd v Mason</b></i>

[1940] 2 KB 590 at 608, the English Court of Appeal re-affirmed the principle that public

policy is best served by allowing a party to an illegal arrangement to repent before it is

too late and to prevent the completion of the illegal purpose by reclaiming the money paid

by him in pursuance of it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">130

        <i><b>Taylor v Bowers</b></i> (<i>supra</i>)

was distinguished in <i><b>Bigos v Boustead</b></i> [1951] 1 KBD 92. It is a case of

statutory illegality. The facts of the case are as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">131

        In 1947 the defendant was anxious to send his

wife and daughter abroad for the sake of the daughter’s health. Owing to the

restrictions on English currency which were then in force he was unable to obtain from the

Treasury what he considered an adequate allowance to enable them to stay abroad

sufficiently long for the visit to be of benefit to the daughter. On August 25, 1947, he

entered into an agreement with the plaintiff, in contravention of the Exchange Control

Act, 1947, s. 1(1), whereby the plaintiff agreed to make available 150 worth of Italian

money for the wife and daughter in Italy within a week and the defendant promised to repay

her with English money in England. As security for his promise, the defendant deposited

with the plaintiff a share certificate for 140 shares in a company. On August 28, the

defendant’s wife and daughter went to Italy, but the plaintiff failed to make any

Italian money available for them, and on October 13, they returned to England, sooner than

they would have returned if they had the money. The defendant then asked the plaintiff to

return to him his share certificate, but she refused to do so. In an action by the

plaintiff to recover the sum of 150 from the defendant on the ground that she had made a

loan to him of that sum, the defendant denied the loan, set out the true facts of the

transaction, and counterclaimed for the return of the certificate. The plaintiff abandoned

her claim at the commencement of the hearing of the action, but the defendant proceeded

with his counterclaim and contended that, although the contract was an illegal one, as it

was still executory he was allowed a <i>locus poenitentiae</i>, and, therefore, he was

entitled to claim the return of the certificate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">132

        In dismissing the defendant’s counterclaim

on the basis that the facts was on all fours with <i><b>Alexander v Rayson</b></i> (<i>supra</i>)

Pritchard J held that the reason that the illegal transaction was not carried out was due,

not to any repentance on the part of the defendant, but to the frustration of the contract

by the plaintiff, and, therefore, as the agreement relating to the deposit of the share

certificate was one which sprang from the main illegal agreement and was tainted with the

same illegality as that which attached to that agreement, and as the parties were <i>in

pari delicto</i> at the time of making the agreement, the defendant was not entitled to

seek the aid of the court to recover the certificate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">133

        The approach taken by Pritchard J in <i><b>Bigos</b></i>

did not quite meet the approval of the Court of Appeal in a later case. Millett LJ (as he

then was) in <i><b>Tribe v Tribe</b></i> [1995] 3 WLR 913, observed at pages 938 and 939:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The doctrine of the locus

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    It is impossible to reconcile all the authorities on the circumstances in which a party to

    an illegal contract is permitted to withdraw from it. At one time he was allowed to

    withdraw so long as the contract had not been completely performed; but later it was held

    that recovery was barred once it had been partly performed: see <i>Kearley v. Thomson</i>

    (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 742. It is clear that he must withdraw voluntarily, and that it is not

    sufficient that he is forced to do so because his plan has been discovered. In <i>Bigos v.

    Bousted</i> [1951] 1 All E.R.<i> 92 this was, perhaps dubiously, extended to prevent

    withdrawal where the scheme has been frustrated by the refusal of the other party to carry

    out his part.</i></font></p>

    Ground for Repudiation" (1975) 91 L.Q.R. 313 and Merkin, "Restitution by

    Withdrawal from Executory Illegal Contracts" (1981) 97 L.Q.R. 420 are required

    reading for anyone who attempts the difficult task of defining the precise limits of the

    doctrine. I would draw back from any such attempt. But I would hold that genuine

    repentance is not required. Justice is not a reward for merit; restitution should not be

    confined to the penitent. I would also hold that voluntary withdrawal from an illegal

    transaction when it has ceased to be needed is sufficient. It is true that this is not

    necessary to encourage withdrawal, but a rule to the opposite effect could lead to bizzare

    results. <i>Suppose, for example, that in Bigos v. Bousted [1951] 1 All E.R. 92 exchange

    control had been abolished before the foreign currency was made available: it is absurd to

    suppose that the plaintiff should have been denied restitution. I do not agree that it was

    correct in Groves v Groves, 3 Y. &amp; J. 163, 174, and similar cases for the court to

    withhold its assistance from the plaintiff because "if the crime has not been

    completed, the merit was not his.</i>" </font></p>

        Reverting to the facts of the case, it is

apparent that the problem concerning the sum of US$650,000 seemed to have arisen almost

immediately after the defendant had received the sum. The defendant’s evidence that

he paid out over Rs 24 million to the three government officials and the remainder, save

for a sum of US$32,500 which he was entitled to, was paid out to De Costa and Obeysekera,

did not, in my finding, appear to have any ring of truth around it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">135

        In my evaluation, if what the defendant now

claims is the truth, he would have erupted in white heat and recounted at once what he now

alleges to be the truth to Yamanaka when he went to see him. The defendant who had seen

fit to send the six pages of documents to disclose his past financial dealings with De

attempting to make.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">136

        Further, his letter dated 24 September 1998

addressed to the legal manager of the plaintiffs would not also have stated as it did,

that the remittance was solely his fees for disbursements and services rendered to De

Costa. In my determination, the narration of events by the defendant that he bribed Sri

Lankan officials and paid out a substantial portion of the remittance to De Costa and

Obeysekera was a late invention. In my view, De Costa and Obeysekera would not have come

forward to fix the defendant, if indeed they had been paid as claimed by the defendant.</font></p>

        Counsel for the plaintiffs traced the movement

of the sum of US$650,000 from the OUB documents of the plaintiff. The summary produced by

counsel at para 133 of his submission reads as follows:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">138

        Reviewing the totality of the evidence, I am of

the view that the claim by the defendant that he obtained nearly Rs 24,650,000 (equivalent

to US$425,000) in July 1997 from Fernando without any documentation for the purposes of

paying bribes to Sri Lankan government officials as well as De Costa and Obeysekera, is

not supported by any credible or creditworthy evidence. I must add here that the stories

narrated by Fernando and Rajapakse defy credence and cannot be relied upon. The

defendant’s credibility is further entirely devalued by the cogent evidence of

officers from the Seylan Bank that the statements (exh P-9) furnished by the

defendants’ solicitors were fake. Further, the movements of the funds in the

defendant’s Singapore bank account also do not seem to support the defendant’s

story.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">139

        I must now deal with the defence argument that

the remittance from the plaintiffs to Singapore was for an illegal purpose in that its

object was to bribe captains and crews of ships in connection with the plaintiffs’

business. De Costa as well as Obeysekera, admitted in their evidence that the money was

for business promotion purposes and that it was intended as a form of incentive or

inducement to ships’ crew, with a view to attracting work for the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">140

        In my opinion, even if the monies were intended

for the purposes of some illegitimate motive, there was no evidence placed before the

court to conclude that any gratification was in fact given to any crew member of any ship

by anyone from the funds provided. Inasmuch as the proposed objective to bribe had not

been carried out, the intention to offer gratification remained only incipient and not

executed. In the circumstances, so long as the execution of the illegal purpose has not

been carried out, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum from the defendant. In my

opinion, the plaintiffs’ repudiation is both timeous and voluntary. In this, I find

that the plaintiffs have satisfied the test laid in <i><b>Taylor v Bowers</b></i> read

with <i><b>Tribe v Tribe</b></i> (<i>supra</i>).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">141

        Before I conclude, I must also deal with the

aspect whether the possible involvements of De Costa or for that matter Obeysekera in a

scheme to siphon off funds from the plaintiffs, would in any way infect the claim of the

plaintiffs for the refund. In my evaluation, De Costa is no saint. It might well be that

he was involved in a scheme together with the defendant to siphon off funds from the

plaintiffs. But neither he nor Obeysekera, the second person accused by the defendant, is

the alter ego of the plaintiffs. The claimants in the present action are a public listed

corporation. They are a separate legal entity and have amply satisfied me that that they

had demanded the return of the sum remitted voluntarily and well before the monies were

utilized for any improper or illegitimate purpose. In my opinion, they are not infected

nor sullied by any artful contrivances of any of their officers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">142

        In my determination, the defendant who has

admitted the receipt of the sum, has not discharged the burden on balance of probabilities

that he expended the monies for the benefit or on behalf of the plaintiffs. The

defendant’s evidence is completely discredited not only by the improbabilities of his

account but also by the false Seylan Bank statements which the defendant attempted to

pass, as the true reflection of his state of accounts with the Seylan Bank.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">143

        In the premises, I am of the view that the

plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as prayed for in the re-amended statement of claim ie,

for the sum of US$649,187.50 as well as costs. They are also entitled to interest on the

judgment sum at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of writ until date of judgment. The

plaintiffs are further granted a declaration that the defendant is holding the said sum of

US$649,187.50 upon trust for the plaintiffs.</font></p>
