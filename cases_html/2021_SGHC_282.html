On 30 August 2021, Dr Goh elected to give evidence in the show cause hearing, and was subjected to cross-examination by the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Morgan. On 19 October 2021, after hearing the submissions by counsel for both parties, I found Dr Goh to be in contempt of court, and ordered that he be punished for such contempt by serving a seven-day term of imprisonment, which was to commence on 9 November 2021 (the “Order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 5 November 2021, Dr Goh filed an appeal against the Order, and on 8 November 2021, upon his application, I granted a stay of execution. I now give the grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the main action, <span class="font-italic">Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another</span> [2019] SGHC 284 (the “Judgment”), the Plaintiff sued Dr Goh for misrepresentation and breach of contract concerning the sale of certain shares by Dr Goh to the Plaintiff for a sum in excess of S$30m (the “Sales Proceeds”). On 5 December 2019, Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) gave judgment in favour of the Plaintiff and ordered that Dr Goh repay the Plaintiff S$30.7m. At [265] of the Judgment, it was further ordered that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event that [Dr Goh] does not repay the … $30,700,000 … within 30 days from the date of this decision … [Dr Goh] is to account for the sales proceeds and a consequential tracing order for those proceeds is granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I shall refer to this as the “Tracing Order”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Dr Goh did not pay the sum ordered, nor any part of it. Indeed, even as at the date of my Order, the sum remained wholly unsatisfied. As a consequence of Dr Goh’s failure to pay the judgment debt, the Tracing Order came into effect on 5 January 2020, and he became liable to account for the Sales Proceeds. On 13 March 2020, the Plaintiff filed a summons in this action, summons no 1453 of 2020 (“SUM 1453”),

It stated that the Plaintiff was “completely unconvinced that [he had] simply forgotten what happened to the Funds [in the HSBC-GZ Account]”, but was prepared to give him “one final opportunity to comply with ORC 3219 fully”.

</div> It was only at this point that Dr Goh departed from his earlier position that he could not remember what had happened with the Funds. On 22 September 2020, he responded to D&amp;N – by way of email – that the Funds had been “expended to Chinese businessmen [to] whom [he] owed financial obligations”. However, he provided no details as he claimed that he was unable to recall any, and that he was “still waiting for HSBC China to assist”.

Therefore, on 24 September 2020, D&amp;N sent a further letter to Dr Goh which stated the following. First, that the Plaintiff disagreed that HSBC China would be able to render any assistance as any bank statements it could provide would show no more than the bare account numbers to whom any transfers of the Funds were made. They would not indicate the identities of these “Chinese businessmen”. Second, given the minimal utility of such statements, that Dr Goh was to file a further affidavit – no later than 30 September 2020 – identifying the “Chinese businessmen” and providing documentary proof of the financial obligations owed to them.

Before I do so, however, it is worth nothing that, prior to the hearing, the Plaintiff commenced bankruptcy examination proceedings under s 83 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) against Dr Goh. This took place on 12 and 13 April 2021 before Assistant Registrar Sim Junhui (the “Examination Proceedings”). During these proceedings, Dr Goh said that the “Chinese businessmen” referenced in his earlier 22 September 2020 email were, in fact, casino junkets. He claimed to be a very big gambler, and that he had lost the Funds in the HSBC-GZ Account on gambling in Macau. Specifically, he stated that both amounts of ¥39,428,736 and ¥46,720,151.01 – forming the subject of the HSBC Orders – were <span class="font-italic">completely </span>lost in this way.

More specifically, he claimed that the multiple and protracted law suits he faced had “overwhelmed [him] with information”. He was thus “unable to completely recall whether [he] had received the entirety of the Sale Proceeds and if so where these monies [had been] transferred to, and whether the monies relate[d] to the Sale Proceeds or some other unrelated transaction raised in a separate suit”.

The only outstanding question, insofar as liability was concerned, was whether he possessed the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In this regard, I need only refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span><span class="font-italic"> Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“<span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span>”). Here, the court stated at [51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In so far as the party to the court order is concerned, it would appear that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the court order was intentional and that it knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order</span> (including, of course, knowledge of the existence of the order and of all of its material terms (see the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re L (A Ward)</span> [1988] 1 FLR 255 at 259)). However, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is unnecessary to prove that that party appreciated that it was breaching the order</span>. As Sachs LJ put it in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Knight v Clifton </span>[1971] Ch 700 at 721, “[the] prohibition is absolute and is not to be related to intent unless otherwise stated on the face of the order”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Dr Goh’s own evidence showed that he intended to withhold information from the Plaintiff despite being ordered to provide a <span class="font-italic">full account</span>. Even if he genuinely considered himself justified in temporarily withholding information from the Plaintiff until such a time as he could provide a more complete account, that would not have affected my finding that he possessed the requisite mental state. This was because, as <span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span> suggests, it was not relevant whether Dr Goh appreciated that – by holding back information – he would be in breach of ORC 3129. It was sufficient that he <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> – as opposed to inadvertently – held back such information. Given his knowledge at the time he affirmed the July 2020 and August 2020 Affidavits, Dr Goh certainly had such intention. Furthermore, in his attempt to hold back this information, he had aggravated the contempt by lying in his affidavits that he was unable to recall what happened to the Funds. For these reasons, I found Dr Goh guilty of contempt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate punishment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The punishment for contempt can range from a warning to a fine and to imprisonment. What an appropriate punishment should be for any particular contempt plainly depends on the circumstances of the individual case, and I now turn to my reasons for imposing a seven-day imprisonment term on Dr Goh. In this regard, I considered his conduct in the enforcement proceedings of the Tracing Order, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in SUM 1453; as well as in the contempt proceedings before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I do not think that the details of the underlying litigation that resulted in the Judgment are of much relevance. However, the circumstances surrounding the Plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">efforts</span> in enforcing the Judgment and the Tracing Order are, in my view, relevant to sentencing. According to Ms Morgan (and this is not denied by Dr Goh), the Plaintiff made multiple demands for payment of the judgment sum which were ignored by Dr Goh; he did not even make any request for extension of time to make payment. This attitude continued even after the Tracing Order came into effect, and the Plaintiff sought to pursue it. Indeed, his conduct before the commencement of the contempt proceedings, in my view, suggests a rather cavalier attitude towards ORC 3219.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 First, on 5 January 2020, 30 days after the Judgment of 5 December 2019, the Tracing Order came into effect. However, quite shortly after this, on 6 March 2020, Dr Goh filed the bankruptcy action in B 940 for him to be declared bankrupt. Whether or not this was specifically done to thwart the Plaintiff’s enforcement efforts is not necessarily the point. Dr Goh <span class="font-italic">would</span><span class="font-italic"> have</span> known that it would affect their efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, although he was adjudged a bankrupt on 19 March 2020, it was not until 17 April 2020 that the Plaintiff learnt of this, and it did so from a letter issued by the court, <span class="font-italic">not</span> Dr Goh.

</div> Not only was information about these sums of money not earlier volunteered in his July 2020 and August 2020 Affidavits, but the explanations Dr Goh also ultimately gave during the Examination Proceedings were still not particularly helpful to the Plaintiff, and further, not very reasonable in context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Fourth, for the purposes of his B 940 application, Dr Goh also affirmed an affidavit on 6 March 2020, in which he stated that the cause of his insolvency was “business failure”.

</div> I did not find that he had yet purged himself of his contempt. To date, all Dr Goh has substantively stated is that he had gambled away the Funds, and to this end, he gave evidence that he was a high roller whose bets could go as high as S$750,000. This was not a satisfactory account, given: (a) that he only raised the claim that he was a gambler in the April 2021 Examination Proceedings; and (b) has not produced any evidence proving that he was in fact such a high rolling gambler. To accept that Dr Goh has discharged his obligations under the Tracing Order on the grounds of such bare assertions would fundamentally undermine the Plaintiff’s victory in the main action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In connection, I note that the Plaintiff did not believe that Dr Goh had indeed lost the Funds in the HSBC-GZ Account to gambling, and was of the view that he was actively impeding her efforts to trace the Funds. This was not surprising, though, not a factor I thought appropriate to take into account for the purposes of sentencing given that it was not proven before me, even though the inference was strong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 That said, even if Dr Goh’s gambling explanation was to be taken at face value, he had still lied in <span class="font-italic">two</span> affidavits. Further, I found the particular manner in which he lied to be aggravating factors. It is difficult to prove a person is lying when he claims he cannot recall something, and a cynical resort to this device, which is clearly what Dr Goh had hoped to do, aggravates the fact that he had chosen to lie. As I have stated from [32] to [38] above, Dr Goh had displayed a cavalier attitude with sums in the tens of millions of dollars that he had caused the Plaintiff to lose. Not only did he refuse to cooperate, but he also chose to tell a deliberate lie in the July 2020 and August 2020 Affidavits in the face of a direct order of court, the effect of which was to delay the execution process and increase costs for the Plaintiff. This behaviour clearly called for punishment with a term of imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Ms Morgan urged upon me to punish Dr Goh for contempt by ordering him to be imprisoned for no less than seven months,

</div> I accept this to be the case. However, in my view, a sentence of seven months would cause even further delays to the accounting process. As I observed above, these contempt proceedings appear to have put some pep into Dr Goh’s step. Even if nothing meaningful has yet turned up, I can see that he has now applied effort towards complying with ORC 3219, albeit belatedly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am therefore of the view that a short and sharp seven-day period of imprisonment would be appropriate punishment for the contempt Dr Goh has displayed. This serves to impress upon him that his blatant lying in the face of a court order poses a serious obstruction in the administration of justice, and also to signal to him that he should henceforth make the fullest efforts to comply with the Tracing Order in ORC 3129. Any further failure to do so may visit upon him a further, more severe punishment for contempt.
