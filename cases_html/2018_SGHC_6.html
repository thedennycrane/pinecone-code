He did not say how long he would be there, but Maneerat expected the trip to be short as Ng only brought limited personal belongings. Initially, Maneerat gave him 100,000 baht (about S$4,730) to purchase stock for his sound systems business. In September 2006, she remitted an additional S$1,800 to Ng as the latter informed her that he needed more money. During this period, Maneerat had intermittent contact with Ng.

For instance, Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC in his book on evidence law opines that s 109 is a “presumption of the continuance of life”. In other words, once it is shown that the subject is alive within the last 30 years, the applicant must prove that the subject is dead. However, the “presumption of the continuance of life in s 109 may be countered by the presumption of death under s 110” if the applicant proves that those who would naturally have heard of him have not within the last seven years. When the “presumption of death” applies, the party alleging that the subject is alive must prove that he is alive (Jeffrey Pinsler,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 12.052).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Professor Pinsler’s position is consistent with the Indian authors who have analysed the precursors to ss 109 and 110, which have the same wording as these sections. In the seminal Indian text of Sudipto Sarkar &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</span>, Vol 2 (Wadhwa Nagpur, 16th Ed, 2007) at p 1694, the authors also note that s 107 (the precursor to s 109) deals with the presumption of continuation of life and s 108 (the precursor to s 110) the presumption of death. The authors further describe s 108 as “enact[ing] a proviso” to s 107 by specifying that when a person is absent for seven years, he can be presumed to have died and the burden “shifts” to those who assert that he is alive to prove that he is alive. The authors explain that both sections are deduced from the presumption that a person who is alive within 30 years of the application date continues to be alive unless the presumption of “continuation” is no longer applicable by virtue of the seven-year silence period. In other words, the two sections work hand in hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 An even more explicit position was taken in Y V Chandrachud &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Dhirajlal’s The Law of Evidence</span> (Wadhwa Nagpur, 22nd Enlarged Edition, 2006) at p 1149. The authors of this Indian text state that the two sections “must be read together because the latter [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 110] is only a proviso to the rule contained in the former [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 109] and both constitute one rule when so read together”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 From the above authorities, we can glean the following approach to be taken for an application to declare that the subject is dead under ss 109–110:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point is s 109. If there are facts to show that the subject was alive within the last 30 years, then the subject is presumed to be alive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The applicant must then prove that the subject is dead (contrary to this presumption).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) One of the ways to prove that the subject is dead is by showing that he has not contacted persons he would naturally be expected to contact in the last seven years. But even when this is shown, the subject will not have been proven to be dead. Rather, this only raises a presumption of death under s 110, which can still be rebutted by any interested person. Once the presumption of death under s 110 is raised, the burden of rebutting that presumption by proving that the subject is alive falls on any party who wishes to do so under s 110.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Of course, apart from using the presumption of death in s 110, there are also other ways of proving that the subject is dead. One example is if the applicant has affirmative evidence of the subject’s death. This was what happened in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Khee v Legal Representative of the Estate of Ong Koh Tee, deceased</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 212. Kan Ting Chiu JC (as he then was) found that although the applicant sought a declaration that the subject was dead, she was not seeking to establish his death through the presumption under s 110. She did not present evidence that the subject had disappeared for more than seven years, but only relied on affidavit evidence by herself and another person which stated that they had personal knowledge that the subject was dead. Kan JC held that in such situations, the s 110 presumption would not be operative and she would have to independently prove the subject’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The above approach that I have outlined is consistent with the wording of s 110. Section 110 provides that where the applicant proves that those who would naturally hear from the subject have not heard of him for seven years, then “the burden of proving that he is alive is <span class="font-italic">shifted</span> to the person who affirms it” [emphasis added]. This burden is <span class="font-italic">shifted</span> from the initial burden of proof established in s 109, where it is for the party seeking to show that the subject is dead to prove it. Thus, an applicant who wishes to obtain a declaration that the subject is dead would find the presumption that the subject is dead in s 110 (as he has not been heard of for seven or more years) helpful. Hence, ss 109 and 110 work in tandem.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The requirements under s 110 of the EA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Having established that ss 109 and 110 function together, I shall now explain how an applicant can employ s 110 to support his application to declare that the subject is dead. There are two requirements for the presumption under s 110 to operate (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The subject must not have been heard of for seven years.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The subject must not have been heard of by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 When ascertaining whether these two requirements are met, there are two potential issues that the courts have had to deal with:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Who are those who would “naturally have heard of [the subject] if he had been alive”?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) What does it mean to have “naturally… heard of” the subject?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Persons who would naturally have heard of the subject</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On issue (a), the broad consensus in the decided cases is that although persons related by blood or marriage would typically be those who would “naturally have heard of” the subject if he had been alive (see <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [19]), this is not always the case. In <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span>, the court held that the subject was totally estranged from his wife and children and appeared to have wanted nothing more to do with them. The court found that the subject’s wife and children could not be considered as those who would naturally have heard of the subject as “they would probably be the last persons whom he would want to contact” (<span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> at [23]). In contrast, the subject in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> was shown to have a good relationship with his parents and siblings prior to his disappearance. They were therefore found to be such persons who would naturally have heard of the subject (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [21]). To these observations I would add that it is not necessary that a person must have familial relations with the subject in order to be considered a person who would “naturally have heard of” the subject. As the cases demonstrate, this inquiry is an entirely factual one. Naturally, familial relations would allow the court to infer such closeness. The applicant must also establish that prior to the disappearance of the subject, the latter had a close relationship with the persons to the extent that he considered them to be his confidantes such that he could be expected to keep in constant contact with them wherever he may be.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the applicant (or persons who would naturally have heard of the subject) must take sufficient steps to ascertain if the subject is alive</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The position is somewhat ambiguous for issue (b). As the court noted in <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span>, a literal construction of s 110 itself might suggest that the second requirement is fulfilled so long as the persons under issue (a) have not literally heard of the subject (<span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> at [30]). This interpretation does not require the applicant or the persons under issue (a) to take further steps to ascertain whether or not the subject was still alive. However, Phang JC opined that this literal construction in <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>may not be sufficient. He held that there was a common law requirement that the applicant must take such steps to ascertain whether the subject was alive. In finding such a common law requirement to be “incorporated as part of s 110 itself” (<span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> at [30]), Phang JC did not expressly state whether this was found within the wording of s 110 or whether this was an additional common law requirement that had to be fulfilled. He also did not consider whether the common law requirement was consistent with the wording of s 110 although he observed in passing that it “is true that, on a literal construction of s 110 itself, it <span class="font-italic">might</span> be argued that that provision does not include this particular requirement” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The existence of this requirement at common law was affirmed by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [22]. She interpreted <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> as authority for the proposition that “[this] requirement was not statutorily imposed in Singapore but … should be adhered to as a matter set down by common law” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [23]). As to the necessity of the requirement, Prakash J held that this requirement to take sufficient steps was not a compulsory one which had to be fulfilled before the court could find that s 110 applies. Rather, “it would all depend on the circumstances before the court as to whether it should require any particular applicant to fulfil [this] requirement” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 While I agreed that the requirement to take sufficient steps to ascertain whether the subject is still alive originated from the common law, I was of the view that this requirement is not only consistent with but is also found in the wording of s 110. This question is important because s 2(2) of the EA provides that “[a]ll rules of evidence not contained in any written law, so far as such rules are inconsistent with any of the provisions of [the EA], are repealed”. Hence, at the very least, the common law requirement must not be inconsistent with s 110. But as I have noted, my view is that this requirement is in fact implicit in the wording of s 110 itself, namely, the phrase “[the subject] has not been heard of … by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I agreed with the observation in <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> that a narrow reading of this phrase may suggest that it is sufficient for the applicant (or those who would expect to hear of the subject) to have simply not heard of the subject without further prompting, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one-way communication. However, I found that a wider reading of this phrase gave better effect to the object and purpose of s 110. The category of persons who would naturally have heard of the subject if he had been alive would have built a strong enough relationship with the subject in order for him to contact them in such a situation in the first place. Therefore, the natural behaviour of such persons, upon knowing that the subject had gone missing, would be to attempt to establish contact with him and not merely to wait for contact from him. If there were no such communications, this category of persons would likely also have taken steps to find out what had happened to the subject.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Hearing <span class="font-italic">of</span> the subject in the context of s 110 involves more than one-way communications. The natural meaning of ‘hearing of the subject’ is wide enough to encompass the situation where the applicant takes additional steps to search for the subject’s whereabouts and subsequently discovers information about him that would not have been discovered without such steps. Accordingly, the interpretation of the words in s 110 should not be read narrowly to embody the common law requirement to take sufficient steps. While I understand that <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> considered <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> authority for the proposition that the common law requirement is not statutorily embodied in the words of s 110, <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> did not explicitly say this. In any event, I would have considered this observation in either or both cases to be <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> as they were not decided on that point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the sufficient steps requirement is compulsory</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The next question is whether this requirement is compulsory or that the court can choose whether to require the applicant to take such steps. <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span> took the latter view and distinguished <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span> on the facts. Although Prakash J did not explain why the sufficient steps requirement was not compulsory, she opined that where there is a possibility of such abuse, the court would require the applicant to take the additional steps.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I have earlier explained that a wider reading of s 110 embodies the common law requirement to take steps to ascertain the whereabouts of the subject. Therefore, the logical consequence is that this requirement is compulsory. The purpose of the requirement is to prevent abuse. If the bar is kept too low, this may be prejudicial or detrimental to the subject should he later appear to be alive. Accordingly, the application for a presumption of death must be taken seriously and all reasonable measures to trace the subject’s whereabouts must have been taken, even if they are ultimately unsuccessful. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain whether the subject is alive</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Before I turn to the facts of this case, I shall briefly set out what constitute sufficient steps. In short, the decided cases suggest that this is a fact-driven exercise. What constitute sufficient steps in each case depends on the actions taken by the applicant (or the persons who would naturally have heard of the subject) to follow the leads that they have.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Christina Wong</span>, Phang JC found that insufficient steps were taken. The applicant sent letters to the subject’s address in the US in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Phang JC stated that this was insufficient since the subject had left for the US in 1979 and had given his eldest daughter a power of attorney in 1994. By 1999, it had been five years since the power of attorney was given and there was no guarantee that the subject lived at the same address (at [32]–[33]). The applicant also placed advertisements in local and US newspapers in 2001 and 2004 but Phang JC found that these were token efforts, being too few and far between. The odds of the subject having had notice of these advertisements were extremely low (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kornrat Sriponnok</span>, Choo J found the steps taken insufficient. The subject was a Thai national who had returned to Thailand. The applicant had placed only one newspaper advertisement in a Thai local newspaper more than ten years after her disappearance and Choo J opined that this may have been insufficient even if the presumption under s 110 applied (at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In contrast, sufficient steps were taken by the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Soo Ngak Hee</span>. The applicant had contacted the subject’s friends, searched places that the subject frequented, lodged a police report on the subject’s disappearance (following which the police conducted investigations but to no avail), and conducted Internet searches. None of these yielded results. Prakash J found that there were no other leads that the applicant and his family could have followed (at [25]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The common element in these cases is that where the efforts to locate the subject were merely tokenistic and there were leads that could have been followed up on but not done, then the court would find that insufficient steps had been taken. The crux is whether the steps taken were either:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) thorough enough such that one would expect the subject to be found (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, through extensive police reports or investigations, or even through newspaper advertisements such that others overseas may know of the subject and respond to a missing person report); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) extensive enough such that one would expect the subject to notice them and reply to the applicant or the person who would naturally have heard of the subject (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, through notices in newspapers).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As I have reiterated, the natural behaviour of people who care for the subject would be to take such thorough and extensive steps to locate him. That said, the specific actions and reactions of the people who would naturally have heard of the subject will vary in each case depending on the facts and the available leads. Having set out these general principles, I shall now examine the steps taken by Maneerat and Ng’s father.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the steps taken by Maneerat and Ng’s father to locate Ng were sufficient</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The evidence showed that Ng ceased to contact Maneerat or his father since September 2006. First, this triggered s 109 of the EA because this is proof that Ng was alive in the 30 years preceding the application. He would therefore be presumed alive unless Maneerat could show otherwise. Second, since Maneerat relied on the rebuttal presumption of death in s 110 of the EA, she had to show that Ng had not contacted her and his father for at least seven years, that she and Ng’s father were the persons who would naturally have heard of him, and that sufficient steps to locate Ng were taken. Of the three requirements, the first was satisfied as Ng had not contacted Maneerat and his father for more than seven years since September 2006.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I found that Maneerat and Ng’s father were the persons who would naturally have heard of Ng if he were alive. Maneerat was Ng’s wife and had provided Ng with financial support during the trip. In her affidavit, Maneerat stated that she had provided Ng with money on at least two occasions in relation to this trip alone.

</div> It was doubtful whether Ng was serious about his return to Singapore. Ng appeared to be in financial difficulty which could be why he left Singapore for Thailand in the first place.

</div> I was not convinced by this explanation. For the last 11 years when Ng was in Thailand (since 2006), Maneerat appeared able to service the mortgage on the flat. No explanation was given as to why there was a sudden change in her circumstances. Against this, I had to consider that Maneerat was the applicant seeking the declaration and was also the direct beneficiary of the declaration if it were made. Balancing these two factors, it appeared that there was a possibility that s 110 would be used as a device of convenience for collateral purposes (see above at [25]–[26]). I therefore had to ascertain whether Maneerat and Ng’s father had taken sufficient steps to ascertain whether Ng was alive given the circumstances surrounding Ng’s disappearance and Maneerat’s application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I was not convinced that Maneerat and Ng’s father had taken all reasonable steps to locate Ng. I shall first summarise the measures taken by them to locate him:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Three police reports were made in 2007, 2012, and 2017. However, the second and third police reports were made for the purposes of assisting Maneerat’s own ICA application and in support of the present application respectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Two advertisements were placed in the newspapers on 16 December 2015 – one in Singapore and one in Thailand. This was for the purpose of getting Ng’s consent for Ter to marry his daughter, since his daughter was at that time a minor.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Letters were sent to various police divisions/headquarters, the ICA, the Ministry of Defence and the Attorney-General’s Chambers in 2017. The letters expressly stated that the information sought was only for the purpose of supporting the present application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It seemed that many of these steps could be described as tokenistic efforts in preparation to support this application. Indeed, most of these steps were expressly stated to be for some other purpose unrelated to Ng’s absence. The primary purpose of these actions was not to ascertain Ng’s whereabouts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 There was also a long break between the events: after 2007, which was when the first police report was filed, the next step was taken some five years later in 2012. When that yielded no results, Maneerat did not follow up until three years later in 2015 when she had another reason to do so. Again, when that proved unfruitful, she took no further steps until 2017 when she wanted to make the present application, which was when she took a flurry of steps.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Apart from the fact that the primary purpose of many of the steps did not appear to be to locate Ng, and the long delay between these events, I also noted that most of these steps were only taken in Singapore and not in Thailand. But Maneerat and Ng’s father had both known that Ng had gone missing in Thailand and they had stated that they were worried since he did not return and did not contact them either. The natural expectation would have been that their efforts should have been focused in Thailand which was where he was last seen or heard. But the only step that was taken was to put out a small newspaper advertisement in one Thai newspaper. I doubted the utility of this advertisement to locate Ng. Maneerat attached to her affidavit an email that Ter (her son-in-law) had sent to one Supavadee asking for an advertisement to be published in a major Thai newspaper. Supavadee had replied stating that “[o]nce [the advertisement was] published, [he would] scan and send [it]” to Ter. No evidence was tendered regarding the follow-up by Supavadee (if any) and what reach the newspaper had. Rather, the dimensions of the advertisement in the email suggested that it was a small one and its primary purpose was related to seeking consent for Maneerat’s daughter to get married.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Furthermore, since Maneerat is a Thai national, I found it strange that she did not go to Thailand to locate Ng. During the oral hearing, I queried her counsel about this disturbing fact. The response given was that she came from Chiang Mai and was not familiar with Bangkok, which was where Ng was last located.

</div> I was unconvinced by these responses as Maneerat, a Thai national who would have no language and cultural barrier, could at least have made some attempt to look for Ng in Thailand. Instead, no attempts, other than a small advertisement in one of the Thai newspapers, were made to try to locate Ng in Thailand. This was highly unsatisfactory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Indeed, this case bore close resemblance to <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kornrat Sriponnok</span>, where Choo J noted that the step of placing one advertisement in one Thai newspaper in a span of ten years may have been insufficient even if the presumption under s 110 applied on the facts. I drew a similar conclusion here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As for Ng’s father, his own affidavit stated that he relied only on Maneerat’s attempts and did not call Ng as Maneerat had informed him that “her own calls to him could not connect”.

</div>
</div> He did not take any other steps. Accordingly, I found that neither Maneerat nor Ng’s father had taken sufficient steps to determine whether Ng was still alive. This was fatal to Maneerat’s application for a declaration under s 110 of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In summary, the appropriate approach for an application under s 110 of the EA is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sections 109 and 110 of the EA function together. Where there are facts that suggest that the subject was alive within the last 30 years, the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that the subject is dead. The applicant can prove the death of the subject by direct or circumstantial evidence, or can use the presumption of death in s 110.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under the presumption of death in s 110, the subject is presumed dead if he has not contacted those who would naturally have heard of him if he were alive for the seven years prior to the application. The burden of proof would then shift to any person interested in proving that the subject is alive to affirm it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It is likely that those who would naturally have heard of the subject if he were alive would include the subject’s immediate family members. But this is not always the case, for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, when the subject is estranged from his family members. The crux of this inquiry is whether the subject has a close enough relationship to such persons (whether family members or not) such that he can be expected to keep in close contact with them.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Even if the relevant persons have not heard of the subject for the last seven years, these persons (including the applicant) will need to take sufficient steps to ascertain whether the subject is alive. This requirement, which originated from the common law, is statutorily embodied in s 110 itself. This is because the obvious behaviour of persons who would naturally have heard of the subject will be to seek him out and take steps to find out if he were alive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) What constitute sufficient steps depends on the facts of each case, including what leads are available, the circumstances surrounding the subject’s absence, and the circumstances surrounding the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this case, Maneerat and Ng’s father had not taken sufficient steps to ascertain whether Ng was alive. Ng had left for Thailand purportedly to avoid his creditors in Singapore and he appeared to be in financial difficulty. There was a lack of genuine attempts to locate him in Thailand. The efforts to find Ng were concentrated in Singapore when the attempts should, more appropriately, have been made in Thailand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, I found that the evidence was insufficient for the court to conclude that sufficient steps were taken to ascertain whether Ng was dead or alive. I therefore dismissed OS 1225.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Low Jianhui (Dew Chambers) for the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
