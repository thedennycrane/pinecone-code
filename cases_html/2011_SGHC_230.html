<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Respondent, Sinesinga Sdn Bhd
                    (“SSB”), which is a transferee of the relevant part of the assets
                    of United Merchant Finance Bhd (“UMF”), obtained judgment of
                    RM5,078,368.03 together with interest and costs in the High Court in Kuala
                    Lumpur, Malaysia against the 1<sup>st</sup> Appellant, Madihill
                    Development Sdn Bhd (“MDS”), for monies due and outstanding under
                    a loan facility granted by UMF to it and against the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Appellant, Dato’ Rickie Tang Yong Kiat
                    (“RT”), pursuant to a guarantee furnished by RT to UMF in respect
                    of the loan facility to MDS. On 18 February 2010, SSB successfully applied to
                    register the Malaysian judgment as a judgment in Singapore under the Reciprocal
                    Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“RECJA”, unless otherwise indicated, all references to statutory
                    provisions are to those in the RECJA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       RT failed in his application on 27 June
                    2011 to set aside the Order of Court dated 18 February 2011 and appealed. I
                    dismissed the appeal on 1 August 2011 and RT has appealed against my
                    decision.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       RT’s appeal is based on a short point. At
                    the time the Malaysian judgment was registered under RECJA, there was an
                    incurable defect as there was a pending appeal before the Malaysian Court of
                    Appeal. Section 3(2)(e) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Restrictions on registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) No judgment shall be ordered to be registered under this section if
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e) the judgment debtor satisfies the registering court either that an
                        appeal is pending, or that he is entitled and intends to appeal, against the
                        judgment;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">RT characterised this as a strict legislative prohibition against
                    registration of a foreign judgment so long as an appeal or a right and intention
                    to appeal is extant. The application was therefore wrong from the outset and had
                    to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       SSB relies on s 3(1) as well as case law.
                    Section 3(1) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.—(1) Where a judgment has been obtained in a superior court of the
                        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the judgment creditor
                        may apply to the High Court at any time within 12 months after the date of
                        the judgment, or such longer period as may be allowed by the Court, to have
                        the judgment registered in the Court, and on any such application the High
                        Court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it thinks it is just and
                        convenient that the judgment should be enforced in Singapore, and subject to
                        this section, order the judgment to be registered accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">SSB further contends that there is no longer any pending appeal as RT
                    has exhausted all avenues of appeal in Malaysia and it is therefore just and
                    convenient to dismiss RT’s application and to allow the 18 February 2010
                    registration of the Malaysian judgment to stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis of the authorities cited</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Fan Kin Ning (“Mr Fan”),
                    counsel for RT, did not produce any authorities and only relied on the statutory
                    provisions and what he contended was the proper construction. Mr Chua Beng
                    Chye (“Mr Chua”), counsel for SSB, relied on four cases for his
                    argument that RT’s construction of ss 3(1) and (2) was wrong.
                    Strictly speaking, none of the authorities relied on by Mr Chua were
                    applicable or relevant on their facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the first case, <em>Perwira
                        Ariffin Bank Bhd (formerly known as Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd) v Lee
                        Hai Pey and another</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 498
                        (“<em>Perwira Ariffin Bank</em>”), a bank
                    had obtained summary judgment in September 1998 in Malaysia against its borrower
                    company and the individual guarantors. The successive appeals were dismissed in
                    October 1990 and in November 1994. On 28 October 1996, the plaintiff
                    applied <em>ex parte</em> to register the Malaysian
                    judgment in Singapore under the RECJA. The guarantor applied to set the
                    Singapore judgment aside on the ground that the Malaysian judgment was no longer
                    enforceable as more than 6 years had passed since the Malaysian judgment was
                    issued. The bank thereupon successfully applied in Malaysia, <em>ex parte</em>, on 23 May 1996 for leave to enforce the Malaysian
                    judgment. With the Malaysian court order in hand, the bank applied afresh to
                    register the Malaysian judgment. On 30 December 1996, the borrower company
                    successfully set aside the Malaysian court order granting leave to enforce the
                    judgment but the guarantor was unsuccessful. The bank and the guarantor filed
                    appeals. The guarantor then applied to set aside the registration of the
                    Malaysian judgment in Singapore pending the determination of the enforceability
                    of the Malaysian judgment by the Malaysian appeal court. His application before
                    the registrar failed and he appealed. On appeal, Warren
                    L H Khoo J held that since the Malaysian judgment before him
                    ceased to be enforceable unless leave of court was obtained, and leave had been
                    obtained <em>ex parte</em> and confirmed by an <em>inter partes</em> hearing, the defendant was entitled to
                    appeal against that decision and had done so. He therefore ordered a stay,
                    pending the outcome of the appeal, as there was no telling which way the
                    judgment will go on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Chua submitted that a pending appeal in the
                    Malaysian court did not prevent the registration of the Malaysian judgment in
                    Singapore, citing <em>Perwira Ariffin Bank</em> at
                        [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I took the view that sub-s (2) does not, and is not intended to, set out
                        in any exhaustive way the circumstances in which a judgment should not be
                        registered. There is a general requirement, set out in sub-s (1), that the
                        court must be satisfied that in all the circumstances it is just and
                        convenient that the judgment be allowed to be enforced. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That paragraph must be read in the context of the factual matrix. The
                    judgment establishing the debt in that case was no longer under appeal. What was
                    under appeal was the order of the Malaysian court granting leave to enforce a
                    judgment after the passage of more than six years after its publication.
                    Section 3(2)(e) therefore was not in issue. In that context, what was
                    before the learned judge was the s 3(1) requirement as to whether in all
                    the circumstances it was just and convenient that the judgment be allowed to be
                    enforced in Singapore. The learned judge cannot be said to have read s 3(2)
                    as subordinate to s 3(1)’s requirements. <em>Perwira
                        Ariffin Bank</em> therefore does not really answer RT’s
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The second case relied upon by Mr Chua,
                        <em>Perwira Affin Bank Bhd (formerly known as Perwira Habib
                        Bank Malaysia Bhd) v Lee Hai Pey and another</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 218, involved the same parties. By now, the appeals against
                    the enforceability of the Malaysian judgment had come to an end. Judith
                    Prakash J held that Khoo J had stayed enforcement as there were
                    appeals pending and since those appeals had been finally dealt with, it was just
                    and convenient to allow the Malaysian judgment to be enforced despite the long
                    delays which had resulted from the guarantors’ utilisation of his right of
                    appeal and not any dilatoriness by the bank. There is nothing in this judgment
                    that assists SSB’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The third case cited by Mr Chua is the
                    Singapore Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Liao Eng Kiat v
                        Burswood Nominees Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 690
                        (“<em>Burswood Nominees</em>”). Although
                    the ratio of that case involved the enforceability of a foreign judgment from
                    Western Australia under RECJA in respect of a dishonoured cheque given to a
                    casino to obtain gambling chips and considerations of public policy against
                    gaming and wagering contracts under s 5(2) of the Civil Law Act
                    (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) and s 3(2)(f) of the RECJA, that judgment
                    needs to be read with some care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At [13] of the judgment, the Court of Appeal stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>Registration will not be ordered if the appellant is able
                            to establish any one of the limited number of exceptions in s 3(2)
                            of the RECJA</em>. The principal issue canvassed on appeal was
                        whether s 5(2) of the [Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed)] and
                        s 3(2)(f) of the RECJA precluded registration of the Australian
                        judgment on grounds of public policy. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A proper reading of the judgment however will show that the Court of
                    Appeal was not ruling, <em>ex cathedra</em>, on a proper
                    construction of s 3(2). The judgment went on to a careful analysis of the
                    approach a Singapore court should take. At the end of the judgment under the
                    heading ‘Conclusion’ the Court of Appeal stated (at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Whilst s 3(2) of the RECJA lays down various restrictions on
                        the court’s power to order the registration of foreign judgments,
                        s 3(1) of the RECJA gives the court the general discretion to order the
                        registration of a foreign judgment if “in all the circumstances of
                        the case [the court] thinks it is <em>just and
                            convenient</em> that the judgment should be enforced in
                        Singapore” [emphasis added]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the surface, this appears to be the same approach adopted by
                    Khoo J in <em>Perwira Ariffin Bank</em>. In its
                    judgment, the Court of Appeal stated at [39] and [40] that both the New York
                    Convention and the RECJA were enacted with the basic aim of removing
                    pre-existing obstacles to the enforcement of foreign awards or judgments and a
                    narrow reading of the public policy defence in s 3(2)(f) would help further
                    this aim and the considerations of reciprocity enjoin the courts to invoke the
                    public policy defence with caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Neither counsel raised <em>Poh
                        Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace)</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Poh Soon
                    Kiat</em>”), a later Singapore Court of Appeal decision which said
                    that <em>Burswood Nominees</em> was unsound because there
                    was no legal basis for reading a higher public policy threshold into
                    s 3(2)(f) and that its decision should be reviewed should the same issue
                    come before the Court of Appeal in the future. The Court of Appeal agreed with
                    Prof Yeo Tiong Min in his article “Statute and Public Policy in Private
                    International Law: Gambling Contracts and Foreign Judgments” (2005) SYBIL
                    133 that the decision was not defensible in light of the express words in
                    s 3(2)(f) and stated clearly at [114] that the Western Australian judgment
                    in <em>Burswood Nominees</em> could not be registered under
                    s 3(2)(f) on the ground that the judgment was based on a cause of action
                    which could not, by virtue of the public policy encapsulated in s 5(2) of
                    the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), be maintained in Singapore. The Court
                    of Appeal said, at [61], that s 3(2)(f) “<em>expressly</em> prohibits the registration of a Commonwealth judgment
                    if it was obtained ‘in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of
                    public policy … could not have been entertained by [a Singapore]
                    court.’” (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The fourth case cited by Mr Cheng was
                        <em>Westacre Investments Inc v The State-Owned Company
                        Yugoimport SDPR (also known as Jugoimport-SDPR)</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 166 (“<em>Westacre
                        Investments</em>”). However that case involved considerations
                    of what was “just and convenient” in s 3(1) in enforcing an
                    English judgment that emanated from an arbitration award published in 1994 which
                    was duly registered as a judgment in England in December 1997. An appeal
                    therefrom was dismissed in May 1999 and the House of Lords refused leave to
                    appeal. Registration of the English judgment in Singapore was only sought in
                    July 2004 when it was realised that there may be assets in Singapore. Those
                    issues do not arise here and the only principle that may be of some relevance is
                    that under s 3(1), the court must consider all the circumstances of the
                    case and should permit registration of the Commonwealth judgment only if
                    “it is just and convenient that the judgment should be enforced in
                    Singapore” (see <em>Westacre Investments</em> at
                        [20], [21] and [52]). This included, but was not limited to having
                    regard to the rights of the parties, parties’ conduct, diligence and
                    persistence of the judgment creditor in pursuing its rights, the judgment
                    debtor’s knowledge of the judgment creditor’s intentions <em>vis-á-vis</em> enforcement of the judgment and steps taken by
                    the judgment debtor to obstruct discovery of its assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statutory scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There is also a House of Lords decision that
                    was not cited by counsel, <em>viz</em>, <em>Owens Bank Ltd v Bracco and Another</em> [1992] 2 AC 443
                        (“<em>Owens Bank</em>”). This case
                    involved the enforcement of a judgment obtained by a bank against the borrower,
                    an Italian company, and the president of the Italian company in the High Court
                    of St Vincent and the Grenadines under s 9 of the Administration of Justice
                    Act 1920 (c 81) (UK) (“AJA”), which is <em>in
                        pari materia</em> with s 3 of the RECJA. The loan documents had a
                    provision giving the St Vincent court jurisdiction in the event of a dispute.
                    The president of the Italian company alleged the documents were forgeries and
                    the Italian company contended that the president had no authority to enter into
                    any such transaction. The trial judge gave judgment for CHF 9 million together
                    with interest and costs against both defendants. The St Vincent Court of Appeal
                    upheld his judgment. Proceedings were also commenced in Italy where the issue of
                    fraud was raised. The bank applied to register the St Vincent judgment in
                    England as the defendants had assets there. The issue there was different,
                        <em>viz</em>, whether in construing the
                    “fraud” exception in the equivalent to s 3(2)(d) of the
                    RECJA, the English court was entitled or bound to go into allegations of fraud
                    raised by a defendant in England when those allegations have been decided
                    against the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff in the foreign Commonwealth
                    court. The House of Lords endorsed the English Court of Appeal decisions of
                        <em>Abouloff v Oppenheimer &amp; Co</em> (1882)
                    10 QBD 295 and <em>Vadala v Lawes</em> (1890)
                    25 QBD 310, which had held that the English court was entitled and
                    bound to go into those allegations once more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     
          <em>Owens Bank</em> is of
                    interest because it explains the background to the AJA, which is equivalent to
                    our RECJA. It explains that the common law rule of finality of judgments that
                    applies to English judgments and the restrictions placed upon a party’s
                    ability to re-open the litigation, even in the case of fraud, was placed within
                    very restrictive limits, but that the common law declined to give that same
                    finality to foreign judgments preferring to give primacy to the principle that
                    fraud unravels everything (see <em>Owens Bank</em> at
                    489C–H). In the Judgments Extension Act 1868 (c 54) (UK), the United
                    Kingdom Parliament gave full reciprocal enforceability as between the judgments
                    of the different superior courts within the United Kingdom with no obstacle
                    placed in the way of registration but, by contrast, in enacting the AJA, the
                    judgment creditor seeking registration must first surmount the obstacles which s
                    9(2) of the AJA (the equivalent of s 3(2) of the RECJA) places in his way
                    and therefore denies finality by the adoption of the common law approach to
                    foreign judgments that are alleged to be obtained by fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As this is a statutory scheme, we should turn
                    to the provisions of the RECJA and O 67 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). O 67
                    envisages two stages. The first stage is an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application by the judgment creditor, supported by an
                    affidavit, for registration of the Commonwealth judgment. The ensuing
                    registration, is straightforward and usually granted, provided the almost, as it
                    were, formal requirements of O 67 r 3 of the ROC are satisfied. The
                    usual order granted must stipulate a period within which an applicant can apply
                    to set aside the registration and, importantly, that execution will not issue
                    until after the expiration of that period (see O 67 r 5(2) of the
                    ROC). This, coupled with the requirement that notice of the registration of the
                    judgment must be served on the judgment debtor with the particulars set out in
                    O 67 r 7(3) of the ROC, gives the judgment debtor notice of the
                    registration of the Commonwealth judgment in Singapore, and the opportunity, if
                    he so wishes, to apply to set aside that registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This brings us to the second stage. The
                    applicant, usually the foreign judgment debtor, is given an opportunity to apply
                    to set aside the registration. That application must also be supported by an
                    affidavit setting out the grounds upon which the applicant applies to have the
                    registration set aside (see O 67 r 9(1) of the ROC). If the court
                    hearing the setting aside application is satisfied that the judgment falls
                    within any of the cases where a judgment should not be ordered to be registered
                    under s 3(2), or that it is not just or convenient that the judgment should
                    be enforced or that there is some other sufficient reason for setting aside the
                    registration, it may order the registration of the judgment to be set aside on
                    such terms as it thinks fit (see O 67 r 9(3) of the
                ROC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     However, the provisions of the RECJA do not
                    make any distinction between the first stage and the second stage. What is the
                    statutory scheme? Section 3(2) sets out specific instances where a Commonwealth
                    judgment will not be registered. It covers instances where it is known from the
                    time of registration at the first stage that an impediment against registration
                    exists as well as those where any impediment can only be known or ascertained at
                    a later stage. Take s 3(2)(e) itself. It may well be that at the first
                    stage, the judgment creditor is unaware that the judgment debtor has filed an
                    appeal and it may equally be the case that after having obtained registration at
                    the first stage, the judgment debtor comes before the Singapore court at the
                    second stage and satisfies the court that he intends to appeal against the
                    foreign judgment. A judgment debtor may file a notice of appeal but yet not
                    proceed with the appeal at any stage. Again, a judgment creditor may not know
                    that the public policy of Singapore will not allow the enforcement of his
                    Commonwealth judgment. Whether the enforcement of a Commonwealth judgment is
                    contrary to the public policy of Singapore may be a contentious issue. In this
                    context it will be noted that the Court of Appeal made observations in December
                    2009 in <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em> which were contrary to the
                    earlier Court of Appeal decision in <em>Burswood
                        Nominees</em> in October 2004. The same goes for arguments on
                    jurisdiction under s 3(2)(a). It is not always easy to ascertain if
                    s 3(2)(a) is satisfied until it is authoritatively adjudicated by a court
                    of competent jurisdiction. In practice, such grounds are only raised at the
                    second stage when the judgment debtor comes forward to set aside the
                    registration. Section 3(1) gives an overarching discretion. Even if none of the
                    specific instances in s 3(2) apply, a Singapore court may still refuse to
                    enforce an otherwise registrable Commonwealth judgment if, in its view, it was
                    in all the circumstances of the case not just and convenient to do so. This is
                    consistent with the statements cited from previous judgments (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> and <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is only when we turn to O 67 of the
                    ROC that we find the provision of the two stage process. These are procedural
                    rules. They were made for the orderly, efficient and convenient disposal of
                    legal processes brought before our courts. They can be amended by the Rules
                    Committee and with the approval of the Chief Justice (see s 80(5) of the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). Finality
                    to the first stage comes early when the debtor fails to challenge the
                    registration. This usually happens when there is no defence and especially where
                    the defendant is insolvent. There is no need to proceed to the second stage and
                    the registration becomes final.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I therefore cannot accept Mr Fan’s
                    argument that since an appeal was extant at the time SSB applied for
                    registration at the first stage, there was a fatal flaw in the registration
                    granted on 18 February 2011 as that Malaysian judgment was incapable of
                    registration at the first stage. If that is correct then it must follow that a
                    foreign judgment is incapable of registration at the first stage if, unknown to
                    the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor <em>intends</em>
                    to but has not yet appealed. What if the judgment debtor yet later on abandons
                    his appeal before it is heard? In <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P
                    Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 67/9/1, it is
                    stated, correctly, that although a judgment has been registered, its status is
                    still challengeable and “[t]he party against whom the registered judgment
                    may be enforced is at liberty to apply to have it set
                aside.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I should also mention two old cases which
                    support my view of the statutory scheme. Neither counsel brought these cases to
                    my attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first is <em>In The Matter
                        Of Enactment No 10 Of 1922, The Judgments (Reciprocity) Enactment; Ho Hong
                        Bank Ltd v Ho Kai Neo &amp; Anor</em> [1932] MLJ 76
                        (“<em>Ho Kai Neo</em>”). The plaintiff
                    had applied <em>ex parte</em> for leave to register a
                    Singapore judgment in Johore under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments
                    Enactment (Enactment No 2 of 1922) (FMS) (“the Enactment”).
                    Thorne J, in the court below had refused registration at the <em>ex parte</em> stage because he took the view that default
                    judgments were not registrable under s 3(2)(c) of the Enactment, which is
                        <em>in pari materia</em> to s 3(2)(c) of the
                    RECJA. On appeal, Sproule and Terrell JJ were of the view that the
                    registration should have been allowed as a matter of course and that, in any
                    case, the interpretation of the court below of s 3(2)(c) of the Enactment
                    was wrong. Sproule J’s judgment at pages 76 and 80 are
                    relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, a judgment holder is entitled under the Enactment and Rules to
                        his provisional order <em>as a matter of course, and an onus
                            is cast upon the debtor to assail registration later, he having already
                            suffered judgment in the original Court</em>. In our case the
                        burden was in fact thrown upon the judgment creditor, instead, to support
                        his judgment and not as against his debtor, but against the Court. With
                        great respect, I do not think the Court would be justified in so acting
                        except in some such extreme case as that the foreign judgment was so
                        manifestly incompetent as to render the application on the face of it an
                        abuse of the process of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion, therefore, the order appealed from was wrong. An order nisi
                        for provisional registration should have been granted as of course.
                            <em>Section 3(2) applies to final registration,
                            thereafter, giving the judgment debtor certain restricted grounds upon
                            which he could assail the competence or correctness of the Judgment of
                            the Supreme Court of the Colony in avoidance of final registration.
                            These were not the concern of the Johore Court upon the original ex
                            parte application for provisional registration</em>. But even
                        if they were, then the learned Judge in the Court below was wrong in his
                        construction of s 3(2) in general or its cl (c) in particular; and if
                        indeed he relied upon any theory of non-finality of a judgment by default,
                        then he was again wrong.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Lam Soon Cannery Co v H
                        W Hooper &amp; Co</em> [1965] MLJ 135 (“<em>Lam Soon Cannery</em>”), one of the arguments raised
                    at the application to set aside (<em>ie</em>, the <em>inter partes</em> stage) was that the original court had
                    acted without jurisdiction. Counsel argued that Sproule J in <em>Ho Kai Neo</em> was wrong. A V Winslow J
                    disagreed, stating at 136-137):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An application for provisional registration is, under the relevant rules,
                        made <em>ex parte</em> before a judge of the High Court
                        in chambers. I do not think that any judge would make an order as a matter
                        of course having regard to the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 3
                        which impose restrictions on such registration. In fact the Rules made under
                        the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Ordinance (GN No 122 of 1938) make
                        special provision for the procedure to be adopted on such applications which
                        must be supported by an affidavit of the facts. I do not think that
                        Sproule J intended to exclude the exercise of discretion by the judge
                        because, after stating that the judgment holder is entitled to a provisional
                        order as a matter of course, and that the onus is cast upon the debtor to
                        assail registration later, he continues, "In our case the burden was in fact
                        thrown upon the judgment creditor, instead, to support his judgment and not
                        as against his debtor, but against the court. With great respect, I do not
                        think the court would be justified in so acting except in some such extreme
                        case as that the foreign judgment was so manifestly incompetent as to render
                        the application on the face of it an abuse of the process of the court." In
                        this last sentence Sproule J, according to my understanding of what he
                        says, exemplifies the kind of application for provisional registration which
                        it would not be just and convenient to grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In my opinion, on an ex parte application, supported by
                            an affidavit, which ex facie satisfies the requirements of the Ordinance
                            and the Rules, the judge who has no other materials before him, will be
                            hard put to it to decide that it would not be just and convenient to
                            enforce the judgment in the State in the absence of grounds which are
                            also apparent from the record before him. This he can only do in some
                            such extreme case as Sproule J has described or where it would
                            appear to be inconvenient to enforce the judgment here on the ground,
                            for example, that the debtor has no assets within the local
                            jurisdiction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Winslow J’s judgment was allowed on appeal (see
                        <em>Lam Soon Cannery Co v Hooper &amp; Co</em>
                    [1965–1967] SLR(R) 149) on other grounds, the above portion of
                    Winslow J’s judgment was not, however, disturbed. In fact, the Court of
                    Appeal supported Winslow J’s reasoning (at [34]–[36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    Rule 9(1), as it stands, plainly takes no account
                            of the one side of the coin, while looking only at the other, with the
                            result that the rule has rendered the provisions of s 3(1)
                            nugatory. <em>Registration being ex parte, and
                                consequently a matter of course, it was at that stage manifestly
                                premature to anticipate and consider whether or not the judgment
                                debtor might be able to show grounds against enforcement of the
                                judgment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    As Winslow J puts it: “In my opinion,
                            on an <em>ex parte</em> application, supported by
                            an affidavit, which <em>ex facie</em> satisfies the
                            requirements of the Ordinance and the rules, the judge who has no other
                            material before him, will be hard put to it to decide that it would not
                            be just and convenient to enforce the judgment in the State, in the
                            absence of grounds which are also apparent from the record before
                            him.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    
              <em>Logically the time for the
                                judgment debtor to show cause why enforcement would not be just or
                                convenient is when he applies for the registration to be set
                                aside</em>. That is the practice in England and it was the
                            practice in Singapore until the former r 12 ceased to be in force.
                            Can a rule be valid which is in conflict with the law contained in the
                            statute under which the rule itself came to be made? The law on this
                            point is clear. Section 23(c) of the Interpretation and General Clauses
                            Ordinance (Cap 2) provides that “no subsidiary legislation made
                            under an Ordinance shall be inconsistent with the provisions of any
                            Ordinance.” In my view r 9(1) so offends. The rule cannot
                            have the effect of denying to the judge the discretion vested in him by
                            sub-s (1) of s 3. To that extent I hold that r 9(1) is ultra
                            vires and should be read in the sense one understands the former
                            r 12 to mean.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both cases support my views of the statutory scheme and the two stage
                    process laid down in O 67. In so saying, I am not advocating the view that
                    a court can never refuse registration at the first stage. Ordinarily, if the
                    judgment creditor knows that an appeal has been filed, he should not make an
                    application at the first stage. Also there may well be cases where it is so
                    clear that registration will be refused at the first stage. It all depends on
                    the circumstances of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I now turn to another point. O 67
                    r 3 of the ROC sets out the various requirements of the supporting
                    affidavit. Under r 3(1)(c)(iii) there is a requirement for a statement that
                    to the best of the deponent’s information and belief, the judgment sought
                    to be registered does not fall within any of the categories listed in
                    s 3(2) of the RECJA. There is a rule applicable to all <em>ex parte</em> applications, and O 67 r 3 is no exception,
                    that the applicant has a duty to make full and frank disclosure (see <em>The “Vasiliy Golovnin”</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 994 (“<em>Vasiliy
                    Golovnin</em>”) at [83]–[93] (in the context of an
                    application for a warrant of arrest in admiralty proceedings) and <em>Bahtera Offshore (M) Sdn Bhd v Sim Kok Beng and another</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 365 at [18]–[33] (in the context of a <em>Mareva</em> injunction)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I note that one Andrew John Newton Lee
                    (“Mr Andrew Lee”) had affirmed an affidavit on behalf of SSB on
                    17 February 2010 where he had deposed, at [14], that the Malaysian judgment, if registered in the High
                    Court of Singapore, will not be liable to be set aside with respect to the said
                    registration under s 3(2) of the RECJA as the same does not fall within any
                    of the cases mentioned in s 3(2) of the RECJA when in fact, about 5 months
                    earlier, MDS and RT had filed their appeals against the Malaysia
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, I am satisfied that on balance, this
                    was not a deliberate statement made to mislead the court; it was probably due to
                    some miscommunication. The fact that the appeals had been filed was not
                    something that was or could be hidden. No one raised this allegation below. RT
                    has not suffered any prejudice. Furthermore, the first objections raised by RT
                    in his affidavit sworn on 7 April 2010 was that (i) he was not duly served
                    with the process of the original court, (ii) there was no such action as
                    described by SSB, <em>viz</em>, Civil Suit No. D7
                    (D9)(d1)-22-888-2200 in the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur and (iii) the
                    foreign judgment does not exist. What had happened was a typographical error:
                    the last four digits of the Malaysian judgment should have read
                    “2000” and not “2200”. It was only in his 27 April
                    2010 affidavit that RT deposed that he had filed an appeal on 15 September 2009.
                    By this time RT had been made a bankrupt in Malaysia. SSB also applied and was
                    granted an order to correct the reference to the Malaysian suit to read as
                    “Civil Suit No. D7 (D9)(d1)-22-888-2000”. There were then
                    long delays to the continued hearing of these proceedings whilst RT obtained
                    sanction of the Official Assignee of Malaysia to continue with this application.
                    The matter was only heard below on the merits on 17 June 2011. RT does not
                    appear to have raised any arguments based on authorities such as <em>Vasiliy Golovin</em> below (see written submissions dated
                    30 March 2011 and the learned AR’s Notes of Evidence). It was only in
                    RT’s written submissions filed on 14 July 2011 for this appeal that
                    RT alleged SSB “misled” the court by Mr Andrew Lee’s
                    affidavit but this point was not pursued before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     RT’s last avenue for an appeal, an
                    application for leave to appeal to the Malaysian Federal Court, was dismissed on
                    14 June 2011. By 17 June 2011, the date when the learned AR dismissed
                    RT’s application, all avenues of appeal had been exhausted by RT.
                    SSB’s claim against RT is on his guarantee against default and non-payment
                    of facilities granted by SSB (UMF) to MDS. The vast majority of such claims are
                    straightforward and given on a summary basis, as was this judgment. It is
                    unsurprising that the learned AR below dismissed RT’s application to set
                    aside the registration of the Malaysian judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Even if Mr Fan’s contention is
                    correct, and I do not, with respect, believe it is, there is no utility or
                    practical consideration that requires the setting aside of the registration just
                    for SSB to apply once more to register the Malaysian judgment. Such over
                    emphasis on technicalities no longer has any place in modern civil procedure.
                    Khoo J’s approach in <em>Perwira Ariffin Bank</em>,
                    in which he stayed the setting aside proceedings pending the outcome of an
                    appeal, has everything to recommend it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In all the circumstances of this case, it was
                    just and convenient to register and enforce this Malaysian judgment in
                    Singapore. I therefore dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at $1,500 all
                    in.</p>
