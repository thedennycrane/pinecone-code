<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Disputes over maintenance and division of
                    matrimonial property are common incidents arising from dissolution of marriages.
                    In the present case, the dispute over maintenance has been particularly
                    acrimonious. It has undergone several rounds before no less than three District
                    Court Judges and several appeals to the High Court. Furthermore, the husband
                    claimed that his mother’s loan to purchase the matrimonial home should be
                    treated as his direct financial contribution for the division of matrimonial
                    assets, in addition to deducting it at source from the gross sale proceeds to be
                    refunded to his mother. In either event, the mother’s loan would be repaid
                    but if the husband’s position was accepted, it would have increased his
                    share of the net sale proceeds and would also entail double counting of the
                    mother’s loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties were married on 20 May 1995,
                    and have two children (ages 9 and 12). The husband is 42 years old and is a
                    captain with a reputable airline. The wife is 43 years old, and is a part-time
                    customer service engineer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In July 2005, the wife confronted the husband on
                    the issue of his suspected infidelity. In September 2005, he moved out of the
                    matrimonial home at xxx (“the matrimonial property”) to live with
                    his mother, before returning in November 2006. In February 2007, the wife filed
                    for divorce. After a contested trial, the wife was granted a decree nisi on
                    28 December 2009 on the ground of the husband’s unreasonable
                    behaviour (in particular, his improper association with a third party), while
                    the husband’s counterclaim against the wife was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Earlier, pursuant to the wife’s
                    application for interim maintenance in Maintenance Summons No 5941 of 2005, the
                    parties had entered into Maintenance Order No 1168 of 2005 by consent on
                    8 November 2005, the terms of which were as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The husband was to pay the wife monthly
                            maintenance of $4,500 for maintenance of the wife and the two children
                            from 1 October 2005 to 1 December 2005;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thereafter, the husband was to pay –</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">$4,800 per month for the period of 12
                                    months from 1 January 2006;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">$5,100 per month for the period of 12
                                    months from 1 January 2007;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">$5,400 per month for the period of 12
                                    months from 1 January 2008;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">$5,700 per month for the period of 12
                                    months from 1 January 2009; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The husband was to pay $6,000 per month from
                            1 January 2010 onwards.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The husband subsequently applied to vary this
                    maintenance order downwards in Maintenance Summons No 7419 of 2006
                    (“Maintenance Summons No 7419/2006”), while the wife applied
                    to vary it upwards and to enforce outstanding arrears in Maintenance Summons
                    Nos 5549 and 5500 of 2007 respectively (“Maintenance Summons Nos
                    5549/2007 and 5550/2007”). On 16 May 2006, District Judge Sowaran
                    Singh (“DJ Sowaran Singh”) dismissed both applications to vary the
                    maintenance order, but held that the husband was at liberty to re-apply for a
                    downward adjustment in the event that his total income was substantially reduced
                    (by at least $500) or in the event that the wife’s take-home salary
                    increased substantially (by at least $400). Arrears of maintenance amounting to
                    $24,408.10 were ordered to be paid in monthly instalments until the entire sum
                    was paid up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In District Court Appeal No 19 of 2008, the
                    husband appealed against the orders in Maintenance Summons Nos 7419/2006 and
                    5550/2007. Various grounds were raised by the husband including
                    misrepresentation by the wife that she had ceased working or would be ceasing
                    work even though she continued to work part-time, as well as matters relating to
                    the true state of each party’s expenses. On 4 December 2008, Chao
                    Hick Tin JA granted a downward variation with a monthly reduction of $1,000
                    backdated to January 2007, and ordered that the wife was to pay the husband the
                    over-payment of $1,000 per month from January 2007 to November 2008 amounting to
                    $23,000 in total. In <em>XZ v YA</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 51 (“<em>XZ v
                    YA</em>”) at [23], Chao JA
                    stated that the reduction was on account of the misrepresentation of the wife as
                    regards her employment status prior to the entering of the consent maintenance
                    order. In the result, the monthly maintenance was reduced as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$4,100 per month for the period of 12 months from
                            1 January 2007;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$4,400 per month for the period of 12 months from
                            1 January 2008;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$4,700 per month for the period of 12 months from
                            1 January 2009; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$5,000 per month from 1 January 2010
                            onwards.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In Maintenance Summons Nos 5819 and 6388 of 2009
                    respectively, both the wife and the husband again applied to vary the interim
                    maintenance order. On 30 August 2010, District Judge Amy Tung Chew Ming
                    (“DJ Amy Tung”) granted a downward variation such that the husband
                    was to pay the wife $4,000 per month with effect from 1 January 2010. DJ
                    Amy Tung also ordered that the husband was to pay the wife the arrears of
                    $14,395 in instalments of $200 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Both parties appealed but subsequently agreed to
                    withdraw their respective appeals in the High Court against the interim orders
                    made by DJ Amy Tung in deference to the final orders to be made in the
                    ancillary matters. For this reason, DJ Amy Tung did not record in writing her
                    decision to vary the maintenance order. On 30 November 2010, various
                    ancillary orders were made by District Judge Jen Koh (“the DJ”).
                    On 13 December 2010, the husband filed the present appeal against the
                    orders in respect of access, maintenance and the division of the matrimonial
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I heard the appeal over two days on 26 May
                    and 23 August 2011, and on 6 September 2011 I delivered my brief oral
                    grounds where I substantially dismissed the appeal. The appeal against the
                    division of matrimonial property was dismissed while the maintenance order was
                    varied primarily due to a change in circumstances arising from the recent
                    purchase of an HDB flat by the wife. Variations to the access time for the
                    children were made principally by consent. The husband was ordered to pay costs
                    fixed at $2,000 inclusive of disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As the husband is appealing to the Court of
                    Appeal against my orders on division of matrimonial assets, maintenance and
                    costs, I now set out the reasons for my decision in respect of these orders. He
                    has not appealed against the orders for access to the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The ancillary orders pertaining to maintenance
                    and the division of matrimonial assets made by the DJ on 30 November 2010
                    were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With respect to division, the DJ assessed the
                    husband’s and the wife’s direct financial contributions towards the
                    matrimonial property to be 61.2 percent and 38.8 percent respectively. After
                    considering all circumstances of the case including the wife’s
                    contributions to the husband in his career, her contributions to the welfare of
                    the family, the conduct of the husband, the wife’s care of the children,
                    both parties’ indirect contributions to the household expenses and the
                    length of the marriage, the DJ ordered an equal division of the net sale
                    proceeds of the matrimonial property after repayment of the bank loan, the
                    husband’s mother’s loan, and the costs and expenses of the
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With respect to maintenance, the DJ found that
                    the husband had an average total income of $17,886.31 per month (from all
                    sources). As such, his financial situation had improved substantially since
                    2007/2008 when the order for $5,000 per month was made by Chao JA, and thus
                    there was no merit in the husband’s application to vary the maintenance
                    for each child downwards to $1,000 per month. Further, the DJ found, after
                    taking into consideration the wife’s income and expenses, that she would
                    have a shortfall of about $5,000 per month, which reinforced the appropriateness
                    of the maintenance order in that quantum.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The DJ rejected the husband’s assertion that his mother’s
                    loan of $305,000 should be included as part of his direct financial
                    contributions. As this sum was to be repaid to his mother from the sale proceeds
                    (and has since been repaid), its inclusion in the calculation of direct
                    financial contributions would lead to double-counting. In any case, the sum was
                    intended by the husband’s mother as a loan, and not an
                investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the issue of indirect contributions, the DJ
                    found that the marriage subsisted for 12 years, and rejected the husband’s
                    contention that the wife’s contributions towards him and the marriage
                    should be confined to 7.75 years by excluding the period when they did not live
                    together when the husband was undergoing training in Perth, Australia (12
                    months) and when he was training and staying at xxx (11 months), as well as the
                    period when the parties stayed with his parents (15 months). During those
                    periods, it could not be said that their marriage was suspended and that they
                    were no longer married, or that they failed to do their part in contributing
                    towards the family. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The following indirect contributions over the
                    length of the marriage were pleaded by the wife:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Paying for the family expenses when
                        the husband was studying to become a pilot.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Taking care of the children, maintaining the
                        home and looking after the welfare of the family especially when the husband
                        was away from Singapore for15 to 17 days each month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Contributing more financially towards
                        the first matrimonial property which was an HDB flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Holding the family together and
                        looking after the children when the husband walked out on them for one and a
                        half years while he was involved with another woman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having considered these factors as well as all the circumstances of the case,
                    the DJ apportioned a <em>further</em> 11.2 percent of the
                    matrimonial property to the wife for her indirect contributions, such that the
                    parties each received an equal share of the net sale proceeds after repayment of
                    the bank loan, the husband’s mother’s loan and the costs and
                    expenses of the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Before me, it was not suggested by the husband
                    that the DJ was wrong in assessing the indirect contributions of the parties.
                    Instead, counsel for the husband only advanced two arguments that the DJ had
                    erred in her apportionment:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the husband’s
                        mother’s loan should be included as part of the husband’s direct
                        financial contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the DJ’s apportionment had overlooked a
                        consent order recorded by DJ Sowaran Singh dated 6 April 2010
                        (“the Consent Order”), wherein the parties had agreed to the
                        apportionment of net sale proceeds <em>after</em> the
                        repayment of the bank loan, the husband’s mother’s loan
                            <em>and the refund of CPF
                        contributions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">As such, the husband sought the refund
                        of CPF contributions <em>before</em> apportionment
                        (such that the net sale proceeds to be apportioned would amount to only
                        $151,297.91) and an upward adjustment of his share of the net sale proceeds
                        to 70 percent on the basis of his increased direct financial
                        contribution (taking his mother’s loan into
                account).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Treatment of the mother’s loan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I agreed with the DJ that the husband’s
                    mother’s loan should not be treated as the husband’s direct
                    financial contribution. This was a loan to both the husband and wife to purchase
                    the matrimonial property. While it is true that the husband’s mother
                    extended the loan because the husband is her son, it is equally true that it was
                    extended to enable both the husband and the wife to <em>jointly</em> purchase the matrimonial property. After all, the
                    property was registered in their joint names. This became even clearer given
                    that the loan has since been fully repaid to the husband’s mother from the
                    sale proceeds of the matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I have also noted that in the husband’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on
                    1 February 2010, he had averred that the mother’s loan was to be
                    repaid first before apportionment and, more significantly, had not listed his
                    mother’s loan as part of his direct financial contributions. Furthermore,
                    there was no suggestion by the husband in his 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means that he had paid any interest to his mother or
                    that the loan attracted any interest payment. Instead he had simply alleged that
                    the repayment of the mother’s loan should include interest at 2.5 percent
                    being “opportunity costs of the fixed deposits [<em>sic</em>] interest”. Significantly, the mother was not listed
                    as a creditor of the husband under the section “Particulars of my
                    Creditors (i.e. people whom I owe money to)”. In his
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on
                    29 April 2010, the husband adopted a contrary position and claimed that the
                    mother’s loan was a personal loan to him and as such it should count as
                    part of his direct financial contribution. On the other hand, in the
                    wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means, she
                    maintained that part of the purchase price for the matrimonial property came
                    from an interest-free loan from the husband’s mother. I should add that in
                    her 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on
                    19 August 2010, she claimed that the loan was a gift from the
                    husband’s mother to both of them but did not wish to deprive her of
                    repayment though there was never any agreement on interest. It was curious that
                    no affidavit was filed by the “lender”, <em>ie</em>, the husband’s mother, to depose that the loan was
                    personal to the husband, that there was an agreement on interest or that the
                    husband had paid interest to her. Based on the objective evidence before me, it
                    was clear that the mother’s loan was to both the husband and the wife to
                    enable them to purchase the matrimonial property jointly. In the circumstances,
                    the husband’s case that the mother’s loan was personal to him was,
                    in my view, an afterthought which was contrived to increase his share of the
                    sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In any event, the approach of refunding the
                    mother’s loan before apportionment <em>and</em>
                    including the loan as part of the husband’s direct financial contribution
                    for the purposes of apportionment, as proposed by the husband, would have
                    resulted in double counting of the mother’s loan to the detriment of the
                    wife. Should the loan of $305,000 be included in the husband’s direct
                    financial contribution, the ratio of direct financial contributions would shift
                    from 38.8 percent : 61.2 percent to 23.8 percent : 76.2 percent in favour of the
                    husband. Making the same adjustment for indirect contributions as was done by
                    the DJ, the apportionment ratio would be about 35 percent : 65 percent, instead
                    of equal apportionment, in favour of the husband. This implies that the husband
                    would receive $403,879.86, out of the net sale proceeds of $621,353.63,
                        <em>in addition to</em> the refund of $305,000 to his
                    mother. On the other hand, the wife would receive only $217,473.77, as opposed
                    to the $310,676.81 that she would receive under the present orders. As such, it
                    may be observed that double counting of the mother’s loan would
                    unjustifiably re-allocate close to $100,000 from the wife to the
                husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Consent Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before DJ Sowaran Singh, the parties had
                    recorded the Consent Order to sell the matrimonial property and for the sale
                    proceeds to be dealt with on the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The Parties are to sell [the matrimonial property]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  Repayment of [husband’s] loan of
                            $305,000.00 from the [husband’s] parents… to the [husband].
                            The [wife] confirms that this sum be returned to the [wife’s]
                            parents regardless of any other orders that may be made at the ancillary
                            hearing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv)  Agent’s fees;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(v)    Solicitors’ legal costs and disbursements
                            and incidentals in connection with the sale of the [matrimonial
                            property];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(vi)  The costs of the divorce proceedings of
                            $15,000.00, disbursements and costs of the private investigators’
                            reports (as per receipt);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(vii) Each of the parties’ solicitors (or a
                            solicitor nominated by the party) shall keep half of the balance
                            proceeds as stakeholders pending the final determination of the divorce
                            ancillary matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    This Consent Order shall not prejudice the
                            [husband’s] right to claim interest on the loan of $305,000.00
                            which the [husband] borrowed from his parents or the positions of both
                            parties on the division of the proceeds of the [matrimonial
                            property].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)    The parties are entitled to use the sum that has
                            been reimbursed to their CPF accounts under paragraph 3(ii) for the
                            purchase of any property and both parties confirm that they will not
                            claim any share of such property that the other party may
                            purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)    For the avoidance of doubt, this Order is made to
                            facilitate the sale of the [matrimonial property] and the return of the
                            $305,000.00 to the [husband’s] parents pending division of the
                            Court of the [matrimonial property] in the ancillary
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This Consent Order was not made pursuant to any application by the
                    parties and the circumstances under which it arose were unclear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>Smith Brian Walker v Foo
                        Moo Chye Julie</em> [2009] SGHC 247 at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>, I observed that “there is no hard and
                    fast rule whether the sale proceeds should be divided at source or after
                    repayment of the parties’ respective CPF accounts”. On that
                    occasion, the District Judge had ordered the division of the sale proceeds of
                    the matrimonial home at source and not after reimbursement of their
                    CPF accounts with the result that the wife’s share of the sale
                    proceeds was insufficient to fully refund her CPF account. Under those
                    circumstances, I allowed the appeal and ordered the sale proceeds to be
                    apportioned <em>after</em> reimbursement of the respective
                    parties’ CPF contributions in order to achieve a fair and equitable
                    distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, no such argument was
                    raised by either party. Instead the husband’s case was that under the
                    terms of the Consent Order, the parties had <em>agreed</em>
                    that the sale proceeds should be applied in a specific order, in particular,
                    that the apportionment of the balance net sale proceeds should be done <em>after</em> repayment of the bank loan, the husband’s
                    mother’s loan <em>and</em> refund of the
                    parties’ respective CPF contributions. However, the DJ, at
                    paras 62–63 of her Grounds of Decision (“the GD”), had
                    instead awarded an equal apportionment of the net sale proceeds after repayment
                    of the bank loan and the husband’s mother’s loan, and directed the
                    parties to use their equal net sale proceeds to refund their respective CPF
                    contributions. In doing so, the husband submitted that the DJ had reversed the
                    order in relation to the refund of CPF contributions as recorded in the Consent
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The rationale for the husband’s argument
                    for the refund of the parties’ respective CPF contributions prior to
                    apportionment was obvious – this would effectively grant him a larger
                    share of the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial property. At the point of
                    completion of sale, the total CPF contributions from both parties amounted to
                    $470,055.72. The refund of this amount prior to apportionment would necessarily
                    imply that about three-quarters of the net sale proceeds (<em>ie</em>, $621,353.63) would be excluded from the process of
                    apportionment, and thus the relative indirect contributions of the parties
                    (which was in favour of the wife) would only be reflected in the apportionment
                    of the remaining $151,297.91.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In my view, the Consent Order by DJ Sowaran
                    Singh was made to facilitate the sale of the matrimonial property and for
                    repayment of the husband’s mother’s loan (see para 5(8) of the
                    Consent Order). Further it was specifically recorded in para 5(3)(vii) of
                    the Consent Order that the balance sale proceeds shall be kept by the
                    parties’ solicitors pending final determination of the ancillary matters.
                    It was therefore merely an interim arrangement and was not intended to bind both
                    parties for the purpose of division of the matrimonial property on the specific
                    order for the application of the sale proceeds. There was also no question of
                    issue estoppel either since neither party addressed this issue before DJ Sowaran
                    Singh or before me for that matter. Further, the husband evidently did not treat
                    the Consent Order as having such an effect since this argument was not even
                    raised before the DJ in the court below. This was yet another afterthought that
                    was raised belatedly to increase the husband’s share of the sale
                    proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In any case, I was of the opinion that the
                    approach of refunding CPF contributions prior to apportionment would lead
                    to an inequitable outcome in the present case. In effect, the husband’s
                    submission would also entail some form of double counting of his CPF
                    contributions. The DJ in arriving at her decision that the husband’s
                    direct contribution was 61.2 percent had factored in his CPF contributions. If
                    his argument was accepted, it would result in reducing the net sale proceeds
                    from $621,353.63 to $151,297.91. This would in turn have a negative effect on
                    the value of the wife’s additional indirect contributions (over and above
                    those of the husband’s) which was found to be 11.2 percent of the value of
                    the net sale proceeds. Under the present order, the monetary value of her
                    additional indirect contributions would be 11.2 percent of $621,353.63,
                        <em>ie</em>, $69,591.61 whereas under the
                    husband’s computation, it would be drastically reduced to $16,945.37 (11.2
                    percent of $151,297.91). This would result in an inequitable recognition of the
                    wife’s indirect contributions and would thus be inconsistent with the need
                    to give full credit and value to indirect contributions, as stated in <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at
                        [34].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Accordingly, I ordered that the division of
                    the matrimonial property made by the DJ below was to stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before examining the reasons for my decision
                    on the maintenance, it is necessary to briefly recount the history of the
                    parties’ disputes over the quantum of the maintenance. By consent, the
                    husband had previously agreed to interim maintenance for the wife and children
                    ranging from $4,500 to $6,000. It has since undergone two variations eventually
                    resulting in the DJ ordering monthly maintenance of $5,000. I reduced it to
                    $3,500 due to a change in the circumstances as explained below. The amount
                    ordered by me is the lowest of all the previous maintenance orders made and is
                    $1,500 more than what the husband claimed to be the fair monthly maintenance for
                    both the wife and the children. There was no cross appeal by the
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The husband is a pilot of a reputable
                    international airline. When the application was heard by the DJ, his monthly
                    salary was at least $12,000. Since then, he was promoted to the position of
                    captain with effect from August 2010. The husband did not produce the updated
                    salary after his promotion but it is likely to be higher than $12,000 per month.
                    The husband also disputed the DJ’s assessment of his average monthly
                    income from all sources (including salary, bonuses and income from personal
                    investment activities) as $17,886.31. During the hearing before me, much time
                    was unnecessarily spent in determining the exact current salary of the husband.
                    Ultimately, the exact current salary was not critical as the ability of the
                    husband to pay the maintenance whether it was $2,000 (as proposed by the
                    husband) or $5,000 (as claimed by the wife) was really not in issue based on
                    either his previous salary or his current salary as a captain. This was borne
                    out by the undeniable fact that he had previously agreed to a higher interim
                    maintenance ranging from $4,500 to $6,000 (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) above) or even the reduced maintenance ordered by Chao JA
                    (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) after taking into account the
                    wife’s part-time employment. On the other hand, the wife works part-time
                    as a customer service engineer and has a monthly take-home pay of $1,999 (or
                    $2,165 after taking into account pro-rated bonuses).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the court below, the DJ assessed the
                    wife’s expenses as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The rental of the apartment was deducted from
                    the list of expenses as the DJ held that the wife was to be solely responsible
                    for this item to be paid with her part-time salary. As such, the DJ found that
                    the wife would have a monthly shortfall of $5,144.82 (based on her basic salary
                    of $1,999) or $4,859.82 (based on her gross salary of $2,165). This was rounded
                    to $5,000 per month, which coincided with the amount of maintenance ordered in
                    view of the husband’s financial resources and income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In this appeal, the husband argued that the
                    maintenance for the two children should be reduced from $2,000 each to $1,000
                    and that no maintenance should be ordered for the wife, such that the total
                    maintenance should be $2,000 and not $5,000. The grounds were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     There were several unjustified
                        expenses in the wife’s list of expenses, including insurance expenses,
                        expenses for the maid and the children’s tuition
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     The wife had
                        sufficient CPF funds to purchase a small HDB flat, which would free up
                        rental expenses and enable her to contribute towards the expenses of the
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        wife should not receive maintenance as the parties had the same educational
                        qualifications (<em>ie</em>, a diploma) and the wife
                        deliberately took on part-time, instead of full-time, work to halve her
                        income.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        children’s maintenance was excessive as the children are ordinary
                        primary school children in local schools with school fees of only $5.50 per
                        month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I agreed with the husband’s counsel that
                    the following expenses should be deducted for the purpose of determining the
                    maintenance:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     Personal expenses of the wife
                        – the insurance premium of $541.27 for the wife’s personal
                        insurance which was paid by the wife even prior to the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Daughter’s expenses – the insurance premium of $205.70 for a
                        policy which has already lapsed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Taking into account
                    these two deductions, the total remaining expenses would be
                $4,397.85.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Further, at the hearing on 23 August
                    2011, the wife confirmed that she has since purchased an HDB flat which is
                    scheduled for completion in December 2011. Upon completion, this would have the
                    effect of freeing up the rental expenses of $1,880 which the wife is currently
                    paying with her monthly part-time salary. It should be remembered that in
                    arriving at the revised expenses of $4,397.85, the current rental of $1,880 was
                    not included. However, with the purchase of the HDB flat, the wife would be able
                    to use her current salary to provide for herself and to contribute towards the
                    maintenance of the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Arising from the recent purchase of the HDB
                    flat, the wife through her counsel informed the court that she would be required
                    to top up monthly repayments in cash of $300 for the HDB flat and that she is
                    likely to incur renovation expenses of about $30,000 to be funded by a bank
                    loan. Although the additional information was not stated by way of an affidavit,
                    no objection was raised by the husband’s counsel during the hearing. Had
                    it been raised, I would have directed the wife to file a supporting affidavit.
                    In any event, the additional information appeared both fair and reasonable to
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The husband also submitted that if the wife
                    would like to have the benefit of a full-time maid, she should return to
                    full-time employment. In <em>BF v BG</em>
                    [2006] SGHC 197, Woo Bih Li J found that although it was not in the
                    interest of the children for the wife to return to full-time employment, she
                    could have taken on part-time work given her qualifications and experience. Woo
                    J then notionally ascribed a monthly salary of $1,000 as the amount which the
                    wife could reasonably have earned from her part-time employment. The decision
                    was affirmed by the Court of Appeal – see <em>BG v
                        BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [80].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, the wife is working
                    part-time drawing a monthly salary of $2,165 (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) and is contributing to the expenses. Similarly, the
                    wife submitted that a full-time job would not be realistic or desirable as the
                    two children were very young (ages 9 and 12) and she did not have the benefit of
                    assistance from her parents since both of them have already passed away.
                    Further, she added that as the husband is frequently overseas (due to the nature
                    of his occupation), it was not reasonable for her to resume full-time employment
                    as the children required constant parental attention at this stage of their
                    lives. I therefore did not accept the husband’s submission that the wife
                    should return to full-time employment to provide more financial contribution
                    towards the household expenses. In any event, the wife has been working
                    part-time since January 2006 prior to the dissolution of the marriage. Having
                    said that, when the children are older the wife should consider resuming
                    full-time employment, at which time, it would be appropriate for the husband to
                    apply to vary the maintenance order taking into account the full-time earning
                    capacity of the wife as well as the cost of living then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On the evidence before me, I was satisfied
                    that, contrary to the husband’s assertion, the wife was not deliberately
                    working part-time to halve her monthly income in order to enhance her
                    maintenance claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Given that she has now acquired an HDB flat
                    and is required to pay for her own insurance premiums as well as to pay the
                    monthly top up amount of $300 for the HDB flat, I found that she should be able
                    to contribute about $1,500 towards the revised expenses which would have
                    included the expenses for the maid in any event. This was in fact consistent
                    with the argument raised by the husband’s counsel in [34(b)] above as well
                    as para 12 of the GD by the DJ wherein she stated that the husband was at
                    liberty to apply for variation when the wife acquired a property of her own. In
                    this regard, it is material to highlight that Chao JA in <em>XZ v
                        YA</em> at [23] had reduced
                    the maintenance by only $1,000 even though the effect of the wife’s
                    misrepresentation had concealed her then part-time salary of $1,831. He found
                    that it “would not be fair to reduce the monthly maintenance by the
                    entire amount”. Similarly in the present case, I did not think it was
                    fair or appropriate to reduce the monthly maintenance by the entire rental
                    payment of $1,880 as both parties should benefit from this
                reduction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Accordingly, adopting a broad brush approach,
                    I reduced the monthly maintenance for the wife from $1,000 to $500 and for each
                    child from $2,000 to $1,500, totalling $3,500. I ordered the reduction to take
                    effect from December 2011 after the completion of the purchase of the HDB flat.
                    In my view, although the sale proceeds of the matrimonial property were
                    distributed in December 2010, it was not unreasonable for the wife to rent an
                    apartment in the meantime pending the purchase of the HDB flat. The wife did
                    take prompt steps to purchase the HDB flat immediately after the observation
                    which I made at the first hearing on 26 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The appeal by the husband was substantially
                    dismissed. The appeal against the division of matrimonial property was dismissed
                    while the maintenance order was reduced primarily due to a change in
                    circumstances arising from the recent purchase of the HDB flat by the wife
                    though I have no doubt that the husband’s appeal helped to hasten the
                    process. The variations to the access time were principally by consent. In the
                    circumstances, I ordered the husband to pay the wife costs fixed at $2,000
                    inclusive of disbursements.</p>
