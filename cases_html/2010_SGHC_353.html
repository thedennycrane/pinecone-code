<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Henry Ang Hai San, brings this
                    suit against the defendants, Ang Bee Lin Elizabeth (“Elizabeth
                    Ang”) and Andrew Ang Soon Chye (“Andrew Ang”) for a
                    declaration that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The plaintiff is the sole beneficial owner of
                            No 68 Jalan Naung Singapore 537730 (“the Property”);
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that Elizabeth Ang and Andrew Ang are trustees of
                            the Property.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff also seeks an order that the defendants are to convey the
                    Property to him absolutely forthwith, and an injunction to restrain them from
                    disposing of the Property except as ordered by the court. In these proceedings,
                    only Elizabeth Ang entered an appearance. Andrew Ang did not enter an
                    appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is the elder brother of Elizabeth
                    Ang and Andrew Ang. Their parents were married in 1943. Around 1951, their
                    father moved away from the family and lived with various mistresses thereafter.
                    In or about 1967, their father lived in a rented property with a mistress (the
                    “Mistress”) and the three children she bore him. At about the same
                    time, the plaintiff began shouldering the burden of the sole breadwinner,
                    providing for his younger siblings and their mother, Chia Lye Neo. In 1975,
                    their father retired at the age of 55 and became entitled to withdraw his
                    Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) savings. It is not disputed that in
                    1975, their father made a $27,000 contribution from his CPF savings towards the
                    purchase price of the Property, which was eventually registered in the name of
                    their mother. The Property was purchased on 7 April 1976 at the price of
                    $69,000. It is undisputed that their father and the Mistress lived at the
                    Property while their mother lived at a separate rented property with several of
                    her children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Their father died on 3 April 1999, and
                    their mother died intestate on 17 October 2002. Their mother left ten
                    surviving children. Elizabeth Ang and Andrew Ang are the administrators of their
                    mother’s estate under letters of administration dated 27 September
                    2004 and extracted on 10 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The disputed facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The only factual dispute between the plaintiff
                    and Elizabeth Ang in this action turns on who had paid the purchase price of the
                    Property. The plaintiff claims that their father had entered into an arrangement
                    with him as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff would pay for the purchase price of
                            the property;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">to assist the plaintiff, their father would
                            contribute $30,000 towards the purchase from his CPF
                        savings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff would pay the rental of the rented
                            property at which their mother and his siblings lived, which continued
                            to be their father’s responsibility;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">their father and the Mistress would live in the
                            Property rent-free for as long as their father wished;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff would pay the outgoings such as
                            property tax and insurance relating to the Property.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff’s evidence is that before
                    the Property was purchased, their mother learnt about this planned arrangement
                    and was very upset. In order to placate their mother, he registered the Property
                    in her name. The plaintiff produced evidence to show that he had provided for
                    the payments to purchase the Property as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a cheque bearing number P081479 dated
                            3 January 1976 for $2,000 paid to and acknowledged by the
                            vendor;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a cheque bearing number CBb30737 dated
                            3 February 1976 for $10,000 to the plaintiff’s solicitor for
                            the purchase;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$27,000 from the father’s CPF savings, paid
                            to the plaintiff’s solicitors for the purchase; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a $30,000 loan from Credit POSB Pte
                        Ltd.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff gave evidence that the cheques in (a) and (b) above were
                    issued by him, and the moneys were paid out from his bank account. It was his
                    evidence that the loan stated above in (d) was secured by a mortgage over the
                    Property, with their mother named as the sole mortgagor. The plaintiff was the
                    guarantor and the person who had borne the burden of all the instalment loan
                    repayments. The plaintiff paid the instalment loan repayments by way of cheques
                    directly to Credit POSB Pte Ltd and cheque and cash deposits into his
                    mother’s POSB Account No 23-XXXXX-X (“mother’s POSB
                    Account”), which was held jointly with another one of her sons, Philip
                    Ang Chin Chye. Their mother’s POSB Account was used for making the
                    instalment loan repayments. In support of this, the plaintiff annexed to his
                    affidavit extracts from his mother’s POSB Account passbook and copies of
                    cheques which stated the mother as payee from 1976 until 1986. His
                    mother’s POSB Account passbook reveals that a total amount of $4,000 in
                    cash was deposited into her POSB Account in 1976. Between 1977 and 1986, a total
                    of $3,588.35 was deposited by the plaintiff into her POSB Account. The plaintiff
                    avers that he had deposited the $4,000 into her POSB Account in 1976. The copies
                    of cheques were self-explanatory in that they show that the plaintiff had
                    written various cheques to her between 1976 and 1986, paying her a total of
                    $43,415.62. The plaintiff avers that these payments were made for the purpose of
                    repaying the loan and interest taken out for the purchase of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Elizabeth Ang’s pleaded case is a
                    straightforward one. She denies that their father had made the purported
                    arrangement with the plaintiff as described above, at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>. She avers that on 3 October 1975, their father had
                    called and told her over the telephone that he had withdrawn his CPF savings of
                    more than $30,000.00 upon reaching the age of 55. He had told her that he wanted
                    to distribute to each of his children a portion of his withdrawn CPF savings.
                    She had then advised him against doing that and that he should purchase a
                    property with his CPF savings instead. She avers that their father agreed with
                    her and that when she asked him in whose name it was to be registered, he had
                    replied “put your mother’s name lah! Put whose name? [<em>sic</em>]”. She also avers that the plaintiff had
                    never mentioned to her the existence of any purported arrangement between
                    himself and their father prior to these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I turn to consider the pivotal issue of whether
                    a resulting trust arises with respect to the Property given the facts before me.
                    If there is on the evidence before me a resulting trust in favour of the
                    plaintiff, then the Property would not form part of their mother’s estate.
                    In <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew Kim</em>”),
                    the Singapore Court of Appeal recognised that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    Resulting trusts are
                            presumed to arise in two sets of circumstances. These circumstances were
                            appositely summarised by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in [<em>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London
                                Borough Council</em> [1996] AC 669] at 708 as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Under existing law a resulting trust arises in two sets of
                            circumstances: (A) where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays
                            (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either
                            in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that
                            A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is held on
                            trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of
                            a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their
                            contributions. It is important to stress that this is only a <em>presumption</em>, which presumption is easily
                            rebutted either by the counter-presumption of advancement or by direct
                            evidence of A’s intention to make an outright transfer …
                            (B) Where A transfers property to B <em>on express
                                trusts</em>, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole
                            beneficial interest … Both types of resulting trust are
                            traditionally regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common
                            intention of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law
                            against the intentions of the trustee (as is a constructive trust) but
                            gives effect to his presumed intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       We are here concerned with the implication of
                    resulting trust of type (A) above. The presumption of a resulting trust is an
                        “<em>inference</em> or even an <em>estimate</em> as to what a party’s intention is likely
                    to be, based on certain assumptions arising from a set of given facts”:
                        <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [37]. The usual inference in a
                    situation where one person pays for the purchase of a property registered in the
                    name of another, is that the first person did <em>not</em>
                    intend to make an absolute gift to the second person, unless they fall into
                    certain established categories of relationships out of which a presumption of
                    advancement arises to displace the presumption of resulting trust. I also refer
                    to <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [57] where V K Rajah
                    JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... We are of the view that a two-stage test remains helpful and, indeed,
                        necessary. The court must first determine if the presumption of resulting
                        trust arises on the facts; and it is <em>only</em> if a
                        resulting trust is presumed that the presumption of advancement would apply
                        to displace that initial presumption. In addition, it should also be noted
                        that the actual <em>effect</em> of the presumptions of
                        resulting trust and advancement relates to the <em>burden of
                            proof</em> in the particular case. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where it has been proven that a child has paid for the purchase of
                    property in the name of his mother or father, the only presumption which arises
                    is that of a resulting trust. This is because equity does not readily presume
                    that children generally intend to make gifts to their parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Thus, relying on the above authorities, I need
                    only consider whether the presumption of resulting trust arises in the
                    plaintiff’s favour on the facts of this case, and if so, whether Elizabeth
                    Ang has rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities. I am satisfied
                    that in the light of objective evidence such as the extracts from the
                    mother’s POSB Account passbook and the cheques which the plaintiff had
                    written in favour of their mother(see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above), the plaintiff has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that he had
                    paid for the purchase of the property which was in her name. Thus, the
                    presumption of resulting trust operates in favour of the plaintiff. If the
                    presumption of resulting trust is unrebutted, the Property would not form part
                    of the mother’s estate. I am of the view that Elizabeth Ang has not
                    rebutted the presumption of resulting trust. I appreciate that the burden which
                    rests on her is not easily discharged given that their father has since died and
                    her main contention is that their father had paid for the purchase price of the
                    Property. The evidence clearly indicates that their father had given the
                    plaintiff S$30,000 towards the purchase price of the Property. It was the
                    plaintiff who was the guarantor to the bank loan and who made all the loan and
                    interest repayments as well as paid the other payables in respect of the
                    Property. Elizabeth Ang has not been able to adduce any corroborating evidence
                    of her telephone conversation with their father, quite apart from whether it was
                    and remained his intention at the time of the purchase of the Property.
                    Elizabeth Ang further relies on her recollection of the plaintiff having sought
                    the mother’s permission to sell the Property as evidence that the
                    plaintiff could not have been the sole beneficial owner of the Property. Even if
                    I were to accept this, it does not follow that this evinces what she asserts. As
                    the Property was registered in the mother’s name, her agreement to such
                    sale and signature on the relevant sale documents would be necessary and this
                    could account for the reason he sought her approval. Elizabeth Ang’s
                    account of their mother’s suspicions of the plaintiff’s proposal to
                    sell the Property has no direct bearing on the question of their father’s
                    true intentions <em>at the time of the purchase of the
                        property</em>. Therefore, I find that Elizabeth Ang has failed to
                    rebut the presumption of a resulting trust in favour of the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I turn now to consider whether the
                    contribution of S$30,000 towards the purchase price of the Property by the
                    plaintiff’s father had any bearing on the resulting trust which I find
                    ought to be declared in favour of the plaintiff. I am of the view that although
                    $27,000 out of the purchase price of $69,000 originated from the father’s
                    CPF savings, the plaintiff has discharged his burden of proving on a balance of
                    probabilities, that (a) his father had promised to give him $30,000 in
                    exchange for allowing the father and his mistress to stay rent-free at the
                    Property; (b) the plaintiff would pay for the Property’s outgoings;
                    and (c) the plaintiff would pay for the rental of his mother’s
                    accommodation. It was in the light of this agreement between the plaintiff and
                    his father that the plaintiff’s father had given the entire amount of
                    $30,000 to the plaintiff. Therefore, I find that the $30,000 belonged to the
                    plaintiff and was applied towards the purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Given my findings, I grant the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the plaintiff is the sole
                            beneficial owner of the Property;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the Property does not form
                            part of their mother’s estate; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an order that Elizabeth Ang and Andrew Ang are to
                            convey the legal title of the Property to the plaintiff absolutely
                            within six weeks.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Costs to be agreed or taxed are to be paid
                    from the mother’s estate to the plaintiff. In the event that there are no
                    sufficient or remaining funds in the mother’s estate to meet these costs,
                    such costs to be paid by Elizabeth Ang to the plaintiff.</p>
