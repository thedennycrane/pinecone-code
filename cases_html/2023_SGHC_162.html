It is not seriously disputed that Henry and Chia later entered into a romantic relationship and that Chia moved into Henry’s home, The Tiara, either in 2011 (as claimed by Chia) or in 2013 (as claimed by Judy). This is despite Judy initially asserting that Henry and Chia were never in a “committed, loving or romantic relationship” and that Chia was merely Henry’s “caregiver”.

However, the evidence shows that by end 2019, her relationship with Henry was strained and they were speaking about going their separate ways. Henry’s calendar recorded that they quarrelled on 25 and 28 December 2019, that Chia “left” on 30 December 2019, and that they “broke off” on 31 December 2019.

Nevertheless, I find Henry continued to have feelings for Chia and was concerned for her, even if Chia did not reciprocate in the same manner or to the same degree. This can be seen from the audio messages between them from July to September 2020, and by Judy’s conduct in reaching out to Chia on 12 October 2020 (after Henry had suffered the second stroke) to ask her to return to Singapore to support Henry.

This resulted in Henry losing a tremendous amount of weight and developing paranoia and persecutory delusions against his family.

Chia disputes the authenticity of the Two Letters and Mr Cheong (Chia’s counsel) submits in Closing Submissions that they were not pleaded, but only raised in Judy’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) to prove a trust.

Second, Chia has not been caught by surprise. The Two Letters were already exhibited in Judy’s application for a Mareva injunction (“Mareva Application”), filed at the commencement of the Suit. In the Mareva Application, Judy referred to the Two Letters to show that Henry did not intend to give Chia more assets (to support a Mareva injunction against some of the Assets which included the KL Property and the Bonds).

Chia had put the matter into issue and knew the case she had to meet. There was no prejudice to her and so I reject Mr Cheong’s belated submissions in this regard made only after the close of the trial.

However, Shikshita agreed during cross-examination that in some of the Other Documents, Henry’s signatures did not have a “hook” at the end of the first letter, and the distance between the first and second letters was very close. These showed that the signatures in the Other Documents were more similar to those in the Two Letters rather than in S-001.

</div> Chia claims that Dr Fones’ views on when Henry lost mental capacity cannot be accepted, as there was no mental capacity assessment carried out on Henry between October 2020 and April 2021. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Section 4(1) of the MCA provides that an individual lacks capacity if he is “unable to make a decision for himself” because of an impairment, or a disturbance in the function, of the mind or brain. Section 5(1) provides that an individual is considered to be “unable to make a decision for himself” if he is unable: (a) to understand information relevant to that decision; (b) to retain that information; (c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or (d) to communicate his decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The test for mental capacity in s 4(1) of the MCA involves a functional and a clinical component. On the functional aspect, the individual in question (P) must be unable to make a decision, and on the clinical aspect, this inability must be caused by a mental impairment. The court would require the assistance of expert evidence on the clinical component, to apprise the court whether P has a mental impairment, what that impairment is, and what effect it has on P’s cognitive abilities. As for the functional component, this is a question for the court to determine (see <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>[2015] 4 SLR 81 at [134]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I accept on balance that Henry had lost mental capacity from about 9 October 2020. This is supported by the plaintiff’s expert evidence in relation to the clinical component. As for the functional component, the testimony of individuals who interacted with Henry after the second stroke and the contemporaneous evidence show that he had been unable to make decisions as he could not understand or weigh the information relevant to so doing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The expert evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I begin by considering the expert evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I find Dr Burn’s opinion unhelpful in supporting Chia’s position. Dr Burns did not see Henry or interview Henry’s friends and family members, and his opinion is based solely on medical information provided by Chia’s lawyers, including Dr Fones’ medical report. In fact, Dr Burns did not outrightly disagree with Dr Fones’ assessment that Henry likely did not have mental capacity from 9 October 2020. Instead, Dr Burns was unable to say “with certainty” or conclude with “one hundred percent certainty” that Henry had lost mental capacity on 9 October 2020 because he had not examined Henry.

Dr Ho stated that he could not (on 5 September 2022 when he prepared his report) ascertain Henry’s mental capacity as at 15 October 2020 as no formal assessment of such was done on that occasion, and any such formal assessment attempted in October 2020 would likely have been unsuccessful because of Henry’s stroke-related aphasia as Henry clearly had major problems with language then.

Dr Fones assessed that Henry suffers from “Major Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder with [b]ehavioural disturbance” which came about after the second stroke.

This was although Dr Fones took “all practical steps … to enhance [Henry’s] understanding and communication” such as “using simple language, multiple languages (English, Teochew, Mandarin), visual aids/pictures, written instructions”. In court, Dr Fones elaborated that when he examined Henry on 15 April 2021, Henry’s communication ability remained “very poor” and he was unable to engage in any conversation. Dr Fones further stated that most improvements, if at all, would occur in the first three months following a stroke, <span class="font-italic">which Dr Burns also accepted</span>, and that it would be “very unusual to see any dramatic improvements after 6 months”.

This showed that Henry was unable to retain or understand recent information conveyed to him and supports his lack of mental capacity. As Dr Burns stated, Henry was showing signs of distress.

</div> I disregard these documents. In reliance on the court’s directions dated 1 March 2023, Mr Cheong claims the court had given Chia leave to produce the documents. But this is disingenuous as the court did not give leave to any party to adduce further evidence not already adduced at trial. The court merely directed parties to “submit on” the existing documents to support their respective assertions on the payments for maintenance and upkeep of the property, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to make their submissions on this point. The court gave parties the opportunity to file further submissions, to reply to issues in the opposing party’s earlier submissions but based on the evidence already adduced. This was not a backdoor means for fresh evidence to be adduced without leave and where the opposing party would not have the opportunity to deal with such evidence in cross-examination. Indeed, the court had, during the trial, given Chia the opportunity to adduce further evidence, but she did not produce the New Documents despite having more than a month between two tranches of trial dates to do so.

Further, despite Chia producing (by the New Documents) bank transfers of <span class="font-italic">earlier</span> payments purportedly for the maintenance of the KL Property, she was strangely unable to produce documents of <span class="font-italic">later</span> payments pertaining to the period in the 2021 Statement.

I reject this assertion as an attempt to shore up her case that the property was a gift to her, which was why Henry’s family members did not take an interest in it. Chia’s assertion flew in the face of the evidence (and her admission in court) that Judy went to view the KL Property in June 2019, which Judy stated was to assist with its renovations at Henry’s request.

</div> By Chia’s testimony, Henry made all the decisions to purchase and then sell the MM2 Shares without her knowledge.

Moreover, if the shares belonged to Chia, it was strange that Henry did not inform her before he sold them, and particularly when they were sold <span class="font-italic">at a substantial loss</span>. Indeed, the picture Chia painted in court of her complete ignorance regarding the shares, was different from the impression conveyed in her AEIC that she <span class="font-italic">was</span> aware of the purchase and subsequent sale of the shares at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Hence, I find the MM2 Shares belonged to Henry. His conduct of having dealt with the shares freely and Chia’s ignorance of the matter show that Henry never treated the shares (or the proceeds of their sale) as belonging to Chia. Although the sale proceeds were paid to Chia’s name, this is neutral as the shares were registered in her name.

In other words, the $900,000 to purchase the Earlier Bonds came from this $1m in 2015.

</div> It was improbable for Chia to have amassed savings of her own of no less than $801,385.99 in the Joint TD A/C based on her employment history. She worked as a hairdresser for about seven years between 2003 and 2010 where she claimed her salary was above $1,000. This was not a substantial sum. As for her employment at ATEC Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd (which Judy claims was a sham), even if I accept that it was a genuine employment, Chia’s notice of assessment of income shows her total income for 2017 to be only $36,000.

There is no evidence that the bank had raised any issues with the fact that Chia had originally placed moneys in accounts in her sole name. Hence, it made no sense to then transfer the moneys into a joint account with Henry. When queried in court, Chia could not give an explanation.

Although Henry had in the Two Letters referred to a “Joint Account” or “UOB Joint Account”, I accept that he was referring to the Joint i-A/C and Joint TD A/C collectively. The bank statements show that the Joint TD A/C was part of the joint accounts held by Henry and Chia in UOB.

In the present case where the plaintiff (P) is essentially relying on presumed undue influence (or “Class 2” undue influence), P has to show: (a) a relationship of trust and confidence between him and the defendant (D); (b) the relationship was such that it could be presumed that D abused P’s trust and confidence in influencing P to enter into the impugned transaction; and (c) the transaction was one that calls for an explanation. A “Class 2” undue influence can be further divided into “Class 2A” and “Class 2B”. In particular, under “Class 2B”, P must prove a relationship of trust and confidence and that the transaction calls for an explanation.

Because of the large sum, Ricky did a verification with Henry as to his identity and to confirm his instructions regarding the transfer. Ricky attested that the purpose of the transfer to Chia’s account was for Chia to “manage the fund”. This was based on the bank’s standard form in which the customer would declare the purpose of the withdrawal or transfer of the moneys, and which contents of the form Ricky saw (although he was not involved in filling up the form).

Henry’s conduct in taking his mother’s money so that he could “give” Chia $500,000 by way of the Second Cheque can only be explained by the fact that he was under Chia’s undue influence and could not understand the consequences of his action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In the round, I find that there was at least “Class 2B” undue influence which taints the transfer of the Two Sums to Chia, and Chia has failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 A resulting trust also arises in relation to the Two Sums as Chia did not contribute any moneys to Henry’s UOB A/C (from which the Two Cheques were made).

I agree with Mr Narayanan that Henry’s lack of mental capacity to effect the transfer of The Tiara was all the more apparent from the fact that he disregarded his lawyer’s advice to include a protective clause in the Deed (for him to have a life interest in or to reside at The Tiara) and that he did not seem to be concerned about whether he had a place to live after he transferred the property to Chia.

Chia was telling Henry, among other things, not to frustrate her; that he was making her feel awful; that he was nagging her to the point that she felt that he wanted to kill her or take her life; that he should see a doctor or psychiatrist if he was unwell or crazy; that he should get off her back and “go bother Judy”; and that if things continued the way they were, she would leave him or “jump”.

Contrary to her claim that the document was prepared without her inputs, she stated in court that the items listed in Annexure A were written on her instructions. It is also not disputed that after the 6/4/21 Document was prepared, Tammy translated it to Chia in Mandarin or Teochew and Chia accepted the list in Annexure A was accurate, except that she did not say “Oct 2020 cash” and “$1 million MM2 Shares”.

As Chia stated, she had Tammy and Mr Li Nanxing accompany her to The Tiara because she was afraid. I accept that she was then “emotionally shaken” and she felt rushed to come up with a list of items that she had obtained from Henry.

</div> That the $800,000 sum being “cash” obtained in “Oct 2020” could have been a mistake or not been uttered by Chia is supported by the fact that the two $500,000 sums (listed in Annexure A) as stated to pertain to the “$1 million MM2 Shares” (which Chia claims she also did not utter these words) was also inaccurate as these clearly referred to the Two Sums which are unrelated to the Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Ultimately, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving his case, which I find the plaintiff has not discharged on balance.

This is determined by either its market value at the date of conversion or the cost of replacing the item (<span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 at [29], [30] and [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The plaintiff has shown there was an available market for the Watches and Jewellery.

</div> The available market here must be seen in view of the goods being offered to the market, namely second-hand luxury goods which may be of limited quantity. I further accept the last listing price of the items as reflected on the Carousell Account as the price at which they were sold and as the market value of the Watches and Jewellery at the time of conversion. It is unlikely that their value would have fluctuated greatly (and downwards) in a short span of time between Chia’s conversion and the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 It is clear that substantial loss has been incurred, as the Watches and Jewellery were luxury goods. Hence whilst the plaintiff bore the burden of proving the quantum of loss, that an assessment is difficult is in itself not a reason not to award damages or to award merely nominal damages. The difficulty in assessing the precise quantum is because of Chia’s wrongful conversion of the items, such that only Chia would know how much they were sold for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Hence, I award damages of $943,000, as the market value of the Watches and Jewellery based on the final listed prices on the Carousell Account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Having found Chia liable for the Assets (except for s/n 5 at [3] above), I make the following orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I set aside the Deed pertaining to The Tiara, and order that Chia transfer The Tiara to Henry. Chia is also to bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer. In this regard, as I find the $218,000 Cheque was a payment procured from Henry for Chia’s benefit, where a refund is made by the relevant tax authority to Chia, this sum would be held on trust for Henry. Alternatively, Chia is to compensate Henry the sum of $218,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Chia is to transfer the KL Property to Henry, as I have found the KL Property to be held on a resulting trust for him. Likewise, Chia is to bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Chia is to return $64,268.40 to Henry, being the value of the Coupon paid on the Bonds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 As for the Bonds itself, Mr Narayanan has stated that there were new developments in that the Bonds had been restructured.
