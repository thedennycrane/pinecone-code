Captain Koh Chen Tien (“Cpt Koh”) is OWG’s sole shareholder and Executive Director, and was also the Managing Director of the Charterer at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present appeal, Civil Appeal No 180 of 2019 (“CA 180”), is OWG’s appeal against the trial judge’s (“the Judge”) decision to grant summary judgment to the Respondent for part of the sum claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Original Charterparty dated 28 October 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 28 October 2013, the Charterer entered into a time charterparty (“the Original Charterparty”) with POSH in relation to the vessel “POSH Pelican” (“the Vessel”) on the terms of a BIMCO Supplytime 2005 standard contract and additional clauses. Pursuant to cl 41 of the Original Charterparty, the Charterer provided a bank guarantee to POSH for US$1.293m which was issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (“the RBS Guarantee”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Guarantees dated 24 October 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As of 17 October 2014, POSH claimed that the Charterer owed POSH a sum of over US$3.7m pursuant to the Original Charterparty. The Charterer sought to persuade POSH to withdraw its call on the RBS Guarantee. POSH agreed to do so, provided that OWG (and three other parties related to the Charterer) furnish guarantees to POSH for the purpose of securing performance of the Charterer’s obligations under the Original Charterparty. On 24 October 2014, multiple guarantees by OWG, MPS, Cpt Koh and Dr Abdullah Aseeri Ali were signed with reference to the Original Charterparty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Of particular significance was the OWG Guarantee issued by OWG in favour of POSH, which provided that OWG “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee[d] … the due and faithful performance by the Charterer of all its obligations contained in the Supplytime 2005”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Settlement Agreement dated 15 November 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Following the execution of the OWG Guarantee, the Charterer continued to be in significant arrears. On 15 November 2015, the Charterer and POSH entered into a settlement agreement in relation to the outstanding debt (“the Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement set out the parties’ agreement on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, (a) the Charterer’s outstanding debt under the Original Charterparty of US$2,891,241.54 as of 30 June 2015 (“the Outstanding Debt”); (b) the Charterer’s payment plan to POSH with regard to the settlement sum of US$2,119,461.56 in eight monthly instalments over a period between November 2015 and June 2016 (“the Settlement Sum”) in full and final settlement and discharge of any and all past or present claims that POSH had against the Charterer; (c) the amendment of the Original Charterparty by way of Addendum No 1 of the Settlement Agreement; and (d) that in the event that any of the eight instalments was not paid by the stipulated timeline, the entire Outstanding Debt would immediately become payable. The Original Charterparty, as amended by Addendum No 1 of the Settlement Agreement, shall be referred to as “the Post-Addendum Charterparty”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of the Settlement Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 31 January 2016, the Charterer failed to make payment of the 3rd instalment under the Settlement Agreement by the agreed date. The balance of the Outstanding Debt fell due, and POSH was entitled to immediately claim the said sum under the Settlement Agreement. Between 16 February 2016 and 21 March 2016, POSH repeatedly demanded that the Charterer fulfil its obligation to pay the remaining Outstanding Debt plus sums which had accrued under the Charterparty subsequent to 30 June 2015, while reserving its rights to withdraw the vessel and terminate the Charterparty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 26 March 2016, POSH withdrew its vessel and terminated the Charterparty for the Charterer’s alleged repudiatory breach in accordance with the three-day notification period under the early termination clause of the Post-Addendum Charterparty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In SUM 50, the Judge held that (a) summary judgment be entered in favour of POSH against OWG for the sum of US$3,306.446.50 with interest and costs (“the Summary Judgment”); and (b) OWG be granted unconditional leave to defend POSH’s claim for the remaining amount of US$771,779.98, being the difference between the 30 June 2015 Outstanding Debt and the Settlement Sum (see [10(f)] below). The Judge made the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The obligation by OWG to pay under the OWG Guarantee was not triggered by a demand whether justified or not, but required that there be real liability on the part of the Charterer for the OWG Guarantee to bite.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was good consideration for the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) POSH was entitled to withdraw the Vessel and the Post-Addendum Charterparty was rightfully and validly terminated at the point of withdrawal of the Vessel.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The terms of the Settlement Agreement and the obligations which arose thereunder fell within the ambit of the OWG Guarantee. The effect of the non-payment of the 3rd instalment in the Settlement Agreement was to accelerate the Charterer’s duty to pay the Outstanding Debt. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) However, as the Settlement Agreement was governed by Saudi law, questions arose as to the validity of the enforcement of the acceleration provision. OWG had raised a triable issue and had an arguable defence that could only be resolved at a trial where expert evidence on Saudi law will be adduced. As a result, judgment could not be given for the remaining amount of US$771,779.98. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The difference in liability of the Charterer depended on whether the acceleration was rightful or wrongful, which was calculated as the difference between the Outstanding Debt and the Settlement Sum in the Settlement Agreement. That was the only sum truly in issue between the parties on the effect of the evidence on Saudi law (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, US$771,779.98).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) As for the issue of interest, there was a contractual interest rate at 1% per month which had to be applied for the claims made under the Post-Addendum Charterparty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 We now turn to our decision. We first deal with an important preliminary issue of corporate self-representation by foreign bodies corporate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue of corporate self-representation by foreign bodies corporate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 16 March 2020, we allowed an application made by OWG’s counsel, NLC Law Asia LLC, to be discharged. At the hearing before us on 1 April 2020, Cpt Koh appeared as an authorised representative for OWG as OWG had not appointed new solicitors, and sought an adjournment of the appeal on the basis that OWG was not legally represented. We allowed the adjournment until the week commencing 25 May 2020 and expressly ordered that no further adjournments would be entertained, noting that the hearing of the appeal would be subject to the decision of the court as to whether the appeal could proceed if OWG was still not legally represented. At the final hearing on 5 August 2020, OWG once again appeared before the court without legal representation (notwithstanding the fact that it had effectively a little over <span class="font-italic">two months more</span> to secure legal representation as the hearing initially scheduled for the week commencing 25 May 2020 had been further vacated and adjourned). A preliminary issue therefore arises as to whether OWG, a Malaysian registered body corporate, must be represented by a solicitor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Counsel for POSH, Mr Jason Chan SC, submitted at the hearing on 1 April 2020 that a foreign body corporate such as OWG cannot appear before the Court of Appeal hearing an SICC matter unless represented by a solicitor by virtue of O 5 r 6(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), and cannot avail itself of the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) of the same (which would permit corporate self-representation with the leave of court). However, we noted then that the imposition of such a requirement on foreign bodies corporate would lead to a somewhat unsatisfactory outcome that runs counter to the very purpose of establishing the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”), which is to “grow the legal services sector and to expand the scope for the internationalisation and export of Singapore law” (see sicc.gov.sg/about-the-sicc/establishment-of-the-sicc (accessed 5 August 2020)). The issue of whether corporate self-representation for <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> bodies corporate is permissible in Singapore thus arises as a crucial threshold point in the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The default position of no corporate self-representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We begin by examining the key provisions governing the issue of corporate self-representation in Singapore. In Singapore, the starting point is that a body corporate is generally prohibited from commencing or carrying on any action, as well as from entering an appearance in or defending such action, “otherwise than by a solicitor”. This is provided for in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) of the Rules, which state as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Right to sue in person (O. 5, r. 6)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to Order 1, Rule 9(2) and any other written law, and except in accordance with any practice directions for the time being issued by the Registrar, <span class="font-italic">a body corporate</span> may not <span class="font-italic">begin or carry on any proceedings</span> in Court <span class="font-italic">otherwise than by a solicitor.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mode of entering appearance (O. 12, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to Order 1, Rule 9(2) and any other written law, and except in accordance with any practice directions for the time being issued by the Registrar, <span class="font-italic">a defendant to an action </span>begun by writ which is <span class="font-italic">a body corporate</span> <span class="font-italic">may not enter an appearance in the action or defend it</span> <span class="font-italic">otherwise than by a solicitor. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The definition of “Court” in the context of the Rules is set out at O 1 r 4(2) of the Rules (“O 1 r 4(2)”) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Definitions (O. 1, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  In these Rules [meaning, the ROC], <span class="font-italic">unless the context otherwise requires</span>, “Court” means the <span class="font-italic">High Court or a District Court, or a judge of the High Court or District Judge, </span>whether sitting in Court or in Chambers, and includes, in cases where he is empowered to act, a Magistrate or the Registrar; but the foregoing provision shall not be taken as affecting any provision of these Rules and, in particular, Order 32, Rule 9, by virtue of which the authority and jurisdiction of the Registrar is defined and regulated. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 We make several observations in this regard. First, the general prohibition in O 5 r 6(2) of the Rules (“O 5 r 6(2)”) applies to a body corporate that <span class="font-italic">begins or carries on any proceedings</span>, while the general prohibition in O 12 r 1(2) of the Rules (“O 12 r 1(2)”) applies to a body corporate which is a <span class="font-italic">defendant to an action begun by writ</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>who <span class="font-italic">enters an appearance in the action or defend it</span>. Second, it appears that the ambit of the general prohibition against corporate self-representation in O 5 r 6(2) extends to the High Court and, at least arguably, the SICC (see O 1 r 4(2)). This is because the SICC is a division of the Singapore High Court (see s 18A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed)). By extension, the definition of “Court” in O 1 r 4 of the Rules would therefore include the SICC. On the other hand, the general prohibition in O 12 r 1(2) is <span class="font-italic">silent</span> on its application to the type of court proceedings, and there appears (at least on the face of the literal language of that particular rule) to be no equivalent limitation to its scope as in O 5 r 6(2), which is a point to which we shall return below (at [29]). Finally, the reference to “a solicitor” in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) also includes a registered foreign lawyer for the purposes of proceedings in the SICC (see O 110 r 1(1) and r 1(4) of the Rules). Given that OWG was a defendant in SUM 50, which was a matter that was heard before the SICC, the legal regime in O 12 r 1(2) at least arguably applies and prohibits OWG’s corporate self-representation in the present proceedings, and O 5 r 6(2), contrary to Mr Chan’s submissions, does not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The leave provision in O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) are, however, subject to the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules (“O 1 r 9(2)”), which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) … [T]he <span class="font-italic">Court</span> may, on an application by a <span class="font-italic">company</span> or a limited liability partnership, give leave for an officer of the company or limited liability partnership to act on behalf of the company or limited liability partnership in any relevant matter or proceeding to which the company or limited liability partnership is a party, if the Court is satisfied that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the officer has been duly authorised by the company or limited liability partnership to act on behalf of the company or limited liability partnership in that matter or proceeding;

As the leave mechanism pursuant to O 1 r 9(2) does not (for the reasons set out above) apply to <span class="font-italic">foreign </span>bodies corporate, this possible legal route for corporate self-representation is <span class="font-italic">un</span><span class="font-italic">available</span> as well to a party which is a <span class="font-italic">foreign </span>body corporate.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Given the fact that many SICC matters will involve one or more foreign bodies corporate, this leads to a somewhat less than satisfactory result, given the <span class="font-italic">raison d’</span><span class="font-italic">être </span>of the SICC (see [13] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 A possible <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> view is that Parliament, in drafting the governing provisions in the Rules, could not have intended to impose such onerous requirements on foreign bodies corporate in SICC matters because doing so would, as we have just observed, run counter to the very objective of establishing the SICC. We therefore turn now to analyse whether it is even possible for such alternative view to be adopted, which, in our judgment, can be possibly arrived at only through one of the following two ways: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the governing provisions in the Rules must be interpreted in such a manner that foreign bodies corporate involved in SICC matters do not fall within the ambit of the general prohibition against corporate self-representation set out in O 5 r 6(2) <span class="font-italic">and</span> O 12 r 1(2).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the general prohibitions in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) do apply to SICC matters, the governing provisions in the Rules must be interpreted in a manner such that the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) is still available to foreign bodies corporate appearing in SICC matters so as to enable corporate self-representation with the leave of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 We start by analysing the first option in [23(a)] above. According to this particular argument, one could possibly interpret the wording of O 5 r 6(2) to mean that the general prohibition therein does not apply to foreign bodies corporate appearing before the SICC. This could be done by excluding the SICC from the meaning of “High Court”, which is included in definition of “Court” in O 5 r 6(2) (see O 1 r 4(2)). Such an interpretation would be premised on the proposition that in drafting O 1 r 4(2), it could not have been intended that the definition of “High Court” would include the SICC. This view could be said to find support in the fact that the SICC was only officially established on 5 January 2015 (see sicc.gov.sg/about-the-sicc/establishment-of-the-sicc (accessed 5 August 2020)), <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 2014 amendments that extended the application of O 1 r 9(2) to proceedings before the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Family Court (see above at [20]). Alternatively, the situation involving a foreign body corporate appearing in SICC matters could be interpreted as one that falls within the wording “unless context otherwise requires”, which is an exception to the definition of “Court” in O 1 r 4(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, this option must, in our view, be rejected for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, this argument is squarely contradicted by O 110 rr 1(1) and 3 of the Rules, which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interpretation (O. 110, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.—(1) In this Order, unless the context otherwise requires —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“Court” means the Singapore International Commercial Court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application of Rules of Court (O. 110, r. 3)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.—(1) Subject to this Order, the provisions of these Rules [that is, the Rules] apply to all proceedings in the Court and all appeals from the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Arris</span><span class="font-italic"> Solutions, Inc v Asian Broadcasting Network (M) Sdn Bhd </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1 and <span class="font-italic">CPIT</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Ltd v Qilin World Capital Ltd and another </span>[2017] 5 SLR 148 (as well as <span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific Group and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanta Asset Management International Limited and another </span>[2017] 4 SLR 26), the SICC adopted the relevant rules in the High Court in relation to the grant of a summary judgment order and a stay of execution order, respectively. These cases reflect the effect of O 110 r 3 of the Rules which prescribes that the Rules are applicable to proceedings in the SICC if not otherwise already specifically provided for in O 110 of the Rules (“O 110”) (see also <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020, </span>vol 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2019) at para 110/0/2). In the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Jacob Agam and another</span> [2019] 1 SLR 83, O 110 rr 1(1) and 3 of the Rules were applied in the same manner in relation to the issue of the service of court documents. It was held that since there was no provision in O 110 dealing with the issue of service of court documents, the general rules in the Rules relating to the service of non-originating processes in a non-SICC context governed the service of the Application Documents in that case, pursuant to O 110 rr 1 and 3 of the Rules (at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There is no express provision in O 110 dealing with the issue of corporate self-representation. Hence, the general prohibition against commencing or carrying on any action, as well as from entering an appearance in or defending such action, “otherwise than by a solicitor”, in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) will apply equally to <span class="font-italic">all proceedings in </span><span class="font-italic">the SICC and (as a matter of logic and common sense) to all appeals from the SICC </span>pursuant to O 110 rr 1 and 3 of the Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, in any case, even if the general prohibition in O 5 r 6(2) were to be interpreted in a manner that excludes SICC matters, we cannot see how the language of O 12 r 1(2) can be interpreted to exclude SICC matters. In particular (and as we have noted at [16] above), the language of O 12 r 1(2) does not contain any limitations with regard to the application of the general prohibition in so far as the types of court proceedings are concerned. <span class="font-italic">Further</span>, if we accept the proposition that for foreign bodies corporate appearing before the SICC, the general prohibition in O 5 r 6(2) does not apply to a <span class="font-italic">plaintiff who begins or carries on the proceedings</span>, while the general prohibition in O 12 r 1(2) applies to a <span class="font-italic">defendant entering an appearance in an action or defending it</span>, this would lead to <span class="font-italic">an inexplicable inconsistency</span> between the two rules. An illogical procedural advantage would be created in favour of a plaintiff over a defendant when, in fact, the <span class="font-italic">converse</span> ought to be true inasmuch as a defendant should, instead, be offered a slight procedural advantage over a plaintiff because the defendant is effectively before the court involuntarily. For example, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Bulk Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Pevensey Pte Ltd and another</span> [2015] 1 SLR 538 (“<span class="font-italic">Bulk Trading</span>”), it was observed that the court should be more willing to grant leave pursuant to O 1 r 9(2) where the company is the defendant because the defendant company is effectively before the court involuntarily (at [100]–[101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For the above reasons, we are of the view that the first option must be rejected. Indeed, given our analysis above, there is no countervailing exception based on context (see [24] above) that could be relied upon by a foreign body corporate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We turn now to analyse the second possible option (at [23(b)]): if the prohibitions in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) do apply to SICC matters, can O 1 r 9(2) nevertheless be interpreted so as to avail foreign bodies corporate of the <span class="font-italic">leave mechanism</span> in <span class="font-italic">O</span><span class="font-italic"> 1 r 9(2)</span> in order to appear in SICC matters with the leave of court? In our judgment, the second option must also be rejected. There is simply no way of interpreting “company” in O 1 r 9(2) to include <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> bodies corporate which are <span class="font-italic">not</span> incorporated under Singapore’s Companies Act. The definition of “company” in O 1 r 9(6) (see [18] above) is unequivocally clear. This is further supported by the observations made by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Bulk Trading</span> that the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) was <span class="font-italic">not</span> available to foreign bodies corporate (at [22]), although we do note that these observations were made in a non-SICC context:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... the present application [pursuant to O 1 r 9(2) of the ROC] is correctly made only in respect of Pevensey <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> and not Pevensey <span class="font-italic">Indonesia</span>, as the definition of “company” in O 1 r 9(6) of the ROC refers only to a company incorporated under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For the above reasons, we hold that under the present legal regime, the prohibitions against corporate self-representation in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) do apply to SICC matters <span class="font-italic">and</span> that the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) is not available to foreign bodies corporate appearing in SICC matters as a possible legal avenue for corporate self-representation with leave of court. There are <span class="font-italic">limits</span> to the manner in which given provisions (here, rules of court) can be interpreted. This court <span class="font-italic">cannot effectively rewrite </span>the relevant rules in order to achieve what it perceives will be a just and fair result. That would be an impermissible exercise of a <span class="font-italic">legislative </span>function and would be clearly beyond the jurisdiction and power of the court. Any change must therefore be made by way of the appropriate legislative amendments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We pause to observe that there are of course cogent policy reasons behind the general prohibition against the lay representation of companies (including foreign bodies corporate) and for the requirement for a <span class="font-italic">local </span>corporate litigant, as opposed to a <span class="font-italic">foreign</span> body corporate, to first seek leave of court before being able to represent itself in proceedings. This was succinctly discussed in <span class="font-italic">Bulk Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [47]–[48]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47  There are sound reasons for requiring a corporate litigant to first seek leave of court before being able to represent itself in proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Winn v Stewart Bros Constructions Pty Ltd </span>[2012] SASC 150 …, Blue J identified three such rationales at [38] which can all be linked to the court’s inherent desire to ensure that justice is administered both fairly and efficiently in the interests of the immediate parties and the wider public:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The opposite party may be <span class="font-italic">disadvantaged by the time and cost of the proceeding being extended due to the company not being represented by a legally qualified advocate.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. The public interest in <span class="font-italic">the efficient and timely administration of justice may be prejudiced</span> by the time and cost of the proceeding being extended due to the company not being represented by a legally qualified advocate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. The public interest in the fair administration of justice may be prejudiced by the fact that <span class="font-italic">a lay advocate (unlike a legally qualified advocate) does not owe a duty to the court and to the parties in the litigation to ensure that the court is properly informed and not misled</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In light of these real and practical concerns, it is not difficult to see why the general prohibition against the lay representation of companies in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) of the ROC has not been completely abolished by recent amendments. If such a course had been adopted, it would, in my view, tilt the balance too heavily in favour of considerations of <span class="font-italic">access to justice</span> while at the same time neglecting the abovementioned concerns. ... Having conducted such an assessment [of whether leave should be given under O 1 r 9(2)], the court can then arrive at an informed view on whether it would, on a whole, be unduly prejudicial to the administration of justice if the lay representative is allowed to have carriage of the proceedings. Viewed in this way, the court can be said to perform an important sieving function under O 1 r 9(2).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, it is unfortunate that the present legal regime does not permit foreign bodies corporate the possibility of availing themselves of the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2). As a result, the court is also deprived of its “important sieving function” to grant leave (see <span class="font-italic">Bulk Trading </span>at [48]). We observe that such an outcome is neither pragmatic nor desirable in the context of <span class="font-italic">SICC matters</span>, which (as already mentioned at [22] above) almost always involve at least one party who is a foreign body corporate. The imposition of such an onerous requirement on these parties runs counter to the very objective of establishing the SICC in the first place, which is to grow the legal services sector and to expand the scope for the internationalisation and export of Singapore law (see [13] above). In the present appeal, for example, OWG’s lack of representation by a solicitor prevents the <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> merits of its oral submissions from being heard simply because OWG is <span class="font-italic">procedurally </span>prohibited from corporate self-representation and is also unable to apply for leave from the court to represent itself at the hearing before us. We highlight this issue as a gap or <span class="font-italic">lacuna</span> in the current legal regime governing corporate self-representation, and are of the view that this issue is sufficiently significant to merit consideration for the introduction of appropriate legislative amendments in the future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Accordingly, even though Cpt Koh applies to appear as an authorised representative on behalf of OWG at the hearing before us, OWG has failed to appear by an advocate and this court could exercise its discretion to dismiss the appeal pursuant to O 57 r 18(1) of the Rules, which provides that “[i]f on any day fixed for the hearing of an appeal, the appellant does not appear in person or by an advocate, the appeal <span class="font-italic">may</span> be dismissed” [emphasis added]. We do however observe that there is minimal prejudice against OWG in the present appeal for two reasons. First, at the hearing on 1 April 2020, in granting OWG’s adjournment, we expressly ordered that no further adjournments would be entertained, noting that the hearing of the appeal would be subject to the decision of the court as to whether the appeal can proceed if OWG is still not legally represented. Adequate and sufficient notice was given to OWG and, indeed, as a result of a further adjournment of this hearing, it was in fact granted <span class="font-italic">an additional</span><span class="font-italic"> period of slightly over two months </span>to secure legal representation. Second, in any event (and more importantly), given that we had, at the hearing itself, yet to decide the issue of corporate self-representation by foreign bodies corporate, we therefore permitted Cpt Koh to nevertheless proffer (in addition to the written submissions already tendered to this court) his oral submissions to us in fairness to OWG. Indeed, having considered the respective parties’ written and oral submissions, we are of the view that OWG’s appeal ought to be dismissed even on its merits, the reasons for which we now turn to briefly explain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Consideration Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 We begin with the issue of whether the OWG Guarantee was void as it was given for past consideration (“the Consideration Issue”). In the proceedings below, OWG argued that the OWG Guarantee was given for past consideration and was hence void. In our view, the Judge rightly rejected this argument and was correct in finding that there was, in fact, sufficient consideration in law for the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On appeal, OWG submitted that the OWG Guarantee was void because it was given for <span class="font-italic">past consideration</span> and that the express wording in paragraph 1 of the OWG Guarantee should be regarded as the best evidence of what parties saw was the consideration for the OWG Guarantee. However, as the Judge rightly observed, OWG’s reliance on the wording of the first paragraph of the OWG Guarantee is untenable and excessively technical. We agree with the Judge’s assessment that OWG’s proposed literal interpretation of the first paragraph of OWG Guarantee was devoid of commercial common sense. In our judgment, the first paragraph of the OWG Guarantee referred, instead, to the <span class="font-italic">continuing future</span> performance of the Original Charterparty instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Further, the Judge rightly took into account the circumstances under which the OWG Guarantee was issued. The contemporaneous evidence of the parties’ correspondence in October 2014 demonstrated that the parties had entered into the OWG Guarantee in order to secure the withdrawal of POSH’s call on the RBS Guarantee and the continued performance of the Charterparty. There was clear <span class="font-italic">legal</span> benefit and detriment from POSH’s forbearance to sue. This, in and of itself, renders OWG’s argument on past consideration a moot one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 At this juncture, it might nevertheless be apposite to make some observations on the doctrine of past consideration since it was canvassed in such a substantive manner by OWG. It is established that an act done before a promise and unconnected to the promise cannot be consideration for the promise because it is not done in <span class="font-italic">exchange</span> for the promise (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at para 04.011). That said, the past consideration rule does not simply look at strict chronology (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Sim Tony v Lim Ah Ghee (trading as</span><span class="font-italic"> Phil Real Estate &amp; Building Services)</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 886 at [16] and [21]). As observed by this court in <span class="font-italic">Rainforest Trading Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v State Bank of India Singapore </span>[2012] 2 SLR 713, a strictly chronological approach in determining whether consideration is past or not is deeply unrealistic and unnecessarily restrictive, and undermines the freedom of contracting parties as well as the sanctity of commercial transactions (at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Instead, what is crucial is the nexus between the act said to be consideration and the promise, and that the later act must be causally linked to the earlier promise. Therefore, the court’s inquiry is whether, at the time of the earlier act, a later promise was contemplated or required. If so, that connects the earlier act to the subsequent promise and establishes that they are part of the same transaction (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>at para 04.017). In the decision of <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”), this court further explained that the courts look to the substance rather than the form of the transaction. Hence, what looks at first blush like past consideration will still pass legal muster if there is, in effect, a single (contemporaneous) transaction (the common understanding of the parties being that consideration would indeed be furnished at the time the promisor made his or her promise to the promisee) (at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We turn now to the question of whether a promisee’s performance of an <span class="font-italic">existing</span> contractual obligation can be regarded as sufficient consideration. The traditional view is that it cannot, since the promisor obtains no benefit in law as it obtains nothing to which it was not already legally entitled and the promisee suffers no detriment for doing that he was already bound to do: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 4.042. However, the modern view accepts that performance of an existing contractual obligation can be good consideration. In the widely-cited decision of <span class="font-italic">Williams v Roffey Bros </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd </span>[1991] 1 QB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>”), the English Court of Appeal held that consideration need not be a legal benefit to the counterparty but could be a factual<span class="font-italic"> </span>or practical benefit obtained or detriment avoided (at least in so far as the situation concerns the promise to perform, or the actual performance of, an existing contractual duty owed to the same party). <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>has been cited and recognised in a number of Singapore cases, including the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Chee Vincent </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 250 at [9]–[13] and <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [70], as well as the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Teo Seng Kee Bob v </span><span class="font-italic">Arianecorp Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1114. Evidently, the Singapore courts adopt a liberal view in finding consideration. On the present facts, there was also <span class="font-italic">factual</span> or <span class="font-italic">practical</span> benefit to the Charterer which constituted valid consideration. As evident from the email dated 22 October 2014 from Ms Gariballa Ahmed, this benefit was in the form of keeping the commercial relationship between the Charterer and POSH strong and in maintaining the level of trust among the management of both companies. However, we note that it was not even necessary for POSH to rely on this strand of argument given what we have held above (at [38]). We should also observe that in the recent appeal to this court in <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd </span>Civil Appeal No 45 of 2019 (9 July 2020), an argument was made that the doctrine of consideration ought to be dispensed with in the context of contractual <span class="font-italic">variations</span>, which argument was <span class="font-italic">rejected</span> by the court (detailed grounds of judgment will delivered later). Put simply, the doctrine of consideration applies to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the formation <span class="font-italic">and</span> the variation of contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Accordingly, having examined the substance of the transaction and considered the existence of the arrangements that were concluded at about the same time at the end of October 2014 when the OWG Guarantee was given, namely, (a) the agreement to the payment plan; (b) the forbearance of POSH to sue or suspend the performance of the Charterparty; and (c) the withdrawal of the call on the RBS Guarantee, we are of the view that the Judge correctly found that there was sufficient consideration in law for the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We now turn to the other issues on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 First, we consider the issue as to whether the Post-Addendum Charterparty fell outside the general purview of the OWG Guarantee and whether OWG was consequently discharged from the OWG Guarantee upon signing the said Addendum on 15 November 2015. We do not find OWG’s submissions meritorious. We are of the view that the Judge correctly found that Addendum No 1 was merely a variation in the Original Charterparty that was not so fundamental as to take one outside the terms of the OWG Guarantee, despite having noted the significant changes to the existing charter. We also find that the present facts are sufficiently distinguishable from the case of <span class="font-italic">Melvin International</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Poseidon Schiffahrt GmbH (The “Kalma”)</span> [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 374.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Second, OWG’s submissions on appeal that the Judge had erred by holding that the Post-Addendum Charterparty was terminated at the point of withdrawal of the Vessel in accordance with cl 12 must be rejected. We agree with the Judge that POSH was entitled to terminate the Post-Addendum Charterparty. The parties’ correspondence from 16 February 2016 to 26 March 2016 evidenced the Charterer’s clear indication that it would not pay the outstanding charter hire despite POSH’s repeated demands. In our judgment, there was no wrongful termination as the requisite notice pursuant to cl 31(b) of the Post-Addendum Charterparty had been given from as early as 16 February 2016. As such, we reject OWG’s wrongful termination defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Third, we also agree with the Judge that, notwithstanding cll 3 and 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the obligations which arise under it do fall within the ambit of the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Fourth, we reject OWG’s argument that the RBS Guarantee was not intended to apply any dues under the Settlement Agreement. The RBS Guarantee most definitely fell within the ambit of cl 4 of the Settlement Agreement, which allowed POSH to “pursue recovery of the entire Outstanding Debt (or any part of balance thereof) through <span class="font-italic">any means</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>... ” [emphasis added]. Further, the Charterer had not provided any instructions to POSH on the manner in which the call proceeds should be appropriated, nor had the Charterer raised any objections to POSH’s setting off of the call proceeds against the aggregate amount set out in its letter to the Charterer dated 10 March 2016. POSH was entitled to set off the call proceeds against the chosen invoices that were listed in Appendix B of the Settlement Agreement, and the Charterer admitted in the Settlement Agreement that such sums were due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Fifth, OWG submitted that there was a discrepancy between the amount that the Second Commercial Circuit Court at the Seat of the Commercial Court of Dammam (“the Saudi Court”) had ordered the Charterer to pay POSH in relation to the Vessel on 17 May 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$2,812,904.26) in Case No 10029/3/Q, and the principal amount that the Judge had entered summary judgment for (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$3,306,446.50). It is well-established that a judgment or an award against a principal debtor is not binding on the guarantor and is not evidence against the guarantor in an action by the creditor against the guarantor based on the judgment or the award. Instead, should the creditor sue the guarantor, it must prove the guarantor’s liability in the same way as it must prove the principal debtor’s liability if it were to bring an action against the principal debtor (see <span class="font-italic">Ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte Young; In re Kitchin</span> (1881) 17 Ch D 668 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Kitchin</span>”) approved in the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia and another v Kristle Trading Ltd and another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 689 at [42]). We observe that the Judge had correctly found that POSH was not entitled to rely on the Saudi Court’s judgment against the Charterer as a basis to argue that OWG was similarly liable for the amounts ordered in the Saudi Court judgment in light of the <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Kitchin </span>principle. OWG had in fact accepted the application of this principle in the context of the Saudi Court’s findings on primary liability in its skeletal arguments. In the same vein, the amount that the Saudi Court had ordered the Charterer to pay POSH should not be in any way relevant to or binding on the principal amount that the Judge had entered summary judgment for in the court below. As a final point, we note a distinction between both proceedings before us and the Saudi Court. The Saudi Court made an order against <span class="font-italic">the Charterer</span>, while the present appeal pertains to a determination of liability against <span class="font-italic">OWG</span> premised upon its obligations under the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Sixth, OWG submitted that it was not liable for the interest amounts claimed by POSH under Invoice Nos 2008041 and 2008387 because the said invoices fell within the scope of the Settlement Agreement and that the levying of contractual interest was prohibited under Saudi Arabian law, given that Saudi Arabian law governed items falling within the Settlement Agreement pursuant to cl 12. However, such a submission must be rejected. While POSH and the Charterer may have entered into the <span class="font-italic">Settlement Agreement</span> governed by Saudi Arabian law, the fact remains that the claim against OWG was premised on the <span class="font-italic">OWG</span><span class="font-italic"> Guarantee</span>, which is governed by Singapore law pursuant to paragraph 15 of the OWG Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Last but not least, the Judge, in our view, correctly held that the indemnity provision in paragraph 4 of the OWG Guarantee was wide enough to include the interest on the claim and there was also no reason why the contractual provisions on the rate of interest set out in the Post-Addendum Charterparty should not be given effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 At the hearing on 5 August 2020, Cpt Koh informed the court that the Charterer had settled the sums due to POSH in relation to the Saudi Court proceedings, which also dealt with the primary liability issue in the present appeal. Cpt Koh argued that there should be no claim in the Singapore courts because payment had already been made to POSH. We reject such an argument for several reasons. First, POSH informed the court at the appeal hearing that as of 5 August 2020, no settlement had been reached between the parties and POSH had yet to receive any payment by the Charterer in relation to the order made by the Saudi Court. Second, we note that the present appeal deals solely with the <span class="font-italic">liability </span>of OWG, while any payment made by the Charterer to POSH in lieu of the Saudi Court proceedings is relevant only at the <span class="font-italic">enforcement </span>stage. Finally, Mr Chan provided (correctly, in our view) an undertaking at the hearing on 20 August 2020 that POSH would not be seeking double recovery in either jurisdiction at the enforcement stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For the reasons set out above, we dismiss the appeal in CA 180 and affirm the Judge’s findings on the Summary Judgment. Unless the parties are able to come to an agreement on costs, they are to furnish, within ten days from the date of this judgment, written submissions limited to five pages each, setting out their respective positions on the appropriate costs orders for the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong    Arjan Kumar Sikri     David Edmond Neuberger<br/>Judge of Appeal   International Judge    International Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Chen Tien as an authorised representative for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Tai-Hui Jason SC, Kek Meng Soon Kelvin, Oh Jialing Evangeline and Gan Yun Han Rebecca (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Any change in this regard must be made by way of the appropriate legislative amendments: at <strong>[32]</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Background facts</strong></p> <ul><li>1The Respondent, POSH Semco Ltd (“POSH”), applied for (i) summary judgment against the Appellant, Offshoreworks Global (L) Limited (“OWG”), for the sum of S$4,078,226.48 with interest and costs; and (ii) a declaration that a guarantee issued by OWG to POSH was an “on-demand performance guarantee” under SIC/Summons No 50 of 2019 (“SUM 50”). </li><li>2OWG and the first defendant in SUM 50, Makamin Petroleum Services Co (“MPS”), are shareholders of Makamin Offshore Saudi Ltd (“the Charterer”), with OWG being the majority shareholder. Captain Koh Chen Tien (“Cpt Koh”) is OWG’s sole shareholder and Executive Director, and was also the Managing Director of the Charterer at the material time. </li><li>3On 28 October 2013, the Charterer entered into a time charterparty (“the Original Charterparty”) with POSH in relation to the vessel “POSH Pelican” (“the Vessel”) on the terms of a BIMCO Supplytime 2005 standard contract and additional clauses. Pursuant to cl 41 of the Original Charterparty, the Charterer provided a bank guarantee to POSH for US$1.293m which was issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, plc (“the RBS Guarantee”).</li><li>4As of 17 October 2014, POSH claimed that the Charterer owed POSH a sum of over US$3.7m pursuant to the Original Charterparty. The Charterer sought to persuade POSH to withdraw its call on the RBS Guarantee. POSH agreed to do so, provided that OWG (and three other parties related to the Charterer) furnish guarantees to POSH for the purpose of securing performance of the Charterer’s obligations under the Original Charterparty. On 24 October 2014, multiple guarantees by OWG, MPS, Cpt Koh and Dr Abdullah Aseeri Ali were signed with reference to the Original Charterparty. Of particular significance was the OWG Guarantee issued by OWG in favour of POSH, which provided that OWG “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee[d] … the due and faithful performance by the Charterer of all its obligations contained in the Supplytime 2005”. </li><li>5On 15 November 2015, the Charterer and POSH entered into a settlement agreement in relation to the outstanding debt (“the Settlement Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement set out the parties’ agreement on, <em>inter alia</em>, (a) the Charterer’s outstanding debt under the Original Charterparty of US$2,891,241.54 as of 30 June 2015 (“the Outstanding Debt”); (b) the Charterer’s payment plan to POSH with regard to the settlement sum of US$2,119,461.56 in eight monthly instalments over a period between November 2015 and June 2016 (“the Settlement Sum”) in full and final settlement and discharge of any and all past or present claims that POSH had against the Charterer; (c) the Original Charterparty, as amended by Addendum No 1 of the Settlement Agreement (collectively referred to as “the Post-Addendum Charterparty”); and (d) that in the event that any of the eight instalments was not paid by the stipulated timeline, the entire Outstanding Debt would immediately become payable.</li><li>6On 26 March 2016, POSH withdrew its vessel and terminated the Charterparty for the Charterer’s alleged repudiatory breach in accordance with the three-day notification period under the early termination clause of the Post-Addendum Charterparty. <p> </p><p><strong>The Judge’s decision</strong></p></li><li>7In SUM 50, the Judge held that (a) summary judgment be entered in favour of POSH against OWG for the sum of US$3,306.446.50 with interest and costs (“the Summary Judgment”); and (b) OWG be granted unconditional leave to defend POSH’s claim for the remaining amount of US$771,779.98, being the difference between the 30 June 2015 Outstanding Debt and the Settlement Sum. <p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The Court of Appeal’s decision</strong></p></li><li>8The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Judge’s finding on the Summary Judgment.<p><strong><em>Preliminary issue of corporate self-representation by foreign bodies corporate</em></strong></p></li><li>9The Court of Appeal held that the governing provisions that foreign bodies corporate in all proceedings before the SICC as well as in all appeals from the SICC (collectively referred to as “SICC matters”) must be represented by a solicitor. As the leave mechanism pursuant to O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) did not apply to foreign bodies corporate, this possible legal route for corporate self-representation was unavailable to a party which was a foreign body corporate: at <strong>[22]</strong>.</li><li>10Under the present legal regime, the prohibitions against corporate self-representation in O 5 r 6(2) and O 12 r 1(2) of the Rules did apply to SICC matters and that the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules was not available to foreign bodies corporate appearing in SICC matters as a possible legal avenue for corporate self-representation with leave of court. There were limits to the manner in which given provisions (here, rules of court) could be interpreted. The Court of Appeal could not effectively rewrite the relevant rules in order to achieve what it perceived would be a just and fair result: at <strong>[32]</strong>.</li><li>11The Court of Appeal observed that it was unfortunate that the present legal regime did not permit foreign bodies corporate the possibility of availing themselves of the leave mechanism in O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules and that such an outcome was neither pragmatic nor desirable in the context of SICC matters, which almost always involved at least one party who is a foreign body corporate. The Court of Appeal highlighted this issue as a gap or lacuna in the current legal regime governing corporate self-representation, and were of the view that this issue was sufficiently significant to merit consideration for the introduction of appropriate legislative amendments in the future: at <strong>[34]</strong>.<p><strong><em>Merits of the appeal</em></strong></p></li><li>12The Court of Appeal held that in any case, OWG’s appeal ought to be dismissed even on its merits: at <strong>[35]</strong>. </li><li>13Having examined the substance of the transaction and considered the existence of the arrangements that were concluded at about the same time at the end of October 2014 when the OWG Guarantee was given, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge’s finding that there was sufficient consideration in law for the OWG Guarantee: at <strong>[42]</strong>. </li><li>14The Court of Appeal held that the Judge correctly found that Addendum No 1 of the Settlement Agreement was merely a variation in the Original Charterparty that was not so fundamental as to take one outside the terms of the OWG Guarantee, despite having noted the significant changes to the existing charter. There was also no wrongful termination as the requisite notice pursuant to cl 31(b) of the Post-Addendum Charterparty had been given from as early as 16 February 2016. The Court of Appeal also agreed with the Judge that, notwithstanding cll 3 and 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the obligations which arise under it did fall within the ambit of the OWG Guarantee: at <strong>[44]–[46].</strong> </li><li>15The Court of Appeal rejected OWG’s argument that the RBS Guarantee was not intended to apply any dues under the Settlement Agreement. The Court of Appeal also held that the amount that the Second Commercial Circuit Court at the Seat of the Commercial Court of Dammam (“the Saudi Court”) had ordered the Charterer to pay POSH should not be in any way relevant to or binding on the principal amount that the Judge had entered summary judgment for in the court below. Further, the Court of Appeal rejected OWG’s submission that it was not liable for the interest amounts claimed by POSH under Invoice Nos 2008041 and 2008387 because the claim against OWG was premised on the OWG Guarantee, which was governed by Singapore law pursuant to paragraph 15 of the OWG Guarantee. The Court of Appeal also agreed with the Judge’s holding that the indemnity provision in paragraph 4 of the OWG Guarantee was wide enough to include the interest on the claim and there was also no reason why the contractual provisions on the rate of interest set out in the Post-Addendum Charterparty should not be given effect. Finally, the Court of Appeal rejected OWG’s argument that there should be no claim in the Singapore courts because the Charterer had allegedly settled the sums due to POSH in relation to the Saudi Court proceedings. However, no settlement had in fact been reached between the parties and as of 5 August 2020, POSH had yet to receive any payment by the Charterer in relation to the order made by the Saudi Court. In this regard, the Court of Appeal also noted that the present appeal dealt solely with the <em>liability</em> of OWG, while any payment made by the Charterer to POSH in lieu of the Saudi Court proceedings was relevant only at the <em>enforcement </em>stage. It further noted that counsel for POSH had provided an undertaking at the hearing that POSH would not be seeking double recovery in either jurisdiction at the enforcement stage: at <strong>[47]–[51]</strong>.</li></ul> <p> </p> <p><em>This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
