<p align="justify" xmlns="">
<font face="Times New Roman">(1) The judgment in <i>Good Property Land

Development Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Societe-Generale</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=32861&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 2 SLR 239</a> has decided

that under s 41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act, contingent claims are not capable of

being the subject of set-off (as seems to be the case), then, the applicable s 88(1) under

the existing Bankruptcy Act had changed the position and it allows the Defendants’

claims for liquidated damages to be set-off against the contingent claims of the Vendor

which have now matured into claims against the Defendants ( 88). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(2) In this instance, the right of set-off

for late delivery of possession is contractually provided for in cl 11(4) of the Sale

&amp; Purchase Agreement (S&amp;P). The liquidator had carried on with the S&amp;Ps. It

was said that he used the resources of the company to achieve the stages under cll 3(1)(g)

and (h). The fact is that he has carried on with the S&amp;Ps. Having done so, he could

not, in the court's view, claim the benefits under the S&amp;Ps and yet disclaim the

burdens under them. He cannot choose which terms of the S&amp;Ps would continue to apply

to him and which would not ( 94). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(3) Another special feature of the case is

that cl 11(4) of the S&amp;P is part of a set of standard terms prescribed by subsidiary

legislation ie the Housing Developers Rules 1985. It is quite clear that cl 11(4) of the

S&amp;P is to protect the interest of purchasers like the Defendants, see Rules 15(1) and

(2). If monies have already been paid under cl 3 of the S&amp;P, they would have to be

paid into the Project Account first. The liquidator would then use the moneys for any of

the authorised purposes and thereafter have to use it to pay to the purchaser liquidated

damages that may arise before making any payment to unsecured creditors, in so far as

their claims do not come under s 9(6)(a). In the present case, the Defendants do not have

to pay first because of cl 11(4) of the S&amp;P. However, if they happened to pay first,

their claim for liquidated damages would still rank ahead of unsecured creditors. Even if

the liquidator does not require the monies called for to complete the project or to comply

with other obligations under the S&amp;P, this does not mean that the interest of the

unsecured creditors negates the right of purchasers to the set-off claimed. As regards the

argument for the liquidator that to refuse the set-off would not put purchasers in a worse

position because they would be treated like other unsecured creditors, this would not be a

valid argument. Purchasers are not supposed to be treated like other unsecured creditors.

To do so would put them in a worse position than that envisaged under the Housing

Developers legislation and the bankruptcy legislation ( 109, 113, 120-123, 126).</font></p>

<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">BACKGROUND</font></p>
<p></p></i></b><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">1.        

Panorama Development Pte Ltd (‘the Vendor’) is the developer of a housing

project known as Chateau Le Fame at Ewe Boon Road (‘the Project’).</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.        Each of the

Defendants is a purchaser of a unit in the Project. There are other purchasers of units in

the Project in the same position as the Defendants. Accordingly the outcome of this action

would affect the position of those other purchasers vis--vis the Vendor which is in

liquidation. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.        Each of the

Defendants entered into a sale and purchase agreement (‘the S&amp;P’) with the

Vendor. The terms of each S&amp;P are alike. In fact, the S&amp;P is prescribed by Rule

12(2) and Form E of the Schedule to the Housing Developers Rules 1985 (as amended from

time to time) which were made pursuant to the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing)

Act (Cap 130) (‘the Housing Developers Act’).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.        The dates of

the S&amp;Ps are 12 April 1995 (for the First Defendant) and 21 June 1996 (for the Second

Defendant). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.        Clauses

3(1)(a) to (i) of the S&amp;P provides for the purchase price to be paid in instalments on

the occurrence of each event specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (i).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.        Clause 11(1)

of the S&amp;P imposes an obligation on the Vendor to deliver vacant possession of the

unit purchased by 31 December 1997 and cl 11(2) stipulates how this is done. They state:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘11(1) The Vendor shall complete the

  building unit so as to be fit for occupation and remove all surplus material, plant and

  rubbish from the building unit and the housing project and deliver vacant possession of

  the building unit to the Purchaser on or before the 31st day of December 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) On delivery of vacant possession of

  the building unit to the Purchaser, the Vendor shall deliver to the Purchaser or his

  solicitors a copy of the Temporary Occupation Permit or Certificate of Statutory

  Completion for occupation of the building unit issued by the Building Authority together

  with the certificate of the Vendor’s architect that the building unit and the housing

  project and all roads and drainage and sewerage works of the housing project have been

  constructed in accordance with the plans specifications approved by the Building Authority

  and that water and electricity supplies have been duly connected to the building

  unit.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.        Clause 11(3)

of the S&amp;P provides for liquidated damages to be payable by the Vendor if the Vendor

fails to meet the deadline in cl 11(1). Clause 11(4) allows such liquidated damages to be

deducted from any instalment due and payable to the Vendor. They state:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(3) If the Vendor fails or is unable

  to deliver vacant possession of the building unit to the Purchaser on the date specified

  in paragraph (1) of this clause for any reason whatsoever, the Vendor shall pay to the

  Purchaser liquidated damages calculated from day to day at the rate of ten (10) per cent

  per annum on the total sum of all the instalments paid by the Purchaser towards the

  purchase price for the period commencing immediately after the date specified in paragraph

  (1) of this Clause and ending on the date vacant possession of the building unit is

  delivered to the Purchaser.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) Any liquidated damages payable to the

  Purchaser under this Clause may be deducted from any instalment due and payable to the

  Vendor.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.        It is common

ground that the Vendor failed to meet the deadline of 31 December 1997.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.        It is also

common ground that, subsequently, a winding up petition against the Vendor was filed on 20

July 1999 whereupon an order to, inter alia, wind up the Vendor and appoint a liquidator

was made on 3 September 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.        Prior to the

date of the winding up order and prior to the date of the filing of the winding up

petition, the Defendants had made payments up to and including cl 3(1)(f) of the S&amp;P.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.        Also as at

the date of the winding up order as well as the date of the filing of the winding up

petition, liquidated damages were due and payable by the Vendor to the Defendants and

continued to accrue. However as at that date no instalment was due and payable by the

Defendants to the Vendor.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.        On 17

September 1999, the liquidator obtained an order to allow him to engage the main

contractor to complete the Project.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.        Pursuant

thereto, cl 3(1)(g) and cl 3(1)(h) of the S&amp;P were achieved.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.        The

liquidator or his solicitors then sought payment by giving notice under cl 3(1)(g) on 22

October 1999 and under cl 3(1)(h) on 4 March 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.        Clause

3(1)(h) is more significant as that is the stage when notice is given to each Defendant to

take possession of the unit purchased i.e. compliance with cl 11(1) of the S&amp;P read

with cl 11(2). Clause 3(1)(h) states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(h) Within fourteen (14) days after

  receipt by the Purchaser of the Vendor’s notice to take possession and a photographic

  copy of the Temporary Occupation Permit issued by the Building Authority certified as a

  true copy of the Vendor’s solicitors together with the Certificate of the

  Vendor’s architect that the building unit and all roads, and drainage and sewerage

  works serving the housing project have been completed and that water and electricity

  supplies have been duly connected to the building unit, a sum equal to twenty-five (25)

  per cent of the purchase price; ’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.        The

Defendants did not pay the full instalments required of them. They took the position that

they were entitled to deduct the liquidated damages from the instalments claimed and paid

the balance.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.        The

liquidator has taken out this action essentially to seek a determination as to whether the

Defendants are entitled to set-off the liquidated damages against the payment of any

instalment to be paid by them subsequent to the date of the filing of the winding up

petition and the date of the winding up order.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.        After

hearing arguments, I decided that the Defendants are entitled to set-off the liquidated

damages both before and after each of these dates against any instalment to be paid by

them. The liquidator is appealing against my decision.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THE BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.        Section

327(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(2) Subject to section 328, in the

  winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with

  claims against the company as they respectively are entitled to by virtue of this

  section.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.        Although s

327(2) is subject to s 328 of the Companies Act, s 328 is not relevant for present

purposes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.        Also, in the

context of companies, a determination may sometimes have to be made as to which date is

the equivalent of the date of the bankruptcy order made under the applicable Bankruptcy

Act (Cap 20) i.e. the date of the filing of the winding up petition or the date of the

winding up order. For present purposes, it is not necessary for me to determine which of

the two dates is the equivalent to the date of the bankruptcy order as the material facts

as at each date are the same. I will refer to the equivalent date as ‘the relevant

date’ </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.        The relevant

provision in the applicable Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) is s 88(1) which deals with mutual

credit and set-off. More will be said about this provision later.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.        

Notwithstanding s 88(1) of the applicable Bankruptcy Act, Counsel for the liquidator

submitted that the Defendants are not entitled to set-off the liquidated damages against

the instalments to be paid. He relied primarily on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Good

Property Land Development Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Societe-Generale </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=32861&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 2 SLR 239</a>

(‘the <i>Good Property</i> case’).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.        In the <i>Good

Property</i> case, a company Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd (‘GPLD’) had

sought to develop two plots of land (‘the Properties’). It applied for and

obtained a syndicated loan from various banks. Societe Generale (‘SG’) was the

lead manager and agent of the syndicated loan. The loan was secured, inter alia, by a

mortgage over the Properties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.        However, SG

had also lent some monies to GPLD which were not secured by the mortgage.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.        On 12

November 1988, SG exercised their power of sale under the mortgage and sold the

Properties. Completion was effected on 4 February 1989. The proceeds of sale were more

than sufficient to pay the secured debt.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.        Accordingly,

after paying the secured debt, SG kept the surplus to pay GPLD’s debts to it which

were unsecured.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.        On 29 June

1989, SG filed a petition to wind up GPLD and on 28 July 1989, GPLD was ordered to be

wound up and liquidators were appointed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.        On various

dates after completion, SG purported to set-off the surplus against the debts owing to it

by GPLD.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.        The

liquidators then commenced an action to recover the surplus, in so far as GPLD had not

earlier consented to the set-off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.        SG argued

that it was entitled to a set-off under the mutual credit and set-off provision of the

then Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20). This was before major changes were made to bankruptcy

legislation by a new Bankruptcy Act which came into effect on 15 July 1995. I will refer

to the prior Bankruptcy Act as ‘the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act’ and the Bankruptcy

Act applicable as at the relevant date as ‘the applicable Bankruptcy Act’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.        The

liquidators argued that SG was not entitled to a set-off under that provision as there was

no mutuality for two reasons.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.        First, SG

was obliged to apply the monies received from its exercise of its power of sale in

accordance with s 68(1) Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1985 Ed) which states:</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.        The

trustee and therefore it could not set-off the surplus against the monies owing to it in

its own capacity.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.        Secondly, SG

was not even holding the surplus for itself but as agent of the syndicated banks who were

the true mortgagees and who were liable in law to give effect to s 68(1) of the Land

Titles Act. Accordingly, again, there was no mutuality which would entitle SG to set-off

the surplus against monies owing to it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.        The Court of

Appeal allowed the appeal of the liquidators but on different grounds.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.        At p 246E to

F of the report, the Court of Appeal said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘We think that whether the surplus

  funds were held for the mortgagor or all subsequent encumbrancers, one position is

  undoubted and it is this: the proceeds of sale were held on trust but the right of the

  mortgagor to any residue will only crystallize or, to phrase it in another way, the

  beneficial interest will only become clear and ascertained after all prior encumbrancers

  are paid. This is part of the wider principle that for mutuality to exist, two conditions

  must generally be satisfied. First, each claimant must be personally liable for the debt

  he owes to the other claimant. Mutuality sees through to the real beneficial ownership,

  regardless of who is the legal, nominal, titular or procedural holder of the claim or

  procedurally the appropriate plaintiff. Secondly, each claimant must beneficially own the

  claim which is owed to him by the other claimant and his ownership interest in that claim

  must be clear and ascertained without inquiry.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The second condition is most pertinent to

  our present case. We think that the most obvious rationale for this condition is that

  there must be no real risk of one person’s claim being used to pay another’s

  liability: see <i>Jones v Mossop</i> (1844) 3 Hare 568; 67 ER 506 at p 574. This rationale

  also forms the underlying principle on which mutuality is based. A set-off might involve

  the use of property to pay a debt where that property or part of it was allocated to the

  payment of prior creditors or to the payment of other beneficiaries, as under a mortgage

  trust. The following case, though not involving a mortgage trust, is illustrative of this

  rationale. In <i>Bishop v Church</i> (1748) 3 Atk 691; 26 ER 1197, a beneficiary of a will

  trust owed a loan to a bank and the bank in turn owed a credit balance to the trustee of

  the trust in which the beneficiary had an interest. As the estate was not fully

  administered, it was held that there could be no set-off because, if the bank were to set

  off the beneficiary’s loan against the credit balance, this might involve the credit

  balance being used to pay the beneficiary’s private loan in circumstances where the

  credit balance, or part of it, should be allocated to the payment of creditors entitled to

  pari passu payment out of the trust fund and to other beneficiaries. The size of the

  interest of the beneficiary in the credit balance would only appear on completion of the

  administration of the estate when all prior creditors and other beneficiaries had been

  paid (also see <i>Re Willis Percival &amp; Co, ex p Morier</i> [1879] 12 Ch D 491 and <i>Phillips

  v Howell</i> (1901) 2 Ch 773). The same rationale could also apply, <i>mutatis mutandi</i>,

  to the present case of a mortgage trust. The mortgagor, GPLD, had a beneficial interest in

  the proceeds of sale which only became clear and ascertainable after all the relevant

  payments were made. It was only at this point that mutuality could exist. In the event

  that no surplus was left thereafter, then no interest would ever crystallize.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In our opinion, once it was established

  that GPLD did not have a clear and ascertained interest in the surplus funds under items

  20 and 21 before the commencement of winding-up, the matter was not so much whether trust

  moneys could be set-off. Rather, the issue to consider was when such an interest

  crystallized. And when it finally did, was it too late for a right of set-off to exist? In

  particular, we were concerned as to whether the surplus funds, when crystallized, would

  vest in GPLD or the liquidators since this was an issue that went towards mutuality. The

  right of set-off cannot encompass amounts paid to the credit of the insolvent

  customer’s account after the commencement of the winding-up. Such amounts are not

  funds deposited to the credit of the bank’s customer but are funds belonging to the

  liquidator (see <i>Re West Bay Sales Ltd</i> (1979) 30 CBR (NS) 274 at p 280).’</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.        After citing

a passage from <i>Re DW McIntosh Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada</i> [1940] 3 DLR 782 at p 785,

the Court of Appeal said, at p 248:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Likewise in <i>Re S Piscione &amp;

  Sons Ltd</i> [1965] 1 OR 515, following the debtor’s bankruptcy, the mortgagee

  realized the mortgage and sought to set off the surplus proceeds against unsecured

  indebtedness. No set-off was allowed due to the lack of mutuality as the debtor was

  indebted to the creditor and the creditor to the trustee in bankruptcy. Had the mortgage

  been realized before the bankruptcy, that would have made all the difference. Smily J

  held, at p 520-521, as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">With respect to the second issue, whether

    United [the chattel mortgagee] is entitled to apply any surplus realized from the sale of

    equipment covered by either or both of the chattel mortgages against the unsecured account

    owing to it by Piscione, this, of course, depends on whether United is entitled to set-off

    any surplus against the unsecured account. There does not appear to be any question apart

    from the rule of set-off, that United would not be entitled to apply such surplus against

    the other account. For such right of set-off to apply, there must of course be mutuality

    of debts. In the instant case this does not exist. At the time the trustee is entitled to

    receive the surplus from United, there is no indebtedness to be set off. The trustee is

    not indebted to United.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The cases referred to by counsel for

    United were all cases where the mutual debt arose before the assignment in bankruptcy,

    including the case of <i>Stephens v Boisseau</i> (1896) 26 SCR 437, much relied upon by

    said counsel. <i>Under the Bankruptcy Act, RSC 1952 (c 14) s 41(5), all the property of

    Piscione, the chattel mortgagor vests in the trustee and this of course would include any

    equity in the property covered by the chattel mortgage. So that while the unsecured

    account of United was against the estate of the bankrupt and not against the trustee, the

    indebtedness of United was a debt to the trustee. There is therefore no mutuality of

    debts, so the right of set-off does not apply and United was not entitled to apply any

    surplus realized from the sale of the equipment covered by either or both of the chattel

    mortgages against the unsecured account owing to it by the bankrupt. </i>The liability or

    debt of United for the surplus did not arise until after the bankruptcy, which

    distinguishes it from the case of <i>Stephens v Boisseau</i> and other cases mentioned by

    counsel for United. [Emphasis added.]</font></p>

same company but between two banks, Arab Banking Corp (‘ABC’) and United

Overseas Bank Ltd (‘UOB’), who were creditors of an individual Sng Hock Seng

(‘Sng’).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.        Sng was the

beneficial owner of a property which was mortgaged to UOB to secure a debt owing by one

Sim Lek Tee (‘Sim’) in whose name the property was registered.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.        Eventually

City Securities (Pte) had financial difficulties and ABC called on the guarantee from Sng.

As Sng did not pay on the guarantee, ABC initiated action and obtained judgment against

him on 31 July 1986. ABC then obtained a charging order nisi on the property on 7 August

1986. On 3 October 1986, ABC obtained a charging order absolute and on 10 October 1986, it

obtained an order to appoint a receiver over the property.</font></p>

1986 or thereabouts, Sim was in default of payment of monies to UOB. On 21 October 1986,

UOB exercised its power of sale and the sale was completed on 22 January 1987. After

applying the proceeds of sale to pay Sim’s liability, there was a surplus. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.        UOB wanted

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.        ABC claimed

the surplus on the ground that that it held a charge on the property in view of the

charging orders it had obtained. Therefore, ABC contended that it was a subsequent

encumbrancer and UOB was a trustee of the surplus and was obliged to pay it to ABC under s

26(3) of the then Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61) 1985 Edition. Section

orders before the date of the receiving order against Sng because ABC had not completed

its sale of the property by receiving the proceeds of sale. It will be recalled that UOB

was the one who had sold the property and was hanging onto the surplus. Accordingly, as

ABC had not completed its sale prior to the receiving order, UOB’s argument was that

ABC could not obtain the benefit of its charging orders under s 49 of the pre-1995

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.        The Court of

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.        Under s 49,

a creditor could not retain the benefit of its execution against the Official Assignee if

it had not completed the execution before the date of the receiving order. However, the

Official Assignee was not a party to the action and there was nothing in the pre-1995

Bankruptcy Act to deny ABC the benefit of its charging orders as between ABC and UOB or to

prevent the trust imposed under s 26(3) of the CLPA from arising.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.        It was in

that context that the Court of Appeal in the <i>Arab Banking</i> case said that the

surplus did not belong to Sng (but to ABC) and no question of set-off arose. The Court of

Appeal in that case did not say that because the receiving order had already been made,

the surplus vested in the Official Assignee and hence there could be no set-off as between

UOB and the Official Assignee.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.        Coming back

to the decision of the Court of Appeal in the <i>Good Property</i> case, there is an

article by Mr Lee Eng Beng on it. His article is entitled ‘Trust Funds,

Ascertainability of Beneficial Interest and Insolvency Set-Off’ (1966) 8 S. AcLJ 489.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.        At p 494 to

496 he says,</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘<b>The requirement of

  ascertainability</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Court of Appeal is quite correct

  in stating that, in order for set-off to apply, each claimant must, at the relevant date,

  beneficially own the claim which is owed to him by the other claimant. However, the

  subsequent proposition that, at that date, his ownership interest in the claim must also

  be clear and ascertained without inquiry raises some interesting questions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Court, in formulating the latter

  proposition, appears to have derived substantial assistance from Wood’s treatise. But

  it is respectfully submitted, as recognised by Derham, that the rule is in fact one which

  applies only in the special context of executors and administrators. The cases relied on

  by Wood and the Court merely establish that the claim of a legatee to sums comprised in a

  deceased’s estate cannot be set off, during the currency of administration, against

  his personal liability owed to a debtor of the estate; there is no mutuality since the

  claim of the estate does not beneficially belong to the legatee. This is because of the

  distinctive rule that, while a deceased’s estate is in administration, the persons

  entitled to the estate under the will or according to the laws of intestacy have no

  beneficial interest in the estate. They only have a right to have the estate properly

  administered. While the estate is being administered, it is impossible to identify the

  person in whom the beneficial ownership of any particular asset forming part of the estate

  is vested, and it is in this sense that it is said that he does not have a clear and

  ascertained beneficial interest in the estate. Accordingly, the requirement is really

  another facet of the rule that the parties to the set-off must, at the relevant date,

  beneficially own the claims purported to be set off. It relates to the <i>existence </i>of

  the beneficial interest, not its <i>quantification</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">That this is the correct analysis is

  supported by the rule that contingent and unliquidated claims may be set off. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">And the House of Lords recently held that

  a claim for damages for breach of contract and a counter-claim for damages for

  misrepresentation, both of which are unliquidated at the relevant date, will be

  automatically set off at the relevant date such that only the net balance of the two

  claims is left owing [citing <i>Stein v Blake</i> [1995] 2 WLR 710J]. The uncertainty in

  the quantification of a claim should never defeat set-off, as long as the claim is an

  existing one at the relevant date. Furthermore, it has long been recognised that, as long

  as a debt is provable, it is capable of being set off (provided the other requirements are

  made). It would be contrary to this rule to hold that only claims the quantum of which at

  the relevant date are ‘clear and unascertainable without inquiry’ may be set

  off, since it is statutorily provided that a claim is provable even if it is unliquidated

  or contingent at the date of the winding up order.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">….</font></p>
<b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The vesting of the claim in the

  liquidator</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The final comment is with regard to

  the Court of Appeal’s statements to the effect that a claim of a company which arises

  after the commencement of winding up is not capable of being set off as it vests in the

  liquidator and not the company. These statements appear to equate the effect of bankruptcy

  on a bankrupt’s assets with the effect of winding up on a company’s assets. But

  one of the key differences between bankruptcy and winding up is that in bankruptcy the

  whole estate is taken out of the bankrupt and is vested in his trustee, whereas in a

  winding up the legal estate still remains in the company. In a winding up, there is no

  transfer of the company’s property to the liquidator whose duty is merely to take

  into custody and take control of the company’s property. This is also implicit in the

  terms of section 269 of the Companies Act. As such, a claim acquired by the company never

  vests in the liquidator, regardless of the date of acquisition, unless the Court expressly

  makes an order to that effect. The cases which hold to the contrary and which were relied

  on by the Court were <i>Canadian</i> cases - a feature of the Canadian bankruptcy regime,

  which is not found in the local model (or in that of England and Australia), is that it

  applies to corporations as well as individuals. In Canada, a receiving order may be made

  against a corporation, whereupon a trustee in bankruptcy would be appointed as trustee of

  the corporation’s property.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, it is correct to say that a

  claim of the company which arises after the date of the winding up order is not capable of

  being set off. But this is due to another reason: the operation of set-off is automatic

  and self-executing at that date and only the net balance of the mutual claims remains in

  existence. Set-off operates only on the mutual claims existing at the date of the winding

  up order.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.        In Mr

Lee’s article, he considers that the relevant date as to when to consider mutual

debts is the date of the winding up order and not the date of the filing of the winding up

petition. As I have said, for present purposes, it is not necessary for me to determine

which is the relevant date.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.        In the

present case before me, Counsel for the liquidator argued that the Defendants were not

entitled to set-off the liquidated damages they were entitled to claim against the

payments due from them under cll 3(1)(g) and 3(1)(h) of the S&amp;P because as at the

relevant date, the monies to be paid by the Defendants under cll 3(1)(g) and 3(1)(h) were

not clear or ascertainable. This was because it was not clear then whether the liquidator

would carry on with the Project and therefore the actual sum of monies payable to the

liquidator was not clear or ascertainable.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.        If I were

not bound by authority, I would be of the view that the difficulty of quantifying the

monies owing to the liquidator cannot deny the Defendants from relying on the mutual

credit and set-off provision under s 41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act for the reasons

mentioned in Mr Lee’s article. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.        I would also

41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.        At p 713 to

  other mutual dealings before the bankruptcy for which a creditor would be entitled to

  prove as a "bankruptcy debt". This is defined by section 382 of the Insolvency

  the law says that the account shall be deemed to have been taken and the sums due from one

  party set off against the other as at the date of the bankruptcy. This is in accordance

  with the general principle of bankruptcy law, which governs payment of interest,

  conversion of foreign currencies etc., that the debts of the bankrupt are treated as

  having been ascertained and his assets simultaneously distributed among his creditors on

  the bankruptcy date: see <i>In re Dynamics Corporation of America </i>[1976] 1 W.L.R. 757,

  762. It is clear, therefore, that when section 323(2) speaks of taking an account of what

  is "due" from each party, it does not mean that the sums in question must have

  been due and payable, whether at the bankruptcy date or even the date when the calculation

  falls to be made. The claims may have been contingent at the bankruptcy date and the

  creditor’s claim against the bankrupt may remain contingent at the time of the

  calculation, but they are nevertheless included in the account. I consider next how this

  is done.</font></p>
<i><p></p></i><font face="Times New Roman">6.    <i>Quantifying the

  cross-claims</i></font>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">How does the law deal with the

  conundrum of having to set off, as of the bankruptcy date, "sums due" which may

  not yet be due or which may become owing upon contingencies which have not yet occurred?

  It employs two techniques. The first is to take into account everything which has actually

  happened between the bankruptcy date and the moment which it becomes necessary to

  ascertain what, on that date, was the state of account between the creditor and the

  bankrupt. If by that time the contingency has occurred and the claim has been quantified,

  then that is the amount which is treated as having been due at the bankruptcy date . An

  example is <em>Sovereign Life Assurance Co. v. Dodd</em> [1892] 2 Q.B. 573, in which the

  insurance company had lent Mr. Dodd 1,170 on the security of his policies. The company

  was wound up before the policies had matured but Mr. Dodd went on paying the premiums

  until they became payable. The Court of Appeal held that the account required by

  bankruptcy set-off should set off the full matured value of the policies against the loan.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">       

  But the winding up of the estate of a bankrupt or an insolvent company cannot always wait

  until all possible contingencies have happened and all the actual or potential liabilities

  which existed at the bankruptcy date have been quantified. Therefore the law adopts a

  second technique, which is to make an estimation of the value of the claim. Section 322(3)

  says:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The trustee shall estimate the value

    of any bankruptcy debt which, by reason of its being subject to any contingency or

    contingencies or for any other reason, does not bear a certain value."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This enables the trustee to quantify a

  creditor’s contingent or unascertained claim, for the purposes of set-off or proof,

  in a way which will enable the trustee safely to distribute the estate, even if subsequent

  events show that the claim was worth more. There is no similar machinery for quantifying

  contingent or unascertained claims <i>against</i> the creditor, because it would be unfair

  upon him to have his liability to pay advanced merely because the trustee wants to wind up

  the bankrupt’s estate.’</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.        I would add

that the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act and the applicable Bankruptcy Act also have provisions

for the quantum of contingent claims of a creditor to be estimated.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.        Counsel for

the liquidator had another argument. He argued that, as at the relevant date, there was

nothing for the Defendants to set-off against because no claim had yet been made under cll

3(1)(g) and 3(1)(h) of the S&amp;Ps.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.        The comments

of Mr Lee Eng Beng in his article seem to support this argument, eg. at p 496 of the

journal, he says:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The uncertainty in the

  quantification of a claim should never defeat set-off, as long as the claim is an existing

  one at the relevant date.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.        At p 497 he

says:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Nevertheless it is correct to say

  that a claim of the company which arises after the date of the winding up order is not

  capable of being set-off.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.        Mr Lee

appears to rely on <i>Stein v Blake</i> for this proposition. In my view, <i>Stein v Blake</i>

is not authority for this proposition. On the contrary that case recognises that a

contingent claim may be set-off against an existing claim. A contingent claim is one which

may or may not arise but its basis i.e. the contract from which it may or may not arise,

exists as at the relevant date.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66.        Furthermore,

Mr Lee’s assertion that a claim which arises after the relevant date is not capable

of being set-off seems to run counter to his other assertion that contingent claims may be

set-off. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.        The

liquidator’s Counsel relied on two other cases in support of his argument: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    The Ince Hall Rolling Mills

  Company Limited v The Douglas Forge Company </font></p></i>(1882) 8 QBD 179, and

  <i><p></p></i><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    <i>P.Lyall &amp; Sons

  Construction Co. Ltd (in liquidation) v Baker Et Al</i> (1933) O.R. 286.</font>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.        On the other

hand, Counsel for the Defendants relied on the principle that where beneficial ownership

has passed to the buyer prior to the relevant date, then the sale price should be eligible

for set-off against what is payable to the buyer even though the sale price is not payable

until some future date. For convenience, I will refer to this as ‘the Beneficial

Ownership Set-Off Principle’. He relied on <i>In Re Daintrey</i> [1900] 1 QB 546 and <i>In

Re Taylor</i> [1910] 1 KB 562.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69.        In my view, <i>In

Re Daintrey</i> is not authority for the Beneficial Ownership Set-Off Principle. It is

authority for the principle that it is enough for a debt to qualify for a set-off if, at

the relevant date, the debt was a contingent one which in due course might become due and

payable. For convenience, I will refer to this principle as ‘the Contingent Debt

Set-Off Principle’.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p></p></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">70.        <i>In Re

Taylor</i> is also authority for the Contingent Debt Set-Off Principle, although it is as

well an authority for the Beneficial Ownership Set-Off Principle.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71.        The

Contingent Debt Set-Off Principle has been approved and applied in Australia in <i>Hiley v

Peoples Prudential Assurance Co Ltd (In Liq.)</i> [1938] 60 CLR 468 and in <i>Day &amp;

Dent Construction Proprietary Limited (In Liquidation) </i>[1981-1982] 150 CLR 85, both of

which were decisions of the High Court of Australia.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72.        These

decisions were followed in a more recent decision of the High Court of Australia i.e. <i>Gye

v McIntyre</i> [1991] 171 CLR 609. In that case, the High Court of Australia considered

the effect of s 86(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(1) Subject to this section, where

  there have been mutual credits, mutual debts or other mutual dealings between a person who

  has become a bankrupt and a person claiming to prove a debt in the bankruptcy -</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    an account shall be taken of what is

    due from the one party to the other in respect of those mutual dealings;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the sum due from the one party shall

    be set off against any sum due from the other party; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c)    only the balance of the account may

    be claimed in the bankruptcy, or is payable to the trustee in the bankruptcy, as the case

    may be.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73.        At p 623 to

624 of the report, the High Court said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘In the context of s. 86, the word

  "mutual" conveys the notion of reciprocity rather than that of correspondence.

  It does not mean "identical" or "the same". So understood, there are

  three aspects of the section’s requirement of mutuality. The first is that the

  credits, the debts, or the claims arising from other dealings be between the same persons.

  The second is that the benefit or burden of them lie in the same interests. In determining

  whether credits, debts or claims arising from other dealings are between the same persons

  and in the same interests, it is the equitable or beneficial interests of the parties

  which must be considered: see, e.g., <i>Hiley</i> (52). The third requirement of mutuality

  is that the credits, debts, or claims arising from other dealings must be commensurable

  for the purposes of set-off under the section. That means that they must ultimately sound

  in money.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The requirement that the credits, the

  debts or the claims arising from other dealings be commensurable does not mean they must

  be vested, liquidated or enforceable at the decisive date, that is to say, at the time of

  the sequestration order or special resolution accepting the composition. Provided they

  exist as contingent at that date and are of a kind which will ultimately mature into

  pecuniary demands susceptible of set-off, the requirement of the section may be satisfied

  in relation to them. In so far as "dealings" are concerned, Dixon J. pointed out

  in <i>Hiley</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"It is enough that at the

    commencement of the winding up mutual dealings exist which involve rights and obligations

    whether absolute or contingent of such a nature that afterwards in the events that happen

    they mature or develop into pecuniary demands capable of set off. If the end contemplated

    by the transaction is a claim sounding in money so that, in the phrase employed in the

    cases, it is commensurable with the cross-demand, no more is required than that at the

    commencement of the winding up liabilities shall have been contracted by the company and

    the other party respectively from which cross money claims accrue during the course of the

    winding up." ’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74.        This

approach in <i>Gye v McIntyre</i> is similar to that of the House of Lords in <i>Stein v

Blake</i> (see the part of its judgment which I have cited in para 60 above).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75.        Again, if I

were not bound by authority, I would be of the view that under s 41(1) of the pre-1995

Bankruptcy Act, a contingent claim which arises after but is based on an existing contract

as at the relevant date is capable of being set-off against an already existing claim and

it would not be necessary for me to consider the argument of the Defendants based on the

Beneficial Owner Set-Off Principle. In any event, I do not intend to consider that

argument in the light of the other points which are made below.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.        As regards

the argument that after the relevant date, the creditor is not the company but the

liquidator and thus debts owing by the company as at the relevant date cannot be set-off

against debts owing to the liquidator after the relevant date, I would also be of the view

that this is not a valid argument. If it were, existing claims by a company can never be

set-off against contingent claims against the company which mature after the relevant

date. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77.        Likewise,

existing (and continuing) claims against the company can be set-off against contingent

claims by the company.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78.        I now refer

to s 41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act which states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘41(1) Where there have been mutual

  other in respect of such mutual dealings, and the sum <u>due</u> from the one party shall

  be set off against any sum <u>due</u> from the other party, and the balance of the account

  and no more shall be claimed or paid on either side respectively.’</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79.        This is

similar to:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    Section 86(1) of the Australian

  Bankruptcy Act 1966 (considered in <i>Gye v McIntyre</i> and set out in para 72 above),

  and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    Section 323 of the English

  Insolvency Act 1986 (considered in <i>Stein v Blake</i> where the provision is set out in

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80.        The

comparable provision of s 41(1) in the applicable Bankruptcy Act is s 88(1) which states:</font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81.        As can be

41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82.        Neither

Counsel for the liquidator nor for the Defendants made any submission about the

difference. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83.        My

consideration of the following has not yielded any explanation for the difference:</font></p>

  on the Bankruptcy Bill [Bill No 16/94], and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c)    the Parliamentary Debates on this

  Bankruptcy Bill.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84.        I am of the

view that if, as seems to be the case, the judgment in the <i>Good Property</i> case has

decided that under s 41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act, contingent claims are not

capable of being the subject of set-off, then, the applicable s 88(1) has changed the

position and it allows the Defendants’ claims for liquidated damages to be set-off

against the contingent claims of the Vendor which have now matured into claims against the

Defendants. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85.        Aside from

the judgment in the <i>Good Property</i> case, I would be of the view that s 88(1) does

not change the position because even under s 41(1) of the pre-1995 Bankruptcy Act,

contingent claims are capable of being the subject of set-off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86.        My view of

the position under s 88(1) is reinforced when other provisions of the applicable

Bankruptcy Act are considered.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.        For example,

s 88(2)(a) of the applicable Bankruptcy Act states:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    is not a debt provable in

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    … ’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88.        Sections

87(1) and (3) of the applicable Bankruptcy Act state what debts are provable:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘87(1)    Demands in

  the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise

  or breach of trust shall not be provable in bankruptcy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2)    …</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(3)    Subject to this section and section

  90, any debt or liability to which the bankrupt -</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">and any interest on such debt or liability

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89.        Although ss

87(1) and (3) apply to debts owing by the bankrupt and not to the bankrupt, it is

significant for its approach i.e. it includes any contingent debt to which the bankrupt

may become subject before his discharge by reason of any obligation incurred before the

date of the bankruptcy order.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90.        I am of the

view that similarly for s 88(1) which applies to any debt which ‘each party …

may become subject’ to, contingent debts of one party may be set-off against existing

debts owing to that party.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91.        Thus, the

S&amp;P is the obligation incurred by each Defendant before the relevant date and each

Defendant’s liability to pay under cl 3(1)(g) and (h) of the S&amp;P is the debt

which it/he ‘may become subject’ to and now has become subject to.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">DISTINGUISHING FACTS</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92.        In any

event, there are other facts in the present case before me which distinguish it from the <i>Good

Property </i>case.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Contractual set-off</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93.        First, the

right of set-off for late delivery of possession is contractually provided for in cl 11(4)

of the S&amp;P. This is a material difference.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94.        The

liquidator has carried on with the S&amp;Ps. It is said that he used the resources of the

company to achieve the stages under cll 3(1)(g) and (h) but that is besides the point. The

fact is that he has carried on with the S&amp;Ps. Having done so, he cannot, in my view,

claim the benefits under the S&amp;Ps and yet disclaim the burdens under them. He cannot

choose which terms of the S&amp;Ps would continue to apply to him and which would not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95.        The point is

not so much whether the liquidator is the same person as the Vendor but whether he is

choosing to enforce the same contracts or not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96.        For example,

in <i>Re Asphaltic Wood Pavement Company, Lee &amp; Chapman’s Case</i> [1885] Ch D

216, a company had contracted with the Commissioners of Sewers to pave a street. The

Commissioners were to pay 60% of the moneys a month after the engineer’s certificate

of completion, 30% within three months afterwards and 10% at the expiration of two years.

During the two years, the company was to keep the wood surface of the roadway in repair

and if, before the expiry of the two years, the Commissioners should give notice

accordingly, the company was to keep the roadway in repair for fifteen years at a certain

annual rate.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97.        On 9

December 1882, the company presented a petition for a winding up order and on 12 and 16

December 1882 the provisional official liquidator was empowered and ordered to complete

the contract. On 13 January 1883, the winding up order was made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98.        On 29

January 1883, the liquidator sent a claim to the Commissioners and on 8 March 1883, the

engineer certified the work to be complete.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99.        On 19 March

1883, the Commissioners sent to the liquidator a claim of set-off for anticipated breach

of contract to repair for fifteen years. They also claimed to set off damages accrued and

anticipated under other contracts for paying other streets.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100.        One of the

arguments for the liquidator there was that the company after the winding up order was

made was not the same as the company which entered into the contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101.        At p 204 of

the report, Brett M.R. said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘When the company went into

  liquidation, the liquidator evidently thought it for the benefit of the estate that he

  should complete the contract, so as to obtain the payment for it. He got the leave of the

  Court to carry on the contract. It has been argued that the company which carries on the

  contract, is not the same company as that which entered into the contract. Be it so: but

  the contract remained the same; and if the company were to carry on the contract so as to

  earn the money, it is obvious to my mind that they were to carry it on subject also to the

  liability that if they were requested so to do they were to keep the road in repair for

  fifteen years. But they are disabled from performing a part of the contract, and that

  gives a right to the person with whom they have contracted to damages under that

  contract.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">102.        Cotton LJ

also held a similar view. At p 224 he said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘But if I rightly understand the

  argument of the counsel for the liquidator, it was somewhat subtle. He said that it is

  impossible that any such notice should be given, inasmuch as one company entered into the

  contract under which this sum is payable, and that company no longer exists; another and

  different company is now going on. The liquidator can only carry on contracts which have

  been entered into by the company. He has adopted and acted on that contract, and it is

  impossible to say that a different company is acting under the winding-up to what there

  was before. It is true that the liquidator does many things merely as liquidator, but his

  right, if any, to claim this sum of money is in respect of a contract entered into by this

  going company, and it is only to this going company and the liquidator as its

  representative that any sum can be due. In my opinion, therefore, as between the

  Commissioners and the liquidator under the mutual credit clause there is this right of

  set-off.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103.        Although

these statements were made in respect of the statutory right of set-off, I am of the view

that they are equally applicable to the contractual right of set-off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">104.        

Defendants’ Counsel submitted that a reason why the liquidator is bound by the

S&amp;P is because he comes within the definition of ‘Vendor’ in the S&amp;P. In

cl 23 thereof ‘the Vendor’ is defined to include its successors-in-title and

assigns.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105.        Counsel

then referred to <i>Re Cyril Wright</i> [1949] 1 Ch 729 in which a trustee in bankruptcy

was said to come within the definition of ‘successors-in-title’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">106.        However, in

that case, the title vested in the trustee in bankruptcy whereas under the Companies Act

(Cap 50), the title of the company does not vest in the liquidator. That is why the court

in <i>Re Cyril Wright</i> referred (at p 736) to the judgment of Lord Sterndale MR in <i>Re

Farrow’s Bank, Ld</i> [1921] 2 Ch 164 where he said,</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Now, as has been pointed out, the

  position of the trustee in bankruptcy is quite different from that of a liquidator. He

  does not act on behalf of the bankrupt; he does not dispose of the bankrupt’s

  property as such; all the property is vested in him .’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107.        I note that

under ss 9(5) and 9(6)(a) of the Housing Developers Act, the moneys in the Project Account

vests in the liquidator upon compulsory liquidation but this is only for the purpose of

withdrawing monies in the Project Account but not otherwise, see also s 9(6)(b). Sections

9(5), 9(6)(a) and (b) will be set out later in this judgment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108.        Accordingly

I doubt if the liquidator is a successor-in-title of the Vendor but it is, in the

circumstances, not necessary for me to decide this.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Housing Developers legislation</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">109.        Another

special feature of the case before me is that cl 11(4) of the S&amp;P is part of a set of

standard terms prescribed by subsidiary legislation. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">110.        

Furthermore, while Rule 12(2) of the Housing Developers Rules 1985 provided for the

S&amp;P to be in Form E of the Schedule thereto, Rule 12(3) goes on to say:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(3) No amendment, deletion or

  alteration shall be made to the agreement referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) without the

  prior approval in writing of the Controller.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">111.        Accordingly

any argument about the parties trying to circumvent the pari passu principle in a

liquidation cannot carry much weight because the Vendor and the Defendants did not choose

the terms of the S&amp;P on their own free will. Therefore unless the Rules were ultra

vires the Housing Developers Act they had to be given effect to as the Act itself, see <i>Golden

Bay Realty Pte Ltd v Orchard Twelve Investments Pte Ltd</i> [1989] SLR 42.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">112.        In so far

as Counsel for the Defendants has referred me also to Rule 12(4), this is not applicable

as it was introduced in 1997 after the dates of the S&amp;Ps.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113.        It is quite

clear to me that cl 11(4) of the S&amp;P is to protect the interest of purchasers like the

Defendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">114.        This is

reinforced by Rules 15(1) and (2) of the Housing Developers Rules 1985 which state:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘15(1) A housing developer shall not,

  without the prior consent in writing of the Controller, seek from a purchaser of a unit in

  a housing project -</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    any waiver of the purchaser’s

    rights under an agreement for the sale and purchase of the unit; or</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    any release from the performance of

    the housing developer’s duties and obligations under the agreement for the sale and

    purchase of the unit.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Any undertaking given by a purchaser

  of a unit in a housing project to a housing developer which seeks to waive the

  purchaser’s rights or claims against the housing developer for a breach of, or to

  release a housing developer from the performance of, the housing developer’s duties

  and obligations under an agreement for the sale and purchase of the unit shall be

  unenforceable unless the prior consent in writing of the Controller has been

  obtained.’ </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">115.        The

paramount interest of the purchasers is further reinforced by the requirement in the

Housing Developers Act for every developer, within the meaning of the Act, to maintain a

Project Account. Under s 9(3) of the Housing Developers Act, all purchase moneys received

by the developer from the sale of units in the project are to be paid into the Project

Account. Under s 9(4), the developers cannot withdraw any money from the Project Account

except as authorised by rules under the Housing Developers Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116.        In

addition, ss 9(5) and (6) state:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘(5) Subject to subsection (6)(b),

  all moneys in the Project Account shall, notwithstanding any other written law to the

  contrary, be deemed not to form part of the property of the licensed housing developer in

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    the licensed housing developer

    adjudication order made against him; or</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the licensed housing developer,

    being a company, goes into voluntary or compulsory liquidation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(6)    Upon the happening of any of the

  events referred to in subsection (5) -</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    the moneys in the Project Account

    shall vest in the official receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator, as the case may

    be, to be applied for all or any of the purposes for which moneys in the Project Account

    are authorised by rules made under this Act to be withdrawn; and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    any money remaining in the Project

    and fulfilled</u>, shall be held by the official receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or

    liquidator, as the case may be, as money belonging to the licensed housing developer to be

    applied in accordance with the law relating to bankruptcy or the winding up of

    companies.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117.        Sections

9(5) and 9(6) make it clear that the monies from payments (under cl 3 of the S&amp;P)

which are required to be put into the Project Account are not the property of the

developer and vest in the liquidator only to carry out the purposes for which moneys in

the Project Account are authorised, by rules made under the Housing Developers Act, to be

withdrawn.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118.        

Furthermore, under s 9(6)(b), it is only when payments made pursuant to paragraph 6(a)

have been made and all liabilities of the developer under the S&amp;P have been

‘fully discharged and fulfilled’ that the balance remaining in the Project

Account is to be held by the liquidator as money belonging to the developer to be applied

in accordance with the law relating to bankruptcy or the winding up of companies.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119.        One of the

liabilities and obligations of a developer under the S&amp;P is to ensure that vacant

possession is delivered to purchasers by a certain deadline (under cl 11(1)) failing which

the developer is liable to pay liquidated damages (under cl 11(3)).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">120.        

Accordingly, if monies have already been paid under cl 3 of the S&amp;P, they would have

to be paid into the Project Account first. The liquidator would then use the moneys for

any of the authorised purposes and thereafter have to use it to pay to the purchaser

liquidated damages that may arise before making any payment to unsecured creditors (in so

far as their claims do not come under s 9(6)(a)).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121.        In the

present case before me, the Defendants do not have to pay first because of cl 11(4) of the

S&amp;P. However, if they happened to pay first, their claim for liquidated damages would

still rank ahead of unsecured creditors.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122.        Counsel for

the liquidator cited <i>Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v C &amp; K (Construction) Ltd </i>[1976] AC 167 and submitted that the liquidator is making calls for payment under cll 3(1)(g) and

(h) of the S&amp;P for the benefit of a pool of unsecured creditors. This is not a valid

argument. The liquidator, in making the calls, does so to complete the project and then to

comply with obligations under the S&amp;P like paying the liquidated damages to the

purchasers. The unsecured creditors rank last.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123.        Even if the

liquidator does not require the monies called for to complete the project or to comply

with other obligations under the S&amp;P, this does not mean that the interest of the

unsecured creditors negates the right of purchasers to the set-off claimed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124.        As regards

an argument by Counsel for the liquidator that if a set-off is allowed, it might be

preferring the purchasers against other creditors, which should not be the case, this

again is not a valid argument. The entire scheme under the Housing Developers Act is that

the purchasers are to be preferred to other creditors generally.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125.        

Furthermore, the mutual credit and set-off provision in the bankruptcy legislation itself

acknowledges that some creditors may be in a better position than others provided they can

satisfy the requirements of mutuality.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">126.        As regards

another argument by Counsel for the liquidator that to refuse the set-off would not put

purchasers in a worse position because they would be treated like other unsecured

creditors, this again is not a valid argument. Purchasers are not supposed to be treated

like other unsecured creditors. To do so would put them in a worse position than that

envisaged under the Housing Developers legislation and the bankruptcy legislation.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Further arguments</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">127.        The

liquidator’s Counsel also raised the following arguments in the course of further

arguments.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">128.        He referred

to s 94 of the applicable Bankruptcy Act read with Rule 185 of the Bankruptcy Rules.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">129.        Section 94

deals with interest on debts which are proved and Rule 185 of the Bankruptcy Rules

prescribes the rate of interest to be 8% per annum.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">130.        He argued

that the liquidated damages under cl 11(3) were in the nature of interest and suggested

that therefore they should be reduced to 8% per annum.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">131.        The short

answer to this argument is that these provisions relate to debts which are proved. The

Defendants are not seeking to prove the liquidated damages in the liquidation of the

Vendor. They are setting-off the liquidated damages against the amounts payable by them

under cl 3(1)(g) and (h) of the S&amp;P. After doing so there is a balance due from each

of the Defendants which each has paid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">132.        The

liquidated damages is 10% of the total sum so far paid under cl 3 of the S&amp;P whereas

the interest under s 94 and Rule 185 is 8% on the sum proved after the set-off has been

effected. The two are different.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">133.        Next, the

liquidator’s Counsel relied on <i>British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v

Compagnie Nationale Air France</i> [1975] 2 All ER 390 (‘the <i>British Eagle </i>case’)

to support his argument that parties cannot contract out of a provision in the Companies

Act relating to the principle of distributing a company’s property pari passu.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">134.        I have

already stated that the terms in each S&amp;P are dictated by subsidiary legislation made

pursuant to a statute. The general principle of a pari passu distribution in a liquidation

must be subject to these specific terms and not the other way around.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">135.        Besides,

the general principle of pari passu distribution is also subject to the provision on

mutual credit and set-off in bankruptcy legislation. I note that in the <i>British Eagle</i>

case, the mutual credits and debits as between each of various airlines and British Eagle

had been set-off first (see p 407 of the report), presumably under a mutual credit and

set-off statutory provision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">136.        The

question there was whether those airlines which had a net debit balance had to pay the

liquidator and those with a net credit balance had to prove in the liquidation or a

clearing house arrangement was binding on the liquidator. In that context the House of

Lords decided that the clearing house arrangement was not binding on the liquidator.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">137.        The <i>British

Eagle</i> case has sometimes been used as an authority to champion the general principle

of pari passu distribution over set-off generally.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">138.        It must be

borne in mind that there are different bases for set-off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">139.        As far as

statutory set-off under any particular legislation is concerned, that set-off should

prevail over the principle of pari passu distribution under the Companies Act (Cap 50).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">140.        As to

whether the principle of pari passu distribution prevails over contractual set-off, this

would depend on the particular facts of each case.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">141.        I have

decided on various grounds that the Defendants are entitled to the set-off they claim.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">142.        The grounds

are (a) statutory set-off under s 88(1) of the applicable Bankruptcy Act, (b) contractual

set-off because the S&amp;Ps have been adopted by the liquidator, and (c) statutory

set-off because the S&amp;Ps are in any event binding on the liquidator in view of the

Housing Developers legislation.</font></p>
