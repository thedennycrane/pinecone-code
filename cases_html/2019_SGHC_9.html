The Defendants deny any liability to pay the Plaintiff.  In addition, they have brought a counter-claim against the Plaintiff and three other parties for breach of duty in the management of the accounts and tax affairs of the four Defendants, as well as alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by one of these other parties (one Kam You Kin or “Kam”).  The present two appeals arise from the Defendants’ application in SUM 2085/2018 to strike out the entire Statement of Claim.  The Defendants were unsuccessful in obtaining a striking-out before the Assistant Registrar (“AR”), who ordered instead that the Plaintiff make a number of amendments, as specified by the AR, to its Statement of Claim.  The Defendants appealed against the AR’s decision. They succeeded partially in the appeal, which I heard.  I ordered certain portions of the amended Statement of Claim to be struck out, but declined to order that the entire claim be struck out.  Both the Plaintiff and the Defendants have appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 There is an error in the Plaintiff’s Notice of Appeal in CA 179/2018 in that it refers to my decision “on 30 August 2018”.  There was no hearing before me on 30 August 2018.  The Defendants’ appeal against the AR’s decision (RA 160/2018) was heard before me on 25 July 2018; and at the end of that hearing, I ordered that the Plaintiff be given leave to file and serve an amended Statement of Claim within 7 days and that parties appear before me again to submit on whether the Statement of Claim was saved by the amendments made.  At the further hearing on 10 August 2018, the Defendants contended that the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) should still be struck out in its entirety.  After hearing submissions, I declined to strike out the entire claim but ordered instead that the following portions of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) be struck out:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Paragraph 10, insofar as this paragraph purported to plead an oral agreement between the Plaintiff on the one hand and the 2nd to 4th Defendants on the other;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) (Consequential to the striking-out of paragraph 10) The words “Further and/or alternatively” at the start of paragraph 12;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Paragraph 19, which purported to plead waiver and/or estoppel;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Paragraph 19A, which purported to plead an alternative claim of restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) (Consequential to the striking-out of paragraph 19A) The references in the prayers numbered (1) to (4) on the last two pages of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) to alternative claims for “such sums as may be assessed by this Honourable Court on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Defendants requested a further hearing, as they claimed the Plaintiff had included “prohibited amendments” in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 4) filed on 17 August 2018.  Following some clarifications by the Plaintiff’s then counsel at the hearing on 10 September 2018, the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 5) was filed on 11 September 2018.  The Defence &amp; Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) was filed on 25 September 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Another hearing took place on 1 October 2018 pursuant to parties’ request.  At this further hearing, the Defendants’ counsel informed that they had only recently noticed the reference to “estoppel” in what was previously paragraph 18A of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) (renumbered as paragraph 19 in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 5)).  The Defendants’ counsel submitted that the Plaintiff’s assertion of an estoppel, having been previously struck out, the reference to “estoppel” in paragraph 19 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 5) could not stand.  I ordered that paragraph 19 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 5) be struck out.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the hearing on 1 October 2018 the Plaintiff’s then counsel had requested time to file the re-amended Statement of Claim and to take instructions on an application to include fresh amendments alleging a “different kind of estoppel”.  However, the Plaintiff proceeded to file an appeal on the same day (CA 179/2018) against the striking-out of certain portions of its Statement of Claim and against the costs awarded against it in RA 160/2018.  The Defendants filed a cross-appeal (CA 182/2018) on the same day.  I understand the Defendants to be appealing against my refusal to strike out the entire claim or to order that it be struck out at least against the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 For ease of reference, the original Statement of Claim is appended as Annex A.  The Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) – which incorporated the amendments directed by the AR during the hearing of the Defendants’ striking-out application – is appended as Annex B.  The Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) and the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 5) are appended as Annex C and Annex D respectively.  The original Defence and Counterclaim is appended as Annex E and the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) as Annex F.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Before I set out the reasons for my decision, I will summarise whom the parties are in these proceedings as well as the undisputed facts and the competing claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Plaintiff (also the 2nd Defendant in Counterclaim), the 3rd Defendant in the Counterclaim (Corporatebuilders Consultancy Pte Ltd or “Corporatebuilders”) and the 4th Defendant in the Counterclaim (BMI Accounting Services Pte Ltd or “BMI Accounting”) are private limited                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 companies incorporated in Singapore.

They will be collectively referred to in these grounds of decision as “the Three Companies”, although I will also refer to the Three Companies and Dr Heng collectively as “the four Defendants” from time to time.  Dr Heng is the sole director of the Three Companies.  He is also the sole shareholder of TMaACPL and holds 99% of the shares in KHMWCPL and KMHCSPL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The undisputed facts and the competing claims </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Dr Heng and Kam got to know each other in 2002.  The Three Companies’ accounts and tax affairs were managed by Corporatebuilders from their respective date of incorporation until Income Tax Year of Assessment (“YA”) 2009.  For YA 2010 and YA 2011, their accounts were managed by BMI Accounting; and their tax affairs by the Plaintiff, BMI Tax.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 7 April 2010, the Three Companies each signed a “Tax Retainer Service Agreement” (“TRSA”) confirming their engagement of the Plaintiff to assist with the companies’ tax affairs.

Paragraph 19 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) did not state what the Plaintiff meant by the assertion that the Defendants had “through the 1st Defendant and/or Ms Vivian Heng, acknowledged the 2016 Invoices and accepted, either expressly or implicitly, the Defendants’ liability to make payment on the 2016 Invoices”.  However, in oral submissions on 10 August 2018, the Plaintiff’s counsel stated that this referred to the text messages between the parties, in which Vivian Heng had asked Kam for “more time” and during which neither Dr Heng nor Vivian had objected to the 2016 Invoices being issued by Matrico.

In <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [57], the CA explained that the doctrine of equitable or promissory estoppel “requires an unequivocal representation by one party that he will not insist upon his legal rights against the other party, and such reliance by the representee as will render it inequitable for the representor to go back upon his representation… (A) party to an equitable estoppel is representing that he will in future forbear to enforce his legal rights… <span class="font-italic">(T)his doctrine is premised on inequity, not choice, hence the requirement of reliance</span>”.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I emphasize in particular the italicised words – because this is where the Plaintiff’s case on “promissory estoppel” falls apart.  According to its counsel, its case is that the Defendants had – by paying the 2015 Invoices and by failing to object to Matrico’s issuance of the 2016 Invoices – represented that they would not enforce the contractual requirement for invoices to be issued by the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff had relied on this representation by not complying with such requirement in issuing the 2017 Invoices.

The Defendants have not stated in their Notice of Appeal the orders they are appealing, but given the nature of the relief they were seeking in RA 160/2018, I understand them to be appealing against my refusal to strike out the entire Statement of Claim, or alternatively to order that the Statement of Claim be struck out in entirety against the 1st Defendant Dr Heng.  I will address below the main arguments raised by the Defendants in RA 160/2018.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the Defendants’ argument that there has been “fatal” procedural non-compliance with the Fees Clause of the TRSAs </span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Defendants have argued that the Fees Clause of the TRSAs sets out the following procedural requirements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Invoices must be issued only by the Plaintiff BMI Tax;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Invoices must be issued “progressively” or sequentially, “as work progresses”.  In this connection, I understand the Defendants to mean, for example, that if an invoice has already been issued for work done on a specific date (say Date <span class="font-italic">X</span>), the Plaintiff cannot then issue a later invoice claiming for work done prior to Date <span class="font-italic">X</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Fees charged in the invoices must be based on “the degree of responsibility and skill involved and time spent”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fees are “payable upon presentation” and not earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is the Defendants’ case that the Plaintiff’s right to bring an action for its fees only arises when these lleged procedural requirements have been complied with; and that in this case, the Plaintiff has no right to bring an action because it has failed to comply with these procedural requirements.

</div>
</div> in support of this argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">Ice Architects</span>, the appellant (“ICE”) was an architectural practice, while the respondent (“EPIC”) was a registered provider of social housing.  Pursuant to a letter dated 10 July 2007 sent by EPIC’s project manager, ICE was appointed as the architects for a housing project being developed by EPIC.  This letter included the following passage under the heading “Basis of Payment”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You will invoice EPIC on a monthly basis for work completed to date.  The basis of payment proposed in the appendix to the document described above is acceptable.  EPIC will endeavour to make payment within 30 days of receipt (unless otherwise stated).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 A dispute arose over an invoice issued by ICE on 23 April 2009 for the sum of £42,375 (plus VAT) for services provided under the terms of the contract.  Following an adjudication process, ICE was awarded £24,033.85.  ICE then commenced civil proceedings on 21 May 2015 to recover the balance of the invoice sum.  The central argument advanced by EPIC at the first-instance hearing was that ICE’s cause of action arose when the relevant design work (for which payment was claimed in the invoice) was completed – which was sometime in 2008; and that ICE’s claim was accordingly time-barred under section 5 of the Limitation Act 1980 of the United Kingdom (“UK”), the civil proceedings having been commenced more than 6 years after the accrual of the cause of action.  ICE, for its part, argued that the cause of action did not accrue until 30 days after receipt of the invoice issued on 23 April 2009.  The first-instance judge found in EPIC’s favour; and on appeal, his decision was upheld by Lambert J.  In gist, Lambert J upheld the following propositions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the absence of agreement to the contrary, the starting point is that a provider of services is entitled to be paid once the work has been done and so its cause of action for payment arises at that time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clear words are needed if the timing of the accrual of the cause of action in an action for work or services is to be displaced.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the present case, based on an objective plain reading of the relevant paragraph of the 10 July 2007 letter, “(n)othing in the language of the relevant paragraph, viewed in isolation or in the context of the letter as a whole… suggests that the parties were intending that ICE’s entitlement to payment did not arise when the work was done” (see at [22] – [23]).  A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the relevant words to be an agreement concerning only the process of billing and payment, namely the monthly provision of an invoice with payment within 30 days thereafter.  Further, in the context of the 10 July 2007 letter and having regard to the circumstances in this case, it was “common sense” that both parties would have wished to reach some agreement concerning the billing and payment arrangement: on an objective construction of the parties’ intention, the payment terms in the letter reflected just such an arrangement.  Given the nature of the design work and the budgetary constraints faced by EPIC, monthly invoicing would have been important, certainly for EPIC, as a means of keeping a running check on the financial outlay on design services. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) More generally, whether the cause of action accrues on completion of the work or at some other time is a matter of construction of the relevant contractual term or other statutory provision.  Thus, two of the cases cited to the first-instance judge – <span class="font-italic">Henry Boot Construction Ltd v Alstom Combined Cycles Ltd</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 814 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Boot</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Legal Services Commission v Henthorn</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 1415 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Henthorn</span>”) – were both examples of the court undertaking such an exercise in objective construction; and the outcome of the construction exercise in each case was bolstered by common sense and logic.  In neither case could the quantum of the debt have been identified at the completion of the work in question.  In <span class="font-italic">Boot</span>, the entitlement was not to the true value of the work completed but the value attributed to that work by the engineer.  In <span class="font-italic">Henthorn</span>, which concerned fees paid by the Legal Services Commission “on account” to counsel in a civil legal aid case, the extent of the Commission’s recoupment of the sums paid on account could only be known following taxation of the costs.  No such difficulty arose in respect of the ICE invoices which required no further analysis or assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In <span class="font-italic">Fairview</span>, it can be seen that the CA was undertaking the same “objective construction exercise” spoken of by Lambert J.  In that case, the appellant (“Fairview”) was the developer of a plot of land.  Fairview had engaged Ong &amp; Ong Architects (“OOA”) to be the architect for the development of this plot of land in the 1970s, OOA being subsequently succeeded by Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd (“OOPL”).  In 2009, Fairview terminated OOPL’s services.  Proceedings ensued in which the trial judge dismissed OOPL’s claim for wrongful termination of its services but allowed its claim for fees for abortive works on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis.  On appeal, Fairview argued <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that even if OOPL were entitled to claim for fees for the abortive works, such a claim had been time-barred under the Limitation Act.  The CA therefore considered the question of when OOPL’s right to payment and corresponding cause of action to sue upon such right arose.  It held at [87] – [88] that in this case, the terms in the SIA Conditions 1985 pertaining to the mode and time of payment applied; and that reading the opening paragraph of condition 6.1 and note (a) of the said terms –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…(I)t was evident that while an architect became entitled to progress payments upon the completion of the various stages, such progress payment only became ‘due and payable’ upon the issuance of the relevant invoice(s).  Accordingly, while an architect’s entitlement to payment accrues upon completion of various stages, no right and corresponding cause of action to sue upon such a right arises unless and until the relevant invoice(s) had been issued.  To put it another way, the entitlement to fees crystallises into a right upon which a cause of action accrues only when the invoice is issued.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Our interpretation in the preceding paragraph accords first, with the permissive and open manner in which it was stated in the opening paragraph of condition 6.1 that the architect “shall be entitled” to progress payments on completion of each stage, as opposed to words with a more mandatory effect such as “the client <span class="font-italic">shall</span> pay to the architect”.  Our interpretation also accords with the absence of any condition setting out a timeline within which the architect must render its invoice.  Any concern that such an interpretation would result in developers being inundated by invoices relating to work completed an inordinately long time ago (possibly even beyond the six year limitation period for contractual claims) was, in our view, valid but in the final analysis, overstated.  An architect would not (for obvious commercial reasons) want to be put out of pocket for too long.  And so long as the working relationship between the parties is ongoing, the flexibility to decide when to bill… would be commercially beneficial to both the architect and its client, particularly where the construction project in question is a long and drawn-out one.  The architect would be assured of its due entitlement to payment while, on the other hand, the client would have room to negotiate with the architect on when the invoice is to be issued and when the actual payment is to be made based on the parties’ respective commercial considerations.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Having regard to the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Ice Architects</span> and <span class="font-italic">Fairview</span>, what the present Defendants had to show was that there were “clear words” in the Fees Clause of the TRSAs which provided for specific procedural requirements (<span class="font-italic">e.g.</span> issuance of invoices only in the Plaintiff’s name and strictly in sequence according to the date when work was done) to be complied with <span class="font-italic">before the Plaintiff’s right to bring an action for payment of its fees could arise</span>.  The Fees Clause is reproduced in [11] above.  On a plain reading of this clause, I was not persuaded that it had this effect.  If anything, a plain reading of the Fees Clause suggested that it was intended simply to provide for a mechanism for billing and payment.  To use the words of Lambert J in <span class="font-italic">Ice Architects</span>, nothing in the language of this clause – viewed in isolation or in the context of the TRSA as a whole – suggested that parties were intending that the Plaintiff’s right to bring an action for its fees should not arise when the work was done and should, instead, only arise upon invoices being issued in its name, and  issued moreover in strict chronology according to the sequence of work done.  Nor was it clear to me why “common sense and logic” required that the Fees Clause be interpreted in this manner.  This was not, for example, a case like <span class="font-italic">Boot</span> or <span class="font-italic">Henthorn</span> where the quantum of the debt was incapable of being ascertained upon the completion of the work in question.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 To sum up: having reviewed the provisions of the Fees Clause, I did not accept that the clause provided for the Plaintiff’s right to bring an action for its fees to arise only when specific procedural requirements (such as the sequential issuance of invoices in the Plaintiff’s own name) had been complied with.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Defendants also alleged in the course of the appeal

</div> Steven Chong J (as he then was) stated that there was “a wider dimension to the doctrine [of approbation and reprobation] which discourages the adoption of ‘inconsistent attitudes’ and warns that stark shifts in positions from previous proceedings would be viewed ‘with some circumspection and scepticism”.  He added that even if the doctrine were strictly not applicable in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>, he found it “simply fallacious” for the plaintiff to rely on the same single set of minutes of meetings to advance two different contracts against two different parties (see at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, the Defendants have drawn up in Annex A to their written submissions of 23 July 2018 a schedule of what they say represents the Plaintiff’s approbation and reprobation of the TRSAs.  They have also cited in their written submissions numerous examples of the Plaintiff’s alleged approbation and reprobation of the TRSAs.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I do not think it can be the case that whenever a plaintiff is said to have shifted its position in the course of proceedings, its claim must immediately and invariably be struck out at the interlocutory stage.  I do not understand Steven Chong J to be espousing such a position in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>, nor did I understand the Defendants’ counsel to be advocating so sweeping an approach in the present case.  It must surely be a question of degree as to how egregious the shifts in position are, and what reasons (if any) there may have been for the shifts in position.  Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span> for example, the conduct which was held by Chong J to offend the spirit of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation was the plaintiff’s adoption of two starkly different positions vis-à-vis a meeting between parties on 15 April 2009, firstly in its pleaded case in arbitration proceedings against the second defendant, and secondly in its pleaded case in a separate and later set of civil proceedings against both defendants.  As Chong J put it at [59] of <span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If we assume both the pleaded case in the arbitration and the plaintiff’s present case on the Procurement Agreement to be true, the implications would simply be absurd.  It would mean that, at the same meeting on 15 April 2009, the plaintiff did two things: first, it modified its earlier contract with the second defendant to bring into existence the Conquest Agreement; and second, it entered into a new contract with the first defendant (i.e. the Procurement Agreement).  <span class="font-italic">Both</span> these contracts would be for the use of the <span class="font-italic">same</span> vessels (i.e. the <span class="font-italic">Swiber Concorde</span> or <span class="font-italic">Swiber Conquest</span>), which were to be made available by 20-22 May 2009, for the <span class="font-italic">same project</span> (i.e. the VSP project).  If this was truly what happened, the plaintiff would be under separate contractual obligations towards both the first defendant and the second defendant to pay the rate of charter hire for the <span class="font-italic">Swiber Concorde</span> or the <span class="font-italic">Swiber Conquest</span> when either vessel is delivered to the plaintiff.  There is no sensible reason why the plaintiff would have contracted with <span class="font-italic">two separate parties</span> for the charter of the <span class="font-italic">same vessel</span> for the same project and therefore expose itself to double liability for the charter hire.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the present case, the “flip-flopping” on the Plaintiff’s part which was decried by the Defendants related to the issue of whether the Plaintiff’s contractual relationship with each Defendant vis-à-vis the Work was based on the TRSAs, or whether such contractual relationship arose from some other agreement outside the TRSAs.  It can be seen from Annex A to these written grounds that the Plaintiff’s position on this issue was not stated clearly in the original Statement of Claim.  In Kam’s 3rd affidavit of 21 May 2018 which was filed in response to the Defendants’ striking-out application in SUM 2085/2018, Kam had stated that “(t)he Work was outside of and separate to the terms of the [TRSAs]”.

My reasons were as follows.  It was clear to me, from a review of the notes of the hearing before the AR and from the various hearings before me, that much of the “flip-flopping” that had apparently occurred on the Plaintiff’s part vis-à-vis the TRSAs was the result of what I can only describe as bizarre conduct on the part of its counsel.  For one, as the Defendants’ counsel pointed out, it appeared from the remarks made by the Plaintiff’s counsel to the AR that he had only perused the terms of the TRSA for the first time during the lunch break on the day of the hearing on 4 June 2018.  Indeed, just before the adjournment for the lunch break, he had informed the AR that “the Work falls outside the scope of the TRSA”

The description of these eight items approximates to the description of the work billed for in the 2015 Invoices.  It will be recalled that the 2015 Invoices had stated the work billed for as being a “professional fee for attendance to Board of Review” on behalf of the four Defendants (in respect of Invoice No. M00415), and a “professional fee for attendance to Judicial Review of Appeal for Notice of Assessment” on behalf of the four Defendants (in respect of Invoice No. M00458).

</div>  The removal of these eight items from the Schedule would seem, therefore, to address one of the Defendants’ complaints – namely, that at least part of the work the Plaintiff was claiming payment for in this suit had already been billed in the 2015 Invoices and paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83   The Defendants’ other major complaint about the Schedule was that the figures stated therein for the time spent by Kam and his colleague, and their hourly charge-out rates, could not be reconciled with the figures stated in the 2017 Invoices.  In gist, the Schedule sets out the number of hours spent by Kam and his colleague on various major items of work done in the period between 25 April 2012 and 23 February 2015, as well as their hourly charge-out rates, before applying a discount to Kam’s hourly rate so as to arrive at the concluding figures for the total fees claimed against each Defendant: $30,000 in respect of Dr Heng; $105,000 in respect of KMHWCPL; $90,000 in respect of KMHCSPL; and $60,000 in respect of TMaACPL.  It should be noted that in setting out in the Schedule the number of hours spent by Kam and his colleague on major items of work, the Plaintiff has not given a breakdown of <span class="font-italic">the number of hours spent per each individual Defendant</span>.  It should also be noted that in respect of each Defendant, work was – according to the Plaintiff – done in respect of a different number of Years of Assessment (“YAs”): two YAs for Dr Heng (YA 2003 and YA 2004); seven YAs for KMHWCPL (YA 2005 to YA 2011); six YAs for KMHCSPL (YA 2003 to YA 2008); and four YAs for TMaACPL (YAs 2008 to 2011).  In the Schedule, the Plaintiff does not include a breakdown of <span class="font-italic">the number of hours spent in respect of each YA</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the 2017 Invoices, the same figures for total fees were stated in respect of each Defendant

</div> ($30,000 for Dr Heng; $105,000 for KMHWCPL; $90,000 for KMHCSPL; and $60,000 for TMaACPL): what the Plaintiff then did was to divide the total fee figure for each Defendant by the number of YAs worked on for that Defendant, which resulted in what the Defendants’ counsel has termed a “flat fee” of $15,000 per each YA per each Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is true that the manner in which the number of hours worked and the hourly charge-out rates has been set out in the Schedule does not explain the apparent apportionment of a flat rate of $15,000 per each YA per each Defendant.  The question, though, is whether the apparent inconsistencies in the Plaintiff’s figures give rise – as the Defendants claim – to a clear inference of fraud warranting the striking-out of the claim in entirety.  On balance, I did not think that there was such clear evidence of fraud in this case, or that this was a plain and obvious case for striking-out.  As I alluded to earlier, the Defendants in this case appear to concede that Kam and the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">did</span> provide some advice and that they <span class="font-italic">did</span> carry out some work on behalf of all four Defendants in relation to the issue of a potential challenge to IRAS’ decision.  Nor – on the evidence adduced – is it clear that all of the work done was subsumed under the 2015 Invoices which were paid via KMHWCPL’s cheques.  Both the Defence and Counterclaim and the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) refer, for example, to advice given by Kam and letters drafted by Kam and/or the Plaintiff BMI Tax in April 2012, May 2013, and August 2013 – that is, in the period of time preceding the correspondence with the Income Tax Board of Review and the discussions regarding a potential judicial review application.  It may be that the <span class="font-italic">total</span> fees claimed by the Plaintiff cannot at the end of the day be justified, whether on the basis of the amount of time spent, or on the amount of responsibility and skill involved – but that should be a matter left to be determined through the full process of trial.  In this connection, I would add that I did not find the Defendants’ reliance on several remarks made by Kam

Thus, for example, Kam’s remark at his meeting with Dr Heng and the latter’s son on 3 December 2016 – “<span class="font-italic">I think I deserve something</span>” – appeared to me to be at best (or I should say, at worst) a display of truculence by one of the parties to a broken business relationship: I certainly did not see it as evidence that Kam was “himself unsure of [the Plaintiff’s] right to the sums claimed in the 22 September 2017 Matrico invoices”.

Nevertheless, even on 30 May 2016 and in the several months thereafter, Kam’s text messages to Dr Heng (reproduced above) did not disclose any signs of rage or distress despite his continuing to receive no reply from the latter.

</div> it appeared to me the evidence did indicate that he had genuinely believed in May 2016 that HBS would only be taking over the “accounting function” in relation to the clinics (as per HBS’ email), and had only been informed by Vivian on <span class="font-italic">30 August 2016</span> that HBS would “also take over <span class="font-italic">tax</span> and corp sec work from next year”.  This would appear to militate against the Defendants’ suggestion that by 30 May 2016, Kam had started stewing about the possibility of the Defendants “uncovering” his “fraudulent” <span class="font-italic">tax</span> advice and had issued the 2016 Invoices on 7 June 2016 in a malicious attempt to “make it as difficult as possible for [them] to replace him”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 By the second half of 2017, the tone of Kam’s text messages to Vivian and Dr Heng had become noticeably more strident.  On the other hand, considering that Dr Heng had apparently failed to answer most of Kam’s text messages and also refrained from responding to  queries about the payment of the 2016 Invoices, it was perhaps unsurprising – if not at all commendable –  that Kam’s stated concern about the need to “sort out the tax case billing” and “move forward” had boiled over into ire which manifested itself at times in pugnacious behaviour (such as the dispatch of debt collection agents to the Defendants’ clinic premises).  This did not necessarily warrant the inference, however, that the 2017 Invoices and the present suit represented a bogus claim launched solely to pressure the Defendants into paying the Plaintiff monies it was not entitled to.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In particular, vis-à-vis Dr Heng, I did not find the evidence adequate to support an inference that he was named as a defendant solely as a <span class="font-italic">mala fide</span> tactic to force capitulation by all the Defendants.  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, I would reiterate my observation that the Defendants did not appear to deny that the Plaintiff had given advice and done work in relation to the potential challenge to IRAS; and that not all of this work was covered in the 2015 Invoices (see [85] above).  I also noted that whilst the Defendants argued before me that it was unprecedented and highly irregular for an invoice to be addressed to Dr Heng <span class="font-italic">personally</span> in June 2016,

</div> there was no evidence of any queries or protests by Dr Heng – and this despite a number of chasers from Kam regarding payment of the 2016 Invoices.  It may well be that Dr Heng has a reasonable explanation for these aspects of his behaviour.  My point is, the determination of the credibility of Kam’s and Dr Heng’s opposing narratives should lie with the trial judge: on the material before me, there was simply insufficient evidence at this interlocutory stage to find the Plaintiff’s claim <span class="font-italic">mala fide</span> and/or an abuse of process.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff’s pleading of “alternative statements of facts” should not be permitted</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As a final point, I address the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiff should not be permitted to plead “alternative statements of facts”.

The second was that the plaintiff had failed to keep to the left of the lane and had instead been riding near the middle of the lane, thereby obstructing the defendant’s path and riding in a manner which contravened rule 8 of the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules (Cap 276, R 3, 1990 Rev Ed).

</div> the trial judge rejected the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff’s alternative case of a claim in restitution was inconsistent with his pleaded claim in contract.  Referring to <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span>, the trial judge stated at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is settled law that parties may plead inconsistent causes of action in the alternative as long as the inconsistency does not, on the facts, offend common sense… I see no inconsistency of this nature here.  Mr Higgins’ [the plaintiff’s] case is that in the event that the court finds that there is no contract, he claims a sum in restitution.  There is no fatal inconsistency here…  </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, the Plaintiff’s case is that in the event the court does not find that the remuneration terms it has pleaded formed an express term of the alleged oral agreement with Dr Heng, it claims in the alternative an implied term to the same effect.  I did not find these pleadings to be fatally inconsistent and/or to offend common sense.  This was not a case of a party – like the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Pollmann</span> – deliberately putting forward two inconsistent versions of the material facts when the truth or otherwise of the alternative sets of facts was well within his own knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Defendants have further argued that the particulars pleaded by the Plaintiff in [11] of the Statement of Claim fail to “support the implication of a term in that [the Plaintiff] has not pleaded: (a) how there is a gap in the alleged contracts between [the Plaintiff] and the Defendants; (b) how the term is necessary for business efficacy; and (c) facts which establish how the “officious bystander” test is fulfilled”: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte and anor</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”)

</div> it is clear that whilst a party has to particularise in its pleadings the material facts it proposes to rely on in arguing for the implication of a contractual term, much of the detailed explanation as to how the proposed implied term addresses a gap in the existing contract, how it is “necessary for business efficacy”, and how the “officious bystander” test is satisfied is a matter of submission.  For present purposes, I did not find that the particulars pleaded were so inadequate and/or inapt as to provide no basis for the pleading of the implied term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The various iterations of the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in this case have not been well-drafted; and regrettably, as I have indicated, a major cause appears to me to have been the manner in which the case was conducted by the Plaintiff’s counsel.  I have struck out what appeared to me to be those aspects of the claim which were plainly and obviously unsustainable, but for the reasons I have explained, I did not agree with the Defendants that this was a case where the entire claim must be struck out.  Nor did I agree that the amendments which have been allowed would be “unfair” and “prejudicial” to the Defendants: <span class="font-italic">EA Apartments Pte Ltd v Tan Bek and others</span> [2017] 3 SLR 559 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">EA Apartments</span>”).
