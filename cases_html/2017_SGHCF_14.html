</div>
</div> Acumen’s desktop value of the Medical Practice based on their assessment ranged from an “indicative value” of S$12,000 to a “business value” of S$102,000. The indicative value was premised on the adjusted book value of the Medical Practice as at 31 December 2015, which is an accounting value calculated by subtracting the Medical Practice’s total liabilities from its total assets. Acumen opined that “[c]onsidering the transactions of the [Medical Practice] are mainly cash transactions with little or no off balance sheet items, book value appears to be approximate to the fair value of the business”. As for the business value, this was derived based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the Medical Practice’s income and earning potential. Acumen opined that this value provided a “<span class="font-italic">highly accurate estimate of business value</span> based on the business earning potential” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Notwithstanding the above, the Husband submitted that the Medical Practice should be valued at S$15,346, which was the figure for the net tangible assets of the clinic reflected on its balance sheet dated 31 December 2014.

</div>
</div> In essence, the Husband argued that a book value based approach was more useful, echoing Acumen’s observation that such an approach was appropriate for a “cash business” and thus proposed to use the higher figure of S$15,346. In response, the Wife submitted that an income based approach was more appropriate. The Husband had been operating the clinic since 1989 and was well established in the neighbourhood, and the clinic’s profit over the last four years was about S$190,000 – a figure that was far higher than the book value based figures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I agreed with the Wife that an income based approach was the better method of valuation in the circumstances. Even if the Husband chose to discontinue the Medical Practice, he would likely sell the business which has significant goodwill associated with it given its location in a HDB precinct and its existing clientele. Further, as noted by Acumen, such family clinics belonged to a “recession proof industry as the patients will consult doctor[s] regardless of the economic outlook. Walk in patients usually opt to visit [a] particular clinic for one of two reasons: its proximity to the patients’ workplace or home to the clinic and the familiarity of the patients with the doctor practicing in the clinic.”

</div> While the income based method utilised a projection of cash flows for four years going forward, this anticipated cash flow would be similar to that used by any medical practitioner seeking to buy a practice within a HDB precinct. However, even though Acumen set the clinic’s business value at S$102,000 under its income based analysis, I adopted a more conservative figure of S$80,000 because any contemplated sale of the Medical Practice would be dependent upon the vagaries of the market and buyer-seller uncertainties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The inclusion and valuation of most of the other matrimonial assets were agreed between the parties, save in relation to the following assets to which I turn.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In respect of the Husband’s shares in DBS Bank, there was initially a dispute as the Wife’s submission put the figure as S$74,450, whereas the Husband’s submissions had used S$61,354.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this was appropriate in the context of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The legal context should first be set out before we turn to the case on the facts. The Court of Appeal has reiterated, after I gave my decision, that generally, once an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset, it ought to be valued as at the date of the ancillaries hearing, unless a departure is warranted by the facts (“the Valuation Rule”) (see <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal</span> [2017] SGCA 34 (“<span class="font-italic">TND v TNC</span>”) at [19], commenting on <span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter</span> [2016] 4 SLR 145 (“<span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS</span>”) at [50]). This Valuation Rule comes logically subsequent to a preceding inquiry: whether any particular asset forms part of the matrimonial pool in the first place. For this preceding inquiry, which involves determining the appropriate operative date for delineating the pool of matrimonial assets, the law set out by the Court of Appeal is that “unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it, the starting point or default position should be the date that interim judgment is granted” (“the Delineation Rule”) (see <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX and another appeal </span>[2016] 2 SLR 686 at [31]). Two separate default operative dates are therefore relevant for dividing matrimonial assets: for delineation issues, the date of the interim judgment generally prevails; for valuation matters, the default position leans in favour of the date of the ancillaries hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In this case, I was of the view that a departure from the default position under the Valuation Rule was warranted in relation to the bank accounts: these bank accounts were delineated and valued as at the IJ Date instead. This was because the parties had lived separate and independent lives for more than 6 years since January 2011 when the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home. It was thus a reasonable expectation on their part that they would be free to spend from their bank accounts as they saw necessary from the date at which their separation formalised (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the IJ Date), without having to account <span class="font-italic">ex post </span>for or rebut contentions of wrongful dissipation. Therefore, if either spouse, for instance, invested funds from his or her bank account, it would be just and reasonable that he or she should have to bear the liabilities of, or enjoy the profits from, such investment, so long as the original funds used for that investment were restored to the common pool (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Choo Nancy and another appeal</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong </span><span class="font-italic">Lin</span>”) at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the present case, a further benefit would accrue if both the delineation and valuation dates for the bank accounts were set as the IJ Date: this would minimise the incentive for, and any subsequent argument about, issues of wrongful dissipation from these accounts post-IJ. Particularly in relation to bank accounts, this would enable much desired simplicity and certainty in the litigation process. Indeed, at least in the present case, if the court held otherwise that the valuation date of such liquid assets was the date of the ancillaries hearing, which took place long after the IJ Date and after both parties had clearly started to lead separately financial lives utilising funds from their largely segregated bank accounts, unfairness may result from the division process: neither party would had been able to expend what they commonly and reasonably hold to be separate funds with a peace of mind. Instead, going forward, a perverse incentive for attempted dissipation in the interim between the date of the IJ and the date of the ancillaries hearing may be created in the shadow of the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In considering the above, a distinction may usefully be drawn between bank accounts and other kinds of assets. This is because funds in bank accounts are by their nature easily moved or spent; concerns about deterring wrongful dissipation and permitting legitimate expenditures thus come prominently to the fore. In contrast, different considerations often underlie the division of other properties. In particular, for real properties, values may fluctuate significantly between the date of the IJ and the date of the ancillaries hearing. The accommodation needs of the family may require realisation of particular properties:  in a falling market, if the valuation date is much earlier, hardship may arise; conversely, in a rising market a division using too early a valuation may result in the allocation carrying an unintended and uneven windfall effect. In this context, the Court of Appeal has allowed, in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [39], that “there is nothing to preclude the court from applying different cut-off dates to different categories of assets if the circumstances so warrant”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In the result, I chose the figures of the funds in these accounts that were closest to the IJ Date for the asset pool.

</div> While joint contribution was conceded for some assets, these were in varying proportions, and the Husband contended that the Wife made no financial contribution at all to his Medical Practice or the motor vehicle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [33]), the statutory<span class="font-italic"> imprimatur</span> of s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) requires the court to consider and apply the methodology that would result in a “just and equitable” division of the matrimonial assets based on the facts of each case. In my view, the following fact patterns may render the classification methodology more suitable than the global assessment methodology:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where an adverse inference is drawn against a party in relation to one class of asset and the court wishes to confine the consequences of that adverse inference to the relevant class of assets (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> at [33]; <span class="font-italic">BJZ v BKA</span> [2013] SGHC 149 at [73]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where there is a clear reason to make a different <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>”) calculation in relation to a class of assets. In this regard, because indirect contributions are to be assessed in hindsight with full appreciation of the context of the marriage, the ratio for indirect contributions should remain constant in relation to all assets even under the classification methodology (see <span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR</span> [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [22]-[23]). There could, nonetheless, be reason to attribute a different direct contribution ratio to a specific class of assets (see,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> TNC v TND </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1172 at [44] and <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC </span>at [35] where pre-marriage properties were differentiated), or to use a different weightage of the direct and indirect ratios in the third stage of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> analysis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In this case, the Husband’s submission urging the classification methodology appeared to be premised primarily upon the fact that the parties had made different direct and financial contributions to different matrimonial assets.

</div>
</div> He pointed out that his direct contribution featured in varying strength across the entire range of the matrimonial assets, whereas the Wife’s direct contribution was limited to specific matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I did not accept the Husband’s submission. In this case, all of the matrimonial assets were accumulated during the marriage and represented the result of the parties’ joint efforts. The Wife’s support would have assisted the Husband across the range of financial acquisitions over the course of the marriage. The Husband’s greater direct contribution was a natural incidence of his higher income. A mere variance in direct contributions to different assets did not in itself militate against the global assessment methodology. Indeed, to granulate each asset in a class of its own simply because of a variance in direct contribution would not be desirable. In such cases where variation in direct contribution is the only factor in play, two points of principle favour the global assessment methodology. First, this methodology aligns with “the legislative mandate to… treat all matrimonial assets as community property… to be divided in accordance with s 112 of the [WC]” (<span class="font-italic">Lock </span><span class="font-italic">Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) at [40]). Secondly, this legislative mandate, consonant with the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> (at [30]), is one that ought to be exercised in broad strokes, premised upon the court’s feel as to what is just and equitable on the facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Several reasons could ground good rationale to these points of principle. First, an over-intensive scrutiny of the minutiae of family accounts is often impractical. There may be motivations or habits underlying how spouses plan their finances and expenditures during the subsistence of the marriage, which could be arbitrary or tacit, upon which the law is unable to, and in any event should not, intrude. Thus, the High Court stated in <span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS</span> [2010] 4 SLR 617 (at [22]), that “in most marriage partnerships it is largely fortuitous as to which party contributes direct towards the acquisition of matrimonial assets… and which party pays for other family expenditure”. The same fortuity exists in respect of how spouses in ordinary relationships apportion their finances towards the acquisition of different matrimonial assets. If varying contributions to different assets could in itself justify a different substantive outcome in the division of matrimonial assets, the court may be seeking meaning where none can – and should – be found.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Given such practicalities of married life, the court should be slow to adopt any practice that could well subvert “the philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership” (<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”) at [44]).  Parties do not live their lives in anticipation of marital breakdown, nor should they feel compelled or incentivised to do so by legal rules which attempt to unravel and colour the intricacies of their familial decisions <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>. Viewing the fruit of their marriage in a holistic manner, in general, better upholds the institution of marriage as a partnership of joint efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A third and more general point is that in the general run of family cases, simplicity could be an integral aspect of access to justice. Thus, Thorpe LJ observed (at [22]) in the English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Parra v Parra</span> [2003] 1 FLR 942 (“<span class="font-italic">Parra</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judgment that emerged is a tribute to the judge's exhaustive investigation of a mass of detailed evidence. The result is painstakingly thorough. But <span class="font-italic">the outcome of ancillary relief cases depends upon the exercise of a singularly broad judgment that obviates the need for the investigation of minute detail</span> and equally the need to make findings on minor issues in dispute. The judicial task is very different from the task of the judge in the civil justice system whose obligation is to make findings on all issues in dispute relevant to outcome.

To the extent that the Husband was relying on his greater direct contribution (compared to the Wife’s) in absolute terms, both the global assessment and classification methodologies, appropriately applied, were equally capable of addressing his concern. The Husband further suggested that the classification methodology would lead to a more just and equitable division as the matrimonial assets had been acquired and utilised for different purposes.

Similarly, parties ought to consider whether polarising their children would bring any value to their case, as the court, in considering the reliability of such evidence, is well aware of the unique pressures that such witnesses face.

</div> As the Court of Appeal clearly emphasised – and I reiterate – “the hearing of the ancillaries is <span class="font-italic">not </span>intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct” [emphasis in original] (at [25]). Only misconduct that is both <span class="font-italic">extreme </span>and <span class="font-italic">undisputed</span> should be taken into consideration when the court exercises its powers under s 112(1) of the WC to order the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the circumstances, I was of the view that a 63:37 ratio in favour of the Wife was fair as Step 2 of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>framework. This was a long marriage: 27 years until the IJ Date, and 24 years until the date of their separation. The Wife had been the primary caregiver of the children, although the Husband did play his part. The Wife also stayed home for more than four years to look after the children. The parties were likely to have been, by and large, content with the marriage for some 20 years, during which they achieved much as a couple, raising their children and building significant assets through joint sacrifice and effort. While the Husband moved out in the last four years, the Wife continued to look after the home and the children. The unhappiness on each side in the last 6 years or so must be seen in context and not form a bitter lens through which the entirety of their 27 years of family life is viewed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 3: Final ratio for division</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 A simple average of the two ratios above yielded an overall divisional ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Husband. In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>, the Court of Appeal set out three relevant and non-exhaustive factors in determining if the relative weightage of the ratios should be adjusted: (a) the size of the matrimonial pool, (b) the duration of the marriage, and (c) the nature and extent of the parties’ indirect contributions (at [27]). The Wife submitted that the derived ratio should be adjusted in her favour as the appreciation of the two real properties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Property and the Shophouse) was the result of her persevering efforts during the marriage and her looking after, furnishing, and decorating the Property.

</div>
</div> As for the Husband, he submitted that the ratio should be adjusted in his favour due to (a) the Wife’s rent-free occupation of the Property since the parties separated, and (b) the inequity of the situation where, according to him, he held the family together while the Wife disregarded him and carried on with her clubbing and drinking lifestyle.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my judgment, there was no need for any adjustment to the average of the ratios. The matrimonial pool in this case was not extraordinarily large. The length of marriage was relatively long, and it was the <span class="font-italic">collective</span> effort of the parties that had built up the family’s pool of assets. The direct contributions of the Husband were enabled only by the indirect contributions and sacrifices on the part of the Wife, particularly given that she had stayed home to take care of the children while they were at their youngest and most demanding. Further, the rent-free occupation during the period of separation was a voluntary act on the part of the Husband,

</div> and subsisted only for the last four years. During this period, the children of the marriage also continued to live with the Wife in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Accordingly, in the round, the final ratio for division was 60:40 in favour of the Husband. This was a fair and equitable outcome taking into account all the circumstances and the ups and downs of their marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In coming to this particular division, two countervailing considerations were in play as I contextualised the Court of Appeal’s illuminating guidance in <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>(at [30]) that: “The controlling principle has always been and remains that the court must approach the exercise with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the facts of the case.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The first was a consideration of two precedents in marriages of similar length: <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter</span> [2012] 4 SLR 785, where the Court of Appeal applied equal division in a marriage of 28 years, and <span class="font-italic">Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Mee Lan v Chan Kai Buan</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659, a High Court decision which has been cited by the Court of Appeal on many occasions, where equal division was applied in a marriage of 26 years. In both of these marriages of similar length, the wives made no direct financial contributions. In this case, the Wife had made some direct financial contribution, and the Husband had played his part at home. Parties had cooperated in the partnership of marriage over many years, and indeed, on the precedents, a range of up to half of the matrimonial assets was open to consideration, if such a division was just and equitable. I had in mind, nevertheless, a second consideration: that the Husband lived and worked at the Shophouse. After the marriage broke down, he had graciously moved out of the matrimonial home, allowing the Wife and their sons use of the Property during their period of separation. Whilst this was not itself a reason to adjust the Wife’s ratio downwards, it was in my view a fair reason not to adjust it upwards either. It would not be equitable if the division compelled the Husband to liquidate the Shophouse or his Medical Practice at this stage in his life. In the circumstances, allocation of 40% of the assets to the Wife met both imperatives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For the foregoing reasons, a 60:40 division in favour of the Husband, on the facts of this particular case, was in my judgment just and equitable: it gave appropriate dignity to their joint achievements together over the years to build home and hearth, and at the same time, left each party with a sound platform from which to move forward with their lives. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implementation of asset division orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Wife’s 40% share of the total matrimonial assets was about S$2,870,945. Taking into account the assets in her name, she should be paid the remainder due of around S$2,357,161, out of the proceeds of sale of the Property. Both parties had indicated that they wished to sell the Property during the ancillaries hearing.
