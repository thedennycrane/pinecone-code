<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This Originating Summons No 1034 of 2009
                    (“OS 1034”) was brought, initially, in the name of [MC] under the
                    Inheritance (Family Provision) Act (Cap 138, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“IFPA”). OS 1034 was amended to enable the plaintiff, [APZ]
                    (hereafter referred to as “the son” or “the
                    plaintiff”) to sue by his mother, [MC], as his litigation representative
                    (“the mother”). The defendants are the daughters of the deceased,
                    [MB] from his first marriage. They were named in OS 1034 as the trustees of the
                    estate of their late father. Counsel for the defendants, Mr Andrew Tan,
                    informed the court that the second defendant, [D], had renounced Probate.
                    Accordingly, Grant of Probate was issued in favour of the first defendant, [AQA]
                    on 26 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The mother was married to [MB] on 21 April
                    1998. At the time of the marriage, the mother was 34 years old, and [MB] was
                    considerably older, 68. The son was born on 13 June 1998. He suffers from
                    Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
                    (ADHD). In May 2001, [MB] commenced divorce proceedings, and a Decree Nisi was
                    granted on 15 May 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the hearing on ancillary matters on
                    25 May 2005, DJ Laura Lau, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    ordered:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Lump sum maintenance of $20,000 to the
                            mother;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Monthly sum of $650 as maintenance for the
                            son;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A sum of $21,478.44, being the net sale proceeds
                            of the matrimonial flat, to be divided equally between [MB] and the
                            mother.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties appealed against the 25 May
                    2005 Order. In her appeal, the mother prayed, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, for lump sum maintenance of $200,000 for the son, and lump
                    sum maintenance of $30,000 for herself. The cross appeals in RAS 720042/2005 and
                    RAS 720043/2005 were dismissed by Justice Tan Lee Meng on 25 January 2006.
                    The neutral citation of DJ Lau’s written Grounds of Decision is <em>MB v MC</em> [2005] SGDC 181.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A few months later, the mother tried to vary the
                    25 May 2005 Order by filing Summons No 650212/2006 (“the 2006
                    Summons”). In the 2006 Summons, the mother wanted:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">[MB] to pay maintenance for the son at $2,500 per
                            month, alternatively, a lump sum of $250,000 for the son;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">[MB] to pay the mother a sum of $1,000 per month,
                            alternatively, a lump sum of $100,000.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 2006 Summons was dismissed by DJ Khoo Oon
                    Soo on 11 November 2006. The mother’s appeal was dismissed by Tay Yong
                    Kwang J with no order as to costs on 7 March 2007. In his ruling, Tay J
                    cautioned the mother about future costs orders if she persisted in taking out
                    unmeritorious applications and appeals (see <em>MB v
                        MC</em> [2008] SGHC 246 at [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The mother filed Summons No 650228/2008
                    (“the 2008 Summons”) on 24 June 2008. The 2008 Summons was
                    heard by DJ Regina Ow. On this occasion, the mother limited her claim to lump
                    sum maintenance of $250,000 for both her son and herself. DJ Ow dismissed the
                    2008 Summons. The mother’s appeal was also dismissed by Woo Bih Li J on
                    14 November 2008. On appeal, it was made known that the lump sum
                    maintenance of $250,000 was for the son only. The neutral citation of Woo
                    J’s written Grounds of Decision is <em>MB v MC</em>
                    [2008] SGHC 246.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Several months before the 2008 Summons was taken
                    out, [MB] made a new Will to replace an earlier one executed on 28 February
                    2001. In his Last Will and Testament dated 9 April 2008 (“the 2008
                    Will”), [MB] made two specific bequeaths: (a) $10,000 to the son, and (b)
                    $5,000 to the mother. The residue of the estate, after payment of [MB]’s
                    debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, was to be divided between [MB]’s
                    two daughters, [AQA] and [D] in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       [MB] died on 23 January 2009. At the time
                    of his death, [MB] and the mother were divorced. The mother believed that
                    $10,000 was grossly insufficient for her autistic son.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The mother applied under
                    s 3(1)(c) of the IFPA for an order that reasonable provision for the
                    plaintiff’s maintenance be made out of [MB]’s estate (hereafter
                    referred to as “the Estate”). Although there were short arguments
                    on s 3(1)(d), counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Irving Choh, later on
                    confirmed that the application was not made under s 3(1)(d) of the
                        IFPA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> At the
                    time of the application, the plaintiff was about 11 years old. In all her
                    affidavits filed in OS 1034, the mother had insisted on a lump sum payment of
                    $250,000 as maintenance for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I dismissed the application on 19 November
                    2010. I made no order as to costs. The plaintiff has appealed against my
                    decision. I now set out the reasons for dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 3 of the IFPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is worthwhile setting out the provisions of
                    s 3 of the IFPA in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Power for court to order payment out of net estate of deceased for benefit
                        of surviving spouse or child.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if the court on application by or on behalf of any such wife,
                        husband, daughter or son as aforesaid (referred to in this Act as a
                        dependant of the deceased) is of opinion that the disposition of the
                        deceased’s estate effected by his will, or the law relating to
                        intestacy, or the combination of his will and that law, is not such as to
                        make reasonable provision for the maintenance of that dependant, the court
                        may order that such reasonable provision as the court thinks fit shall,
                        subject to such conditions or restrictions, if any, as the court may impose,
                        be made out of the deceased’s net estate for the maintenance of that
                        dependant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that no application shall be made to the court by or on behalf of
                        any person in any case where the disposition of a deceased’s estate
                        effected as aforesaid is such that the surviving spouse is entitled to not
                        less than two-thirds of the income of the net estate and where the only
                        other dependant or dependants, if any, is or are a child or children of the
                        surviving spouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The provision for maintenance to be made by an order shall, subject to
                        subsection (4), be by way of periodical payments and the order shall
                        provide for their termination not later than —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) in the case of a wife or husband, her or his remarriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) in the case of a daughter who has not been married, or who is under

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) in the case of a son under disability, the cesser of his disability,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Periodical payments made under subsection (2) to any one

                        in respect of the same period, the aggregate of the annual rates at which
                        those payments are made shall not exceed the annual income of the net
                        estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Where the value of a deceased’s net estate does not exceed
                        $50,000, the court shall have power to make an order providing for
                        maintenance, in whole or in part, by way of a lump sum payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) In determining whether, and in what way, and as from what date,
                        provision for maintenance ought to be made by an order, the court shall have
                        regard to the nature of the property representing the deceased’s net
                        estate and shall not order any such provision to be made as would
                        necessitate a realisation that would be improvident having regard to the
                        interests of the deceased’s dependants and of the person who, apart
                        from the order, would be entitled to that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) The court shall, on any application made under this Act, have regard
                        to any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the
                        dependant of the deceased to whom the application relates, to the conduct of
                        that dependant in relation to the deceased and otherwise, and to any other
                        matter or thing which in the circumstances of the case the court may
                        consider relevant or material in relation to that dependant, to persons
                        interested in the estate of the deceased, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7) The court shall also, on any such application, have regard to the
                        deceased’s reasons, so far as ascertainable, for making the
                        dispositions made by his will (if any), or for refraining from disposing by
                        will of his estate or part of his estate, or for not making any provision,
                        or any further provision, as the case may be, for a dependant, and the court
                        may accept such evidence of those reasons as it considers sufficient
                        including any statement in writing signed by the deceased and dated, so,
                        however, that in estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to any such
                        statement the court shall have regard to all the circumstances from which
                        any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the
                        statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8) The court in considering for the purposes of subsection (1),
                        whether the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by the law
                        relating to intestacy, or by the combination of the deceased’s will
                        and that law, makes reasonable provision for the maintenance of a dependant
                        shall not be bound to assume that the law relating to intestacy makes
                        reasonable provision in all</p>

                        adopting the IFP (UK) Act 1938 because it had worked well in England, he

                        s 9A of the Interpretation Act, we are obliged to give effect to such

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussions and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was OS 1034 a proper application?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     OS 1034 was the latest set of proceedings in a
                    history of litigation involving many ancillary applications and appeals under
                    the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) when [MB] was alive, and now
                    against his Estate under the IFPA. There was no dispute that the plaintiff being
                    an infant son was a “dependent of the deceased” and eligible to
                    make an application under s 3(1)(c) of the IFPA. For the purposes of the
                    IFPA, I agreed with the defendants that the net value of the Estate was
                    $454,709.71.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff was a beneficiary under the 2008
                    Will. It is for the plaintiff suing by his litigation representative to prove
                    his case. In the context of this case, the defendants were left with the residue
                    of the net Estate which their father meant them to have when he made the 2008
                    Will. By making an order under the IFPA, the court would be invading or
                    interfering with what would be normally a testator’s privilege to dispose
                    of his own money in his own way. The relevant words of s 3(1) are
                    “if the court ... is of the opinion that the Will does not make
                    reasonable provision”
                    <em>not</em> that the testator has acted unreasonably. The
                    first question is whether the specific bequeath of $10,000 being “the
                    disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by his Will ... is not such
                    as to make reasonable provision for the maintenance” of the infant son, a
                    dependant of the deceased within the meaning of s 3(1). If the court finds
                    that it was unreasonable that the disposition made no provision or not a larger
                    provision, the second question then arises: What provision should be made out of
                    the deceased’s net estate for the maintenance of the dependant? There is
                    likely to be an overlap, evidentially, between the first and second questions.
                    In considering the questions, the court will have regard to all the
                    circumstances, including the history of previous proceedings which I have
                    related in brief. In addition, the court will also look at s 3(6) and
                    s 3(7) in coming to a conclusion as to whether [MB] in his 2008 Will had
                    made reasonable provision for the infant son. The opening sentence of
                    sub-sections (6) and (7) is unambiguous. It states that “the court shall,
                    on any application made under this Act... ” to the matters referred to in
                    the respective sub-sections. Before me, counsel did not touch on s 3(5) of
                    the IFPA. Nevertheless, s 3(5) is also relevant depending on the facts and
                    circumstances. For present purposes, suffice it to say that under
                    sub-section (5), the court should not order any provision that would
                    necessitate a realisation that would be improvident having regard to the
                    interests of the deceased’s dependant and of the person, who would, apart
                    from the order, would be entitled to that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It must be stated here at the outset that a
                    number of factors taken cumulatively weighed heavily against granting the
                    application. One major difficulty with this case was the affidavit evidence of
                    the mother which had been embellished with half-truths and exaggerations. She
                    had plainly contradicted herself in her affidavits. There were serious concerns
                    about the veracity of her affidavit evidence. I will elaborate in the
                    discussions below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In OS 1034, the mother’s contention was
                    that [MB]’s bequeath of $10,000 under the 2008 Will was grossly
                    insufficient for her autistic son. In all her affidavits filed in OS 1034, she
                    had insisted on $250,000 as her son’s maintenance, and that a lump sum
                    payment was to be ordered out of the Estate. If the figure of $250,000 sounded
                    familiar, it was because it was the same amount that the mother had wanted from
                    [MB] way back in 2006 and 2008. In fact, the mother deposed to her unsuccessful
                    applications in paragraphs 16 and 17 of her 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Affidavit filed in support of OS 1034 on 8 September 2009. In the 2006 Summons,
                    she asked for lump sum maintenance of $250,000 for her son; and a further lump
                    sum maintenance of $100,000 for herself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Additional maintenance
                    was sought by her even though she had been awarded lump sum maintenance of
                    $20,000 by DJ Lau, and on appeal to Tan J, she had asked that her award be
                    increased by $10,000 to $30,000. I think it is useful to look at DJ Lau’s
                    reasons for granting lump sum maintenance of $20,000. It was a short marriage.
                    It lasted for four years up to its dissolution by the grant of the Decree Nisi.
                    However, [MB] had ceased to have contact with the mother after 12 March 2001.
                    Thus, the parties were together for slightly less than three years. The parting
                    was described by DJ Lau to be highly acrimonious, and she decided that a clean
                    break was desirable. In the DJ’s opinion, the sum of $20,000 would enable
                    the mother to adjust herself to her situation (see [30] of DJ Lau’s grounds of decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the 2008 Summons, the mother sought lump
                    sum maintenance of $250,000 for herself and her son. Before Woo J, she changed
                    her mind, and the hearing of the appeal proceeded on the basis that the lump sum
                    maintenance of $250,000 was for the son.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> How the figure of
                    $250,000 was derived was not stated. It is worthwhile repeating Woo J’s
                    astute remarks at [14]. He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Wife’s cancer and the child’s ADHD were already known and
                        taken into account by DJ Lau when she made the 25 May 2005 order and must
                        have been known by the other courts which heard the appeals and applications
                        I set out above [this included Tay J’s ruling]. From the Wife’s
                        affidavits and submissions for the 2008 Summons and the appeal which I
                        heard, <em>I was of the view that the real reasons for the
                            2008 Summons and the appeal was that the Wife was concerned over the old
                            age of the Husband and wanted a share of the sale proceeds of the JU
                            property. I was of the view that the Wife had used her child (and
                            herself) as a reason to get the $250,000 lump sum
                        maintenance</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By way of brief background, [MB] owned a property known as [JU] and he
                    sold it in 2005 for $2.7m. It was not matrimonial property, and the mother had
                    no claim against it. As Woo Bih Li J noted his decision in <em>MB v MC</em> [2008] SGHC 246, the [JU] property was
                    already dealt with at the ancillaries, and the in-principle question of lump sum
                    maintenance for the son was already considered by DJ Lau and other
                    judges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Tan for the defendants reminded that
                    it was therefore no coincidence that the mother asked for $250,000 in the
                    present proceedings. It was exactly the same amount she had sought in her past
                    ancillary applications and appeals. Being without merits, the ancillary
                    applications and/or appeals were dismissed. This similar fact had prompted the
                    defendants to question the real motive behind the present proceedings. Judicial
                    observations showed that the mother had an obsessive approach in bringing
                    proceedings devoid of merits, unarguable, and had refused to take no for an
                    answer. Her conduct was even discredited by Woo J who saw through her ploy to
                    use her child to get lump sum maintenance of $250,000 when the real reason for
                    filing the 2008 Summons was that she wanted a share of the sale proceeds of the
                    [JU] Property. The mother’s gripe had always been that [MB] had given the
                    sale proceeds to his daughters from his first marriage, but nothing to her and
                    the son. In the present application, she repeated the same dissatisfaction and
                    unhappiness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The mother had attributed the value of the
                    Estate at $565,457.23 based on figures lifted from the Schedule of Assets filed
                    in OS Probate No. DCP 360/2009/W. The first defendant pointed out that the
                    Schedule of Assets comprised trust accounts for [MB]’s grandsons.
                    Therefore, a sum totalling $107,219.18 held in the trust accounts had to be
                    excluded thereby leaving the net value of the Estate at $454,709.71.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> I
                    agreed with the defendants’ position. Be that as it may, on either
                    opposing views, the value of the Estate far exceeded the prescribed limit of
                    $50,000 in s 3(4) of the IFPA. Section 3(4) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the value of a deceased’s net estate does not exceed $50,000,
                        the court shall have power to make an order providing for maintenance, in
                        whole or in part, by way of a lump sum payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The wording of s 3(4) is clear. In the
                    context of the IFPA, the Estate is not a small estate as it was more than
                    $50,000. Hence, the court had no statutory power to order lump sum payment as
                    the net value of the Estate far exceeded the statutory limit of $50,000 (see
                    s 3(4) of the IFPA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The purpose of the IFPA is limited to the
                    provision of reasonable maintenance. Therefore, if an order for provision of
                    maintenance is to be made under s 3(1), the statutorily prescribed method
                    for provision of maintenance out of the net estate is by way of periodical
                    payments until the infant son reaches 21, or in any case his earlier death (see
                    s 3(2) of the IFPA). Crucially, maintenance is provided by the payment of
                    some part of the income of the estate. Hence, the periodic payments under
                    s 3(3) cannot be for an annual rate that exceeded the annual income of the
                    net estate. By s 2 of the IFPA,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“annual income" means, in relation to the net estate of a deceased
                        person, the income that the net estate might be expected at the date of the
                        order made under this Act, when realised, to yield in a year; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“net estate” means all the property of which a deceased
                        person had power to dispose by his will (otherwise than by virtue of a
                        special power of appointment) less the amount of his funeral, testamentary
                        and administration expenses, debts and liabilities and estate duty payable
                        out of his estate on his death;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Consequently, the annual income of the estate should be calculated
                    based on what the net value of the testator’s estate might be expected to
                    yield when realised <em>at the date of an order made under the
                        IFPA</em>. Furthermore, the words “when realised” in
                    s 2 of the IFPA suggest, as a matter of construction, that the annual
                    income must be received by the estate before it can be distributed. Above all,
                    it is significant that the legislation does not empower the court to award a
                    lump sum by way of capitalisation of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Given the net value of the Estate, right from
                    the very outset (<em>ie</em>, as early as 1 September
                    2009 when the mother affirmed her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit in
                    support of OS 1034), it was obvious that the plaintiff would not be entitled to
                    a lump sum payment under the IFPA. Yet in all her affidavits, the mother had
                    repeatedly insisted on $250,000 as lump sum payment which was a sum equal to
                    approximately 54% of the net value of the Estate (<em>ie</em>, $454,709.71). The mother’s insistence on lump sum
                    payment could not have been misguided since she was legally represented
                    throughout the proceedings. In my view, she was plainly after capital payment
                    out of the Estate, and the claim of $250,000 as presented and advanced on behalf
                    of the plaintiff was only explicable as legacy, and not maintenance. I reached
                    this conclusion after closely studying the mother’s affidavit evidence,
                    and the written submissions tendered on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     OS 1034 was the mother’s chance to use
                    her son’s condition to try once again to win the elusive $250,000; this
                    time through the IFPA for a bigger slice of the Estate. In light of the
                    provisions in s 3 of the IFPA, I found her reasons for lump sum payment
                    really dubious. My view that the claim in OS 1034 was for capital payment is an
                    important point which I want to flag here because of the objective of the IFPA.
                    To reiterate, the purpose of the IFPA is limited to the provision of reasonable
                    maintenance; the legislation is not for the purpose of obtaining legacies out of
                    the testator’s estate. Moreover, outside of s 3(4), the IFPA does not
                    envisage any capital payment, and the court is not empowered to make such an
                    order. See generally <em>In Re Vrint</em> [1940] 3 All
                    ER 470. My view is reinforced by the fact that the characterisation of the
                    claim as maintenance was illusory. The basis of $250,000 or how the $250,000 was
                    derived was never explained, and curiously, by her subsequent admission that the
                    amount of $250,000 was insufficient to cover the infant son’s maintenance
                    until he reached age 21.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I
                    will now elaborate on the points made in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The mother’s affidavits filed in OS 1034
                    talked about the sale of the [JU] property for $2.7m; that [MB] gave away the
                    sale proceeds to his daughters, and not a cent to the son and her; that the
                    value of the Estate was $565,457.23 (and not $$454,709.71), but [MB] left them
                    $15,000 collectively under the 2008 Will; that the daughters were financially
                    well off; and that even after deducting $250,000, the Estate would still have a
                    balance sum of $315,457.23. In her 6<sup>th</sup> Affidavit
                    filed on 24 June 2010, the mother again voiced her dissatisfaction with the
                    small bequeath of $10,000 to her son as compared to $107,219.18 set aside in
                    trust accounts for [MB] ’s grandsons. To her, the grandsons were
                    adequately provided for, but in the case of her son, [MB] had left him very
                    little.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The mother in her
                        1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit deposed that $3,265 was the monthly
                    expenses of <em>both</em> mother and son. She even produced
                    a table with figures itemising the expenses (at paragraph 14). However, eight
                    months later, without explanation and using the same figures that appeared in
                    the table in her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit, she surprisingly
                    claimed in paragraph 5 of her 5<sup>th</sup> Affidavit of
                    28 June 2010 that the sum of $3,265 was her son’s monthly personal
                    expenses. I did not believe her. Some of the items in the table were meant for
                    mother and son, and this point is elaborated below. Furthermore, the lie in
                    paragraph 5 is plain for all to see from the explanation note to the expenditure
                    itemised as “Miscellaneous Expenses” where she stated:
                    “Miscellaneous Expenses” included expenses for “stationery,
                    clothes, etc. for my son and myself.” In her
                        5<sup>th</sup> Affidavit, the mother claimed a further sum
                    of $1,702 per month for medication, consultation, therapy and private tuition.
                    She estimated her son’s total monthly expenses to be $4,967. For ease of
                    reading, a breakdown of the monthly expenses is now set out:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Going down the list, items like rent for the
                    flat, food, miscellaneous expenses, telephone and utilities bills were for the
                    son and mother’s monthly expenses, and it would be double-counting to
                    simply compute them into the reasonable provision calculus. The mother listed
                    the full rate of school fees at [E] School even though a subsidy was available.
                    Third, the mother’s figure of $1,702 per month for medication,
                    consultation and therapy was grossly out of step with the estimates provided by
                    Dr [F], the son’s consultant psychiatrist at [G] Clinic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The mother’s figure was almost four
                    times higher than Dr [F]’s most conservative course of treatment which was
                    estimated at $5,245 per year (<em>ie</em>, $437.08 per
                    month). Even if I were to take Dr [F]’s most intensive course of treatment
                    at $8,820 per year (<em>ie</em> $735 per month), the
                    mother’s figure would still be more than two times higher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As I pointed out, the mother did not explain
                    how the lump sum figure of $250,000 was derived. It was fanciful, and this
                    explained why she was not able to correlate it with her calculations for monthly
                    expenses, which were inflated. She must have realised this for in her 5th
                    Affidavit, she made an about turn when she suddenly introduced the word
                    “subsidy” in an attempt to explain the claim figure of $250,000.
                    To her, the figure of $250,000 was a “subsidy” because it would
                    not be sufficient to meet all the monthly expenses of her son until he turned 21
                        (<em>ie</em>, in 125 months) leaving her to pay the
                    monthly balance of $2,967. By her computation, the figure of $250,000 would work
                    out to $2,000 per month ($250,000 ÷ 125) and was, thus,
                    inadequate as monthly expenses were $4,967. Earlier, in written submissions of
                    26 March 2010, the same lump figure was sought. Mr Choh stated that
                    the plaintiff was merely asking for a lump sum of $250,000 which works out to be
                    a monthly sum of $2,000 until the plaintiff turns 21.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Indeed, if the mother’s
                    contention that $250,000 was a “subsidy” and that she would have
                    to pay the difference is to be believed, then she could not be in as bad a
                    financial position as she had tried to portray. I have highlighted her
                    contradictions and inconsistencies in her affidavits. In my judgment, all these
                    inconsistencies can be taken into account as relevant to reinforce the
                    conclusion that she wanted all along a legacy out of the Estate, and not
                    maintenance in the sense presented and generally understood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There were other material contradictions. For
                    instance, in paragraph 21 of her 1st Affidavit, the mother claimed that the
                    application in OS 1034 was taken “out of extreme and genuine financial
                    desperation”; that she has had no maintenance for her son since the death
                    of [MB]; that the figure of $3,265 was the monthly expenses of both mother and
                        son;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and that she was in poor health,
                    could not work and was in debt. Some three months later, she filed her
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit. Her position then was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I am unable to earn enough for my son’s necessary expenses.
                        However, his late father’s estate has sufficient funds to do
                            so.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">In paragraph 18, she deposed that she does “not have the
                    financial means any more to take care of [her] son”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now come to plaintiff’s written
                    submissions of 2 August 2010. Paragraph 32 of the submissions repeated
                    paragraph 21 of her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit - that is to say,
                    the present application was “made out of desperation and purely for
                    survival”. Significantly, the revelation that the money was to buy a
                    property as her motive for the application exposed the lies in the
                    mother’s affidavit evidence outlined above. At [30], it was submitted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the sum of S$250,000.00 is given to the Plaintiff, the mother intends
                        to purchase a Property for the Plaintiff so that the Plaintiff can benefit
                        from the growth of the investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I agreed with Mr Tan that plainly the
                    mother’s intention to use the money to purchase a property contradicted
                    the dire need for monthly maintenance, and everything else relating thereto and
                    deposed to in her affidavits. As Mr Tan pointed out, she was not without
                    financial means as she had wanted the court to believe. All things considered,
                    Mr Tan questioned the mother’s sincerity in making the application.
                    He maintained that in truth the application for reasonable maintenance was a
                    “facade”. In my view, the mother’s aspiration is for the
                    plaintiff to live in his own home rather than in rented accommodation, but it is
                    not the object of the IFPA to bring about such an improvement from the Estate.
                    As stated, the object of the legislation is to provide maintenance for persons
                    of the classes mentioned by way of periodic payment of some part of the income
                    of the estate. As a corollary, the court is not empowered to order capital
                    payment where the net value of the estate exceeds $50,000. In short, the IFPA
                    would not operate in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I now take up Mr Tan’s point that
                    the mother had not disclosed her true financial position, and his point is
                    related to her contradictions, and hence the veracity of her affidavit evidence.
                    In her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit, she claimed at [19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I cannot work and earn any stable income. My income is 0. My son and I
                        cannot depend on my brother, sister and mother for financial help, but they
                        cannot help me indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2009 was submitted as
                    proof of nil income. The plaintiff’s submissions of 2 August 2010
                    also noted that the mother was “a recovering cancer patient who is
                    presently 47 years of old and, she herself cannot even work properly to earn a
                    fix and steady income at all.” However, the cancer had been in remission
                    for over 19 years now, and this ought not affect her ability to earn a fix and
                    steady income, for instance, in her last stated occupation as a housing agent
                    with an earning capacity of $2,000-$3,000 per month (<em>MB v
                        MC</em> [2005] SGDC 181 at [19]-[21]). At the
                    hearing of the ancillaries, DJ Lau had castigated the mother as a manipulative
                    person. At [20], DJ Lau
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To my mind, the wife was a manipulative woman who forced the husband to
                        part with large sums of money which were meant for his old age. Thus, it is
                        not inconceivable that the wife had either concealed her true income in 2001
                        or had drastically reduced her income by deliberate means in order to
                        portray herself as living from hand to mouth and thereby her claim for
                        maintenance for both herself and the child. Indeed, the wife claimed a hefty
                        $300,000 to $500,000 as maintenance for herself and the child at first
                        instance. It is more than mere coincidence that the wife had purportedly
                        suffered a severe financial setback in 2001 which was also the year the
                        husband commenced divorce proceedings against her. In this connection, the
                        wife’s non-disclosure of her income from 2002 onwards is
                        telling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Like DJ Lau, Woo J, in dismissing
                    the 2008 Summons, was critical of the mother (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). The omission of the mother’s income from 2009
                    onwards was glaring. There was also no evidence to corroborate her bald
                    allegation that her family had assisted her financially. Given the duplicity of
                    the mother, it was not reliable to accept her evidence in the absence of
                    corroboration by contemporaneous documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     By all accounts, in my judgment, the
                    application was to obtain a $250,000 legacy out of the Estate. For these
                    reasons, this application could not stand and was duly dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For completeness, I will now comment on some
                    of the arguments raised, but not necessarily in the order in which they were
                    raised at the hearings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 3(3): Annual income and annual rate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The affidavits did not deal with s 3(3)
                    of the IFPA. While the defendants confirmed the net value of the Estate at
                    $454,709.71, there was no estimate of its annual income. This omission was not
                    unexpected given their defence. On the part of the plaintiff, even after a
                    four-week adjournment at the request of Mr Choh to deal with
                        s 3(3),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> the plaintiff did not muster any
                    evidence other than a bald statement on annual income at [46] of the plaintiff’s submissions of
                    16 September 2010 which stated: “a skilful investor may even yield a
                    sum of $100,000.00.” This submission was entirely arbitrary and
                    speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Re Gale</em>
                    [1966] Ch. 236 (<em>“Re
                    Gale”</em>), Harman LJ, in the context of s 1(3) of the
                    UK 1938 Act, which is identical in all material aspects to s 3(3) IFPA,
                    applied a rough and ready figure of 4% which worked out to £640 as the
                    annual income of the net estate which was valued at about £16,000.
                    Diplock LJ and Russell LJ were less precise, being content to hold
                    that the court mandated provision of £600 “probably” did not
                    exceed the statutory ceiling. Harman LJ’s approach of substituting a
                    rough and ready figure is not of general application. Much of the
                    testator’s property in <em>Re Gale</em> consisted of
                    houses subject to the Rent Restriction Act (UK) which produced a residuary
                    income of about £500 pounds annually. This figure was easily ascertainable
                    and provided a convenient and plausible starting point that enabled
                    Harman LJ to devise his figure of £640. In contrast, in the present
                    case, the majority of assets in the Estate consist of shares, and dividend
                    income of each counter would vary. It was not credible to pluck a figure out of
                    the air, especially, where no genuine attempt was made to ascertain the annual
                    income of the Estate. Even if the mother was able to tender a more plausible
                    figure for the annual income of the Estate together with a substantially pared
                    down estimate for the maintenance of the son, I would still dismiss the claim on
                    the basis of s 3(6) and 3(7) of the IFPA which I will now
                discuss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 3(6) of IFPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Section 3(6) of the IFPA requires the court to
                    consider any past, present or future capital or income from any source of the
                    dependant, to the conduct of that dependant in relation to the deceased as well
                    as “any other matter or thing which in the circumstances of the
                    case” that the court finds relevant or material in relation to the
                    dependant or persons interested in the estate of the deceased. In <em>Jeanne Christine Monteiro v Ling Mie Hean &amp; Anor</em>
                    [1997] SGHC 296, it was held that the court should consider any
                        <em>inter vivos</em> gift by the testator to the
                    applicant in determining whether to order reasonable provision for
                    maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, the mother admitted to
                    receiving $127,900 from [MB] during the period between 1998 and
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In addition, the court may take
                    into consideration the 25 May 2005 Order as it is in my view clearly
                    evidence of “any other matter or thing which in the circumstances of the
                    case” the court finds relevant or material in relation to the dependant
                    within the ambit and meaning of s 3(6) of the IFPA. Notably, DJ Lau awarded
                    a half share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial flat to the mother despite
                    her 28.7% contribution on the basis that the sale proceeds would be for the
                    benefit of the mother <em>and</em> son. The equal division
                    also took into consideration that she would have to raise the child on her own
                    (DJ Lau’s GD at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>). In monetary
                    terms, her half share of the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial flat was
                    $10,739.22.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 3(7) of IFPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I now come to s 3(7). Under this
                    sub-section, the court could take cognisance of [MB]’s reasons,
                    objectively ascertained, for not making a larger provision for the son in his
                    2008 Will. Mrs Anne Tan, the solicitor who was instructed by [MB] to draw
                    up his 2008 Will, deposed in her affidavit of 14 May 2010 that the testator
                    had on or about 9 April 2008 wanted to change his earlier Will of
                    28 February 2001. Specifically, he asked that two sums of money for $5,000
                    and $10,000 be given to the mother and the son respectively. As explained in the
                    solicitor’s affidavit at [7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He [the husband] harbours an apprehension that his ex-wife may legally
                        harass his two daughters for more money for herself and her son and felt
                        that, if he had made some monetary provision for them he would be able to
                        keep them at bay after his death. Accordingly his instruction was to give
                        his ex-wife the mother $5,000 and his son $10,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mrs Tan’s evidence is admissible as
                    a matter of law under s 3(7) (see <em>In re Vrint</em>
                    (see above <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) and <em>In
                        re Smallwood, deceased</em> [1951] 1 Ch 369). An express reason by the
                    testator for the monetary provision is relevant to the plaintiff’s claim.
                    It is now convenient to remind that during his lifetime, the mother had on many
                    occasions taken [MB] to court to vary the monthly maintenance of $650 (see
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>-<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). [MB] had faithfully kept up with the monthly payment
                    until his death. In all, [MB] paid a total of $35,100 over a period of 54 months
                    from 1 June 2004 (date of commencement of maintenance payments) to
                    23 January 2009 (death of [MB]). At this monthly rate, the specific
                    bequeaths totally $15,000 would last for approximately 23 months, long enough
                    for the mother and the plaintiff to adjust to the situation (<em>ie</em>, [MB] ’s death).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 4: Time Bar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendants raised a preliminary objection
                    that the application contravened s 4(1) of the IFPA. Section 4(1)
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.—(1) Except as provided by this section or section 6, an
                        order under this Act shall not be made save on an application made within 6
                        months from the date on which representation in regard to the
                        deceased’s estate is first taken out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendants argued that since the date on
                    which “representation in regard to the deceased’s estate was first
                    taken out” referred to the date of filing for Probate (<em>ie</em>, 11 February 2009). In the present case, the
                    plaintiff’s application under the IFPA was taken out on 8 September
                    2009. Since the six months expired on 10 August 2009, the application was
                    time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The defendants’ submission was
                    incorrect. <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> (Vol
                    15, 2006 Reissue) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at [190.320] notes that, “[t]ime
                    only runs from the valid grant of representation.”
                    <em>Re Freeman</em> [1984] 1 WLR 1419 was cited
                    for this proposition. This position is also supported by a local case
                    interpreting s 4 of the IFPA (see <em>Nirmala Devi d/o
                        Vengadasalam v Danalakshmi Nee Krishnan and Ors</em>
                    [1990] SGHC 130).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case, time started to run when
                    the grant of probate was extracted on 6 May 2009. The six-month limitation
                    expired on 5 November 2010. Accordingly, the son’s application under
                    the IFPA on 8 September 2009 was not time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Even if under s 3(1) the court is of the
                    opinion that $10,000 was unreasonable, in considering what order to make under
                    s 3(2), the court will have to consider the matters under ss 3(6) and
                    3(7). In a proper case, it is possible that having regard to the matters to
                    which the court is to pay attention to under s 3(6) and s 3(7), the
                    court may conclude that in the circumstances no provision be ordered. An example
                    is where the court finds that the testator had in his lifetime given substantial
                        <em>inter vivos</em> gifts to the dependant and, hence,
                    concludes that in the circumstances it is reasonable not to grant the
                    application. Put another way, a nil provision may in the end be regarded as a
                    reasonable provision given the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the present case, assuming, for the sake of
                    argument, that the provision of $10,000 in the 2008 Will was unreasonable under
                    s 3(1), and if it was necessary to decide on the matter, the court having
                    regard to the mother’s failure to provide a full and frank account of the
                    son’s monthly expenses, which were unsubstantiated and plainly inflated,
                    as well as the many other factors outlined in [35]-[40], when taken
                    cumulatively would weigh against granting the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In all the circumstances and for the reasons
                    stated, I dismissed the application with no order as to costs since the
                    defendants did not seriously press for costs. I made clear to the
                    plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Choh, that the “no cost order”
                    was not intended to give the impression that the application had some merits but
                    the court did not agree with the litigation representative this time or that she
                    could continue to file applications at no risk of costs orders being made
                    against the plaintiff.</p>
