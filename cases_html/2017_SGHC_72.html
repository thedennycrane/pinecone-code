CLAM was in the business of running a medical clinic called Orchard MD Clinic &amp; Surgery Singapore (“Orchard Clinic”) located at Ngee Ann City Tower B #08-03, Singapore. Orchard Clinic provided general medical services as well as aesthetic treatments. CLAM employed both Kelvin and Goh PK to work at the clinic. The services provided by them focused on aesthetic treatments relating to skincare.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The registered directors and equal shareholders of CLAM are Kelvin’s wife, Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline (“Jacqueline”) and the second defendant, Wong Hwee Leng (“Wong”), who is Goh PK’s wife. It was not disputed that Kelvin and Goh PK were <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>directors of CLAM at all material times.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Goh PK and Wong are the two directors and equal shareholders of the third defendant, GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd (“GPKPL”). GPKPL owned and operated GPK Clinic (Orchard) (“GPK Clinic”) in competition with CLAM and Orchard Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 CLAM’s claims in this action were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Goh PK breached his fiduciary duties and/or duty of good faith and fidelity by (i) failing to perform his work at Orchard Clinic since May 2014, (ii) diverting Orchard Clinic patients to GPK Clinic and (iii) poaching and/or soliciting employees away from CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Goh PK knowingly procured and/or induced CLAM’s employees to breach their contracts of employment by instructing them to direct patients and prospective patients of CLAM to GPKPL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Goh PK, Wong and GPKPL breached their duty of confidentiality to CLAM by improperly copying, using, reproducing, disclosing and/or disseminating CLAM’s information relating to its patients and its products.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Wong breached her fiduciary duties to CLAM in connection with the above matters.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Goh PK, Wong and GPKPL conspired with intent to injure CLAM by the above unlawful acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 21 October 2016, I gave my decision which, in summary, was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I found Goh PK and GPKPL liable for breach of confidentiality. I also found Goh PK and GPKPL liable for conspiracy to injure CLAM through Goh PK’s breach of confidentiality. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) All of CLAM’s other claims were dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I directed the parties to compute the amount of damages to be paid to CLAM based on certain parameters set out by me. The parties subsequently agreed on the computation of damages at $193,481.38.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) I ordered that information relating to patients who had not seen Goh PK at GPK Clinic as of the date of my decision be deleted from the defendants’ computers and/or other electronic devices, or destroyed if the information was in hardcopy. I also granted an injunction restraining the defendants from using any such information without prior authorization from CLAM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I subsequently heard the parties on costs after they had reached agreement on the computation of damages. On 20 February 2017, I ordered Goh PK and GPKPL to pay 40% of CLAM’s costs and disbursements. I further ordered that the party and party costs paid to CLAM were to be used to satisfy CLAM’s outstanding obligations for solicitor and client costs. Any balance thereafter was to be used to reimburse Kelvin for any costs that he had paid on behalf of CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 CLAM has appealed against the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The dismissal of its claims save for its claim relating to the poaching of its employees.

If a patient arrived at Orchard Clinic, the staff at Orchard Clinic would inform him and he would then either attend to them at Orchard Clinic or ask the staff of Orchard Clinic to send the patients to GPK Clinic. The circumstances in which Goh PK asked for patients to be sent to GPK Clinic and his reasons for doing so were in dispute. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On two occasions, Goh PK instructed the staff at Orchard Clinic to administer pre-procedure numbing cream on patients, before sending the patients over to GPK Clinic for treatment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) All fees collected from patients who saw Goh PK at GPK Clinic were kept by GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The number of patients seen by Goh PK at Orchard Clinic on his assigned days decreased over time.

</div> Whether the staff had acted on Kelvin’s and/or Jacqueline’s instructions remained in dispute. Goh PK found out about the practice and on 6 December 2014, he issued a memorandum to the staff of Orchard Clinic which stated that “[a]ny patients coming on my working days should not be told there is no doctor. I am around either by SMS, whatsapp or at GPK Clinic”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 CLAM argued that Goh PK could not work at GPK Clinic on his assigned days at Orchard Clinic. I disagreed. It was not disputed that Clause 10 permitted Goh PK to operate GPK Clinic in competition with Orchard Clinic. There was nothing to prevent Goh PK from working at GPK Clinic on his assigned days at Orchard Clinic. In addition, as Kelvin himself accepted,

</div> there was no reason to blame Goh PK for working at GPK Clinic after the staff at Orchard Clinic stopped fixing appointments on his assigned days and started fixing appointments for Goh PK’s patients on Kelvin’s assigned days instead. Further, as will be dealt with below, Goh PK was entitled to divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. Therefore, he could ask for patients to be sent to GPK Clinic although these patients could of course still choose to be treated at Orchard Clinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my judgment, what was required of Goh PK on his assigned days was that he carried out his tasks at Orchard Clinic and attended to patients at Orchard Clinic if they chose to be treated there.

It was clear that Kelvin and Goh PK had agreed to a parting of ways. The Settlement Agreement provided the mechanism for the sale of CLAM and MPC. It was common ground that Goh PK wanted the sale process to be completed within a few months whereas Kelvin wanted a period of five years; they compromised on three years.

</div> Clause 10 reflected their agreement that, in the meantime, Kelvin and Goh PK could compete with CLAM and MPC. It was not disputed that Clause 10 permitted Goh PK to set up GPK Clinic. The issue before me was whether Clause 10 also permitted Goh PK to divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Goh PK submitted that it was clear from the second sentence in Clause 10 (“the Second Sentence”) that he could divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. Nevertheless, Goh PK accepted that his ethical duties and responsibilities as a medical practitioner prohibited him from diverting to himself any patient who had consulted Kelvin exclusively.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Conversely, CLAM submitted that Clause 10 did not permit Goh PK to divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. First, CLAM submitted as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The commercial purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to have the parties disengage from their partnership by the end of 2016 or early 2017 at the latest and in the meantime, allow the parties to start new businesses whilst continuing the businesses of CLAM and MPC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Consistent with the commercial purpose of the Settlement Agreement, Clause 10 should be construed to mean that the parties will not, by mere reason of opening a competing business, be in breach of their duties to MPC or CLAM if “diversion” occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 CLAM explained that by “diversion”, it meant “inevitable” or “passive” diversion, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where patients of MPC or CLAM learnt of the existence of GPK Clinic and chose to go there.

</div> such cases did not amount to diversion. CLAM’s interpretation therefore meant that the Second Sentence merely clarified that the parties agreed not to make any claim for diversion in cases where there was in fact no diversion. However, if this was all that the Second Sentence meant, there was absolutely no reason or necessity for it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is trite that in construing a contract, there is a presumption against redundant words or surplusage: see Sir Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2015) at para 7.03. In my view, CLAM failed to rebut this presumption. The Settlement Agreement was drafted by Kelvin’s solicitors and reviewed by Goh PK’s solicitors. It was unlikely that they would have added the Second Sentence if it was devoid of meaning. Further, the evidence was consistent with the fact that the Second Sentence was intended to clarify that the parties could divert patients from CLAM and MPC:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Kelvin himself agreed that the word “diversion” in Clause 10 referred to the case where a doctor took steps to ask the patient to go to his new clinic and that the purpose of Clause 10 was to prevent any disputes over diversion in such cases.

</div> However, their explanation that Skintech products gave patients a wider choice only served to confirm that Skintech products <span class="font-italic">did</span> compete with those sold by Orchard Clinic.

</div>
</div> It must have been clear to Kelvin and Jacqueline that selling Skintech products to patients at Orchard Clinic was tantamount to diverting those patients away from Orchard Clinic, at least where the purchase of products was concerned. Nevertheless, they were of the view that Clause 10 permitted them to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the inclusion of the expression “for the avoidance of doubt” in the Second Sentence showed that the Second Sentence was intended to clarify the scope of the first sentence. Specifically, the Second Sentence was intended to remove any doubt about whether the liberty to compete included the liberty to divert patients from CLAM and MPC. The clear language used could only mean that Clause 10 permitted the parties to set up competing clinics and to also divert patients from CLAM and MPC. Otherwise, the Second Sentence would have no meaning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, CLAM argued that Clause 10 must be interpreted to prevent both Goh PK and Kelvin from diverting patients from CLAM because Clause 7 required them to continue with and fulfil their responsibilities to the 8-11 and Orchard Clinics pending the sale of CLAM and MPC. I disagreed. The interpretation that I gave to Clause 10 did not render Clause 7 meaningless. Clause 7 continued to apply where patients chose to continue to be treated at Orchard Clinic. In such cases, Goh PK was obliged to attend to these patients at Orchard Clinic on his assigned days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The interpretation that I gave Clause 10 was also consistent with the circumstances surrounding the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was the result of the mediation of the dispute in Suit 1023/2013 in which Goh PK had sued Kelvin for breach of the Confidentiality Contract (see [14]–[15] above). In his oral testimony, Kelvin confirmed that in Suit 1023/2013, Goh PK had alleged that he (Kelvin) was diverting Orchard Clinic patients by selling them Skintech products instead of Orchard Clinic products.

</div> Goh PK was seeking S$15m in liquidated damages as provided under the Confidentiality Contract. Against this factual matrix, it was clear that Clause 10 was intended to forestall future claims for diversion by permitting Kelvin and Goh PK not only to compete against CLAM and MPC but also to divert patients from CLAM and MPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Third, CLAM submitted that a reading of Clause 10 that permitted the parties to divert patients from CLAM and MPC might adversely affect the potential sale of the two companies. That may be true. However, in my view, the parties signed the Settlement Agreement with full knowledge and understanding of how Clause 10 was supposed to operate. As stated earlier, Kelvin’s solicitors drafted the Settlement Agreement which was reviewed by Goh PK’s solicitors. Both Kelvin and Jacqueline understood Clause 10 to permit the diversion of patients. In my judgment, Kelvin and Jacqueline must have understood that Clause 10 could affect the potential sale of the two companies. It was not for the court to re-write the agreement just because Kelvin and Jacqueline did not like how things turned out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Finally, counsel for CLAM referred to the fact that during the mediation that led to the Settlement Agreement, Goh PK did not give any indication that he intended to open his new clinic just two units away from Orchard Clinic.

This was done without informing Kelvin or Jacqueline.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Shortly after GPK Clinic commenced operations, Goh PK instructed the staff of GPK Clinic to send out greeting cards to patients of Orchard Clinic, using their names and addresses obtained from the Clinic Information. These greeting cards informed the recipients that Goh PK had opened GPK Clinic and welcomed them to see him at the clinic.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Goh PK also referred to and used the Clinic Information in the course of treating former Orchard Clinic patients who saw him at GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The elements that have to be satisfied for an action in breach of confidence are: (a) the information must possess the necessary quality of confidentiality; (b) the information must have been imparted (or received) in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and (c) there must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party from whom the information originated (see <span class="font-italic">Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and others </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 at [64]; <span class="font-italic">Invenpro (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1045 at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 There was no doubt that the Clinic Information was confidential in nature (see [41(c)] above). It was also clear that the Clinic Information belonged to CLAM. Goh PK was entitled to have access to the information by virtue of his position as a doctor employed by CLAM and as a <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>director of CLAM. However, he did not have, and Clause 10 did not give him, the right to copy the Clinic Information and use the same for purposes of GPK Clinic without permission, even if it was for purposes of being able to follow up on his patients’ treatments. Whenever a former patient of his from Orchard Clinic went to see him at GPK Clinic, Goh PK had to request Orchard Clinic to transfer the patient’s records to GPK Clinic after obtaining the patient’s consent to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the circumstances, Goh PK, who possessed the Clinic Information, owed a duty of confidence to CLAM and he breached this duty by using the Clinic Information for the purposes of GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As Goh PK was a director of GPKPL, Goh PK’s state of mind and knowledge was attributed to GPKPL: see <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd) </span>[2014] 3 SLR 329 at [47]–[48]. GPKPL was therefore also subject to a duty of confidence with respect to the Clinic Information. GPKPL breached this duty when the Clinic Information was used for the purposes of GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for Wong, she did not work at CLAM or Orchard Clinic. It was not disputed that she was informed of Goh PK’s actions after he had carried them out and that she did not object to any of these actions or take any steps to prevent them. I accepted Wong’s evidence that she had no knowledge of the business plans or operations of GPK Clinic.

</div> I was satisfied that she had not participated in Goh PK’s breach of confidentiality.

In my view, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the loss to CLAM was the loss of profits that Orchard Clinic could have continued to make from patients who would not have been diverted to GPK Clinic but for the unauthorized use of the Clinic Information; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the profits made by GPK Clinic from Orchard Clinic patients, who were diverted to GPK Clinic as a result of the unauthorized use of the Clinic Information, best represented the loss suffered by CLAM. After all, Orchard Clinic and GPK Clinic were competitors offering similar services and products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 There was no direct evidence to show whether any of the patients who were diverted to GPK Clinic, would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been diverted if Goh PK and GPKPL had not misused the Clinic Information. However, I agreed with CLAM that it did not need to prove its loss with complete certainty. Where it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage is not a reason to award no damages or only nominal damages: <span class="font-italic">MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd and another v Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2011] 1 SLR 150 at [57], citing <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623. In the present case, it was clear to me that some substantial loss had been incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, CLAM’s loss should be computed based on the profits that GPK Clinic made from patients who were diverted from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic during the period of six months from the date that GPK Clinic commenced operations, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 19 May 2014 to 19 November 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The evidence showed that Goh PK would have been able to divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic even without misusing the Clinic Information, except that it would have taken him a longer time to do so. What the Clinic Information did was to enable Goh PK to accelerate his diversion of patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. It provided Goh PK with an immediate source of contact details. This enabled Goh PK and GPK Clinic to contact patients more easily before their scheduled appointments at Orchard Clinic. In addition, although Goh PK could obtain patients’ records from Orchard Clinic with their consent, the fact that GPK Clinic had the patients’ records immediately available no doubt helped persuade Orchard Clinic patients to switch to GPK Clinic, especially in cases where they were still undecided on, or close to, their scheduled appointment days at Orchard Clinic. Unsurprisingly, Goh PK’s patients quite readily switched to GPK Clinic. After July 2014, very few appointments were made for Goh PK at Orchard Clinic and by August 2014, the staff at Orchard Clinic stopped scheduling appointments for Goh PK at Orchard Clinic altogether.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Given the circumstances of this case, in my judgment, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it was a fair and reasonable estimate that Goh PK would have been able to divert patients from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic within a period of six months (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 19 November 2014), without any unauthorized use of the Clinic Information; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was reasonable to treat all the patients who were diverted from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic within this period, as having been diverted as a result of Goh PK’s misuse of the Clinic Information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I rejected CLAM’s submission that its loss should be computed for the period from 19 May 2014 to 31 December 2016 (the deadline for the sale of CLAM and MPC under the Settlement Agreement). Using this period would have over-compensated CLAM. As concluded earlier, Goh PK would have been able to divert patients to GPK Clinic within six months, without misusing the Clinic Information. It followed that any loss suffered by CLAM beyond the six-month period would not be attributable to the breach of confidentiality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Computation of loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The remaining questions related to the parameters to be applied in computing the profits made by GPK Clinic from patients diverted from Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic during the six-month period from 19 May 2014 to 19 November 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I rejected the computation of loss made by CLAM’s expert witness, Mr John Temple-Cole (“Temple-Cole”), a partner of KordaMentha. Temple-Cole was instructed to compute the loss suffered by CLAM as a result of Goh PK wrongfully stopping work on his assigned days at Orchard Clinic for the period from 19 May 2014 to 31 December 2016 and working, instead, at a competing clinic (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>GPK Clinic).

</div> Temple-Cole was also instructed by CLAM to assume that CLAM would have derived revenue on Goh PK’s assigned days in the period subsequent to 19 May 2014 at a level similar to that derived in the period prior to 19 May 2014.

</div> As a result of the instructions given to him, Temple-Cole’s computation did not address the loss suffered as a result of the breach of confidentiality. It also did not take into account the effect of competition from GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendants’ expert, Mr Assan Masood (“Masood”), Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner of MGI Menon and Associates, computed the loss to CLAM based on the actual earnings (net of costs of sales and sales of non-CLAM products) by GPK Clinic on Goh PK’s assigned days. Non-CLAM products referred to products sold in GPK Clinic but not in Orchard Clinic.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Masood’s approach was therefore a better reflection of the loss suffered by CLAM as a result of the breach of confidentiality. However, I was of the view that no distinction should be drawn between CLAM products and non-CLAM products. It was reasonable to assume that if the patient had been treated at Orchard Clinic, some equivalent CLAM product would have been sold to the patient in place of the non-CLAM product that was sold at GPK Clinic. I was also of the view that profits earned from all Orchard Clinic patients treated at GPK Clinic ought to be included in the computation regardless of the day in the week that the patients saw Goh PK at GPK Clinic. If a patient had been diverted as a result of the breach of confidentiality, it did not matter whether they saw Goh PK at GPK Clinic on his Orchard Clinic assigned days or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I therefore directed the parties to compute the amount of profits made by GPK Clinic from Orchard Clinic patients, using Masood’s approach but based on the following parameters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An Orchard Clinic patient was someone who was already registered as a patient of Orchard Clinic when Goh PK copied the Clinic Information on 25 April 2014. Those who became patients of Orchard Clinic after 25 April 2014 would be excluded since the Clinic Information that Goh PK copied would not have included their information. If any such patient subsequently became a patient of GPK Clinic, that would not have been caused by the breach of confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Profits earned by GPK Clinic from Orchard Clinic patients were to include all products sold to the patients at GPK Clinic. No distinction was to be drawn between CLAM and non-CLAM products.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Profits earned from all Orchard Clinic patients were to be included regardless of the day in the week on which they were treated by Goh PK at GPK Clinic.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The parties agreed on the sum of $120,000 as the full amount of party and party costs excluding disbursements. The issues before me were (a) who was entitled to costs, and (b) whether the amount of $120,000 should be discounted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It was not disputed that costs should follow the event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the successful party should be awarded costs. However, the parties disputed who the successful party was. The defendants pointed out that CLAM had made several distinct claims and had succeed only on its claim based on breach of confidentiality. All its other claims were dismissed.  The defendants submitted that in substance, they were in effect the successful parties and as such were entitled to costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendants referred me to <span class="font-italic">Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 234 (“<span class="font-italic">Riduan</span>”). In that case, the appellant and his wife rented a property from the respondents. The respondents terminated the tenancy in 2001 but the appellant vacated the property only in 2003 after removing certain alterations. The respondents sued for double rent and damage to the property caused by the removal of the alterations. The respondents’ main claim for double rent was dismissed but they succeeded on their subsidiary claim for damage caused to the property. The Court of Appeal awarded the appellant 80% of the costs of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Riduan </span>was distinguishable as the respondents had failed in their main claim and had only succeeded on a subsidiary claim. In the present case, CLAM’s claim for breach of confidentiality was clearly one of the main claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I agreed with CLAM that it was the successful party in the suit since it had succeeded in its claim for damages for breach of confidentiality. As a general rule, the unsuccessful party is the one who has to write the cheque at the end of the day: <span class="font-italic">Day v Day</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 415 at [17]. I found no reason to depart from this general rule in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 However, CLAM was entitled to recover its costs from only Goh PK and GPKPL. It was not disputed that Wong was entitled to recover her costs from CLAM since CLAM’s claims against her were all dismissed. The parties agreed that instead of making a separate order for costs in favour of Wong, I should instead take that as a factor in deciding the costs payable by Goh PK and GPKPL to CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It was clear that the costs to be awarded to CLAM had to reflect the fact that it had succeeded only on its breach of confidentiality and the related conspiracy claims. CLAM submitted that it should be awarded 80% of the costs. The defendants submitted that as CLAM succeeded in only one out of five claims, it should be awarded 20% of the agreed costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The breach of confidentiality claim was one of two main claims in this case, the other being the claim for diversion of Orchard Clinic patients. In addition to the question of damages recoverable, the breach of confidentiality claim also had to deal with the deletion of records from GPK Clinic’s database. Taking into account the claims that were dismissed and the costs that CLAM had to pay to Wong, I awarded CLAM 40% of the costs in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendants also submitted that CLAM’s costs should not include the fees paid to CLAM’s expert, Temple-Cole, since I had rejected his computations. I disagreed with the defendants. The real question was whether the fees had been reasonably incurred for this action and in my view they had been. CLAM was therefore entitled to recover 40% of the fees paid to Temple-Cole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Counsel for CLAM sought an order that Kelvin be reimbursed for all costs and expenses incurred by him on behalf of CLAM in this action, including those incurred in respect of the claims that were dismissed. This action was commenced pursuant to the Resolution (see [19]). The Resolution had not provided for Kelvin to be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by him and the scope of the Resolution was not an issue in this trial. In reality, the disputes were between Kelvin and Jacqueline on the one hand and Goh PK and Wong on the other. It was at least unclear whether Goh PK and Wong would have agreed to the Resolution if Kelvin was to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses incurred by him since that would have meant agreeing to partially fund (albeit, indirectly through their interests in CLAM) this action against themselves. In the circumstances, I was of the view that it was not appropriate for me to make the order in favour of Kelvin, in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 However, the party and party costs to be paid to CLAM were to reimburse CLAM, at least partially, for its solicitor and client costs. Kelvin had paid at least some of the solicitor and client costs on behalf of CLAM. I therefore ordered that the party and party costs were to be used to satisfy CLAM’s outstanding obligations for solicitor and client costs. Any balance thereafter was to be used to reimburse Kelvin for any costs that he had paid on behalf of CLAM. Otherwise, CLAM would benefit from the costs recovered from Goh PK and GPKPL and in turn, half of this benefit would eventually find its way back to Goh PK (and Wong). It would have been wrong to allow that to happen.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Wee Yu Ping Nicole, Lim Wei Wen, Gordon, and Ngo Shuxiang, Nicholas (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Pereira George Barnabas and Chua Yung Zheng, Keith (Pereira &amp; Tan LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
