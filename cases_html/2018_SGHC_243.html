The Victim wanted to tell two of his friends what had happened, but CF counselled him not to. CF was advised by an officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”) that the case should be reported to the police, and CF conveyed this to B. CF added that later that afternoon, the Victim approached him and told him that he was nervous about talking to the police. The Victim also kept asking if the Accused had done what he did to the Victim to other kids.

He also expressed that he looked forward to leaving Singapore during summer break and felt “frustrated” at the number of times he had to recount the events.

I shall go through them in detail below at [114] to [122]. I summarise these reasons here. First, it was suggested that the Victim was afraid for having disturbed B when B was watching the “live” telecast of the rugby World Cup final that night. Second, it was suggested that the Victim had made up these allegations as a form of attention-seeking behaviour because of his emotional distress at his parents undergoing a divorce. Third, it was suggested that the Victim had been shaken by the Halloween atmosphere that night, and could thus have imagined the sexual assault. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Defence further suggested that the Victim could have imagined acts of a sexual nature occurring because he had been sexualised at school, for example, by being exposed to discussions about oral sex in the social media group chats among students of his school.

The first of these was the Prosecution’s application to admit Annex C of P54 as rebuttal evidence. Annex C consisted of the obscene images (67 obscene photographs in total) retrieved from the Accused’s laptop depicting persons, mostly males, engaged in sexual acts. The Prosecution based this application on two grounds: (a) to disprove the Accused’s evidence of good character, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was only sexually interested in women, pursuant to s 56 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed); and (b) to rebut the specific argument of the Accused that he was not sexually interested in males.

It was also submitted that Annex C satisfied s 14 of the Evidence Act since it would go towards showing the “existence of any state of mind”, the state of mind in the present case being the Accused having homosexual tendencies.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 After hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the Prosecution’s application to adduce Annex C as rebuttal evidence. I opined that character was put in issue, and Annex C might be potentially relevant as a specific rebuttal in relation to the Accused’s assertions of being a family man with strong moral or ethical values. But in any event, I dismissed the application on the basis that the prejudicial effect of its admission might be higher than the probative value. Upon further consideration of the parties’ submissions, I will now elaborate on and clarify my decision to dismiss the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The statutory basis for the admission of rebuttal evidence is s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). Section 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">t</span>) gives the Prosecution the right to call a person as a witness or recall a witness for the purpose of rebuttal, and is intended to allow the calling of rebuttal evidence based on the long-standing practice in the courts (Jennifer Marie &amp; Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir, <span class="font-italic">The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 12.060 and 12.061). The admission of rebuttal evidence is a matter for the court’s discretion, and the threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence for both civil and criminal proceedings has been set out conclusively in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 467 at [51] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [the calling of rebuttal evidence] will be allowed only in the case of a matter arising <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">improviso</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> one which the plaintiff could not reasonably have foreseen. In other words where the plaintiff has been misled or taken by surprise or in answer to evidence of the defendant in support of an issue the proof of which lay upon the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I agreed with the Defence that the threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence was not met in the present case. Firstly, the present case did not involve a matter arising <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">improviso</span>. The Prosecution was in possession of Annex C all along, ever since the forensic examination report was produced on 13 May 2016. Annex C was served on the Accused on 26 September 2017 before the trial commenced on 3 October 2017. On 6 October 2017, Neo Poh Eng testified on the stand that the Prosecution would not be adducing Annex C of the forensic examination report.

</div> No formal application to admit Annex C was made at the close of the Prosecution’s case. Nevertheless, the Prosecution subsequently decided to refer to Annex C during the cross-examination of the Accused. The eventual attempt to adduce Annex C was made in order to rebut the Accused’s claim that he was not sexually interested in males, but this was an issue which was brought up by the Prosecution itself during its cross-examination of the Accused. The Accused did not bring up the issues regarding his family values or his sexuality at all, and his testimony in relation to these issues only arose upon being questioned by the Prosecution during his cross-examination.

</div> In these circumstances, it could not be argued that the matters of the Accused’s sexuality and family values arose <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">improviso</span>, and had taken the Prosecution by surprise. Secondly, the present case did not involve an issue in respect of which the burden of proof lay upon the Accused. This was far from the situation in <span class="font-italic">Osman bin Ali v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [1971–1973] SLR(R) 503, where rebuttal evidence was allowed in relation to the defence of diminished responsibility, for which the burden of proof was on the defendant. In the present case, it was not the Defence that sought to show in the Defence case that the Accused had no interest in males and was a family man with strong moral or ethical values. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The present situation is distinguishable from a case where a defendant seeks to prove his good character; in the latter case, it is likely that the Prosecution would be allowed to adduce rebuttal evidence in reply because the situation is one arising <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">improviso</span>, provided that the Prosecution did not foresee the Defence raising the issue. In the present case, the failure to meet the threshold for allowing rebuttal evidence alone is sufficient to dispose of the Prosecution’s application to adduce Annex C. Nevertheless, for completeness, I go on to address the other issues brought up by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Prosecution argued that the Accused had testified as to his good disposition or reputation and it could therefore adduce evidence as to his bad character pursuant to s 56 of the Evidence Act. The prohibition of questions as to his bad disposition and character under s 122(4) of the Evidence Act (setting out what is commonly known as the character shield) would therefore not apply. The context however was that the Prosecution had produced a document titled “Selection of … Family Pictures” depicting photographs of the Accused’s family and his annotated descriptions of them being “[a] solid family unit with a very happy, loving, 14-year marriage” with “3 wonderful children loved by their parents and raised with strong family ethics/Asian values” during the cross-examination of the Accused (later admitted into evidence and marked as P55). Upon being questioned by the Prosecution, the Accused stated that he had produced the document and sent it to IO Ng while investigations into this case were ongoing.

</div>
</div>
</div> Based on these answers to questions regarding his sexuality and P55 posed by the Prosecution, the Prosecution argued that the Accused had lowered his character shield. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is unnecessary for me to make any comment as to whether being heterosexual is evidence of a person’s good character or disposition; I will analyse the parties’ submissions in the framework of s 56 because the parties had presented their submissions as such. In any event, the Accused’s evidence of having “strong ethical values” was arguably an assertion of good disposition.  I opined that character was put in issue as a result. However, upon further deliberation and analysis, I have come to the position that the Accused’s character shield was not lowered. Although P55 was produced by the Accused and P55 was intended to show that he was a person of good disposition, the Accused did not tender this document to court nor seek to have it admitted. I would not have had sight of this document and would not have known of the Accused’s claim to having strong ethical values had the Prosecution not tendered P55 to court. Similarly, the Accused’s testimony as to his sexuality only arose upon being cross-examined by the Prosecution. None of this testimony was offered by the Accused of his own accord. In such a situation, where the Prosecution has elicited this evidence through cross-examination, it may be said to have forced the Accused’s hand, and thus it could not be said that the Accused had lowered his character shield. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This position is in line with a purposive reading of s 56(1) of the Evidence Act, which sets out the exhaustive scenarios where the Prosecution can call evidence to establish that the accused is a person of bad disposition or reputation. Section 56(1) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In any criminal proceedings, the accused may – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  personally or by his advocate ask questions of any witness with a view to establishing directly or by implication that he is generally or in a particular respect a person of good disposition or reputation;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) himself give evidence tending to establish directly or by implication that he is generally or in a particular respect such a person; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) call a witness to give any such evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Sections 56(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 56(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) envision active steps being taken by the accused to adduce evidence as to his good character or disposition. Section 56(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) uses the phrase “himself give evidence”, which may encompass giving evidence during cross-examination, but it would be consistent with the other sections to interpret s 56(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as also requiring an active step initiated by the accused to testify as to his good disposition or reputation. This must be distinguished from a situation where the Accused is simply answering questions from the Prosecution under cross-examination; such a situation is not the same as one where the accused volunteers evidence as to his good disposition or reputation of his own accord. Moreover, a restrictive interpretation of s 56(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is also warranted because s 56 is an exception to the prohibition of questions as to an accused’s bad disposition and character under s 122(4) of the Evidence Act. It is only where the three scenarios set out in s 56(1) apply that an accused’s character shield is lifted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As far as I am aware, there is no Singapore authority on this particular issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether evidence given by an accused during cross-examination as to his alleged good disposition or reputation in response to questions posed by the Prosecution can be considered a lowering of his character shield. The English case of <span class="font-italic">R v Henry Beecham</span> [1921] 3 KB 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Henry Beecham</span>”) is helpful in this regard. In that case, the defendant in cross-examination was repeatedly asked and pressed to answer the question whether he bought the motor-car in question because it was capable of being driven at high speed and he replied at last that it “did not appeal to [him] for that reason, because [he did] not care for driving at a high rate of speed [himself]”. The Prosecution latched onto this answer and treated it as evidence given by the defendant of his good character as a driver, and sought to question him about his prior driving convictions. On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that with regard to the cross-examination, they were “bound to say that [they could not] approve of the manner in which the defendant was led by counsel for the Prosecution to give an answer which in [their] view virtually amounted to putting his character as a driver in issue. If the method by which this defendant was induced to bring his character into question were to be held legitimate, the result would be that practically any defendant might be forced into the same position”. Therefore, the court held that the defendant’s answer did not amount to him giving evidence of his good character within the meaning of s 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898 (c 36) (UK),

</div>
</div> a section similar to s 56 of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Similarly, in the present case, the Accused was induced to testify as to his strong ethical values and sexual orientation by the Prosecution’s questions and production of P55. Admittedly, it was the Accused who had created P55 with all its attendant annotations in the first place; however, he did not seek to adduce it in court and nothing was mentioned of P55 until the Prosecution adduced it in court. I agree with the court’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Henry Beecham</span> that under such circumstances, it could not be said that the Accused had given evidence tending to establish his good disposition or reputation within the meaning of s 56 of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the circumstances, the Prosecution cannot then rely on their second ground, which was that Annex C ought to be admissible for the purpose of rebutting the specific argument of the Accused that he was not sexually interested in males, to circumvent the prohibition on adducing evidence as to the bad disposition of the Accused after characterising the issue as a matter of character evidence pursuant to s 56 of the Evidence Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In any case, even if the Accused’s character shield was lowered and Annex C was admissible as evidence of the Accused’s bad disposition or reputation, or to rebut the specific argument that the Accused was not sexually interested in males, I found that the court should exclude Annex C in the exercise of its judicial discretion because it had greater prejudicial effect than probative value. The existence of this exclusionary discretion of the court was confirmed in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”), where the Court of Appeal (at [51] and [53]) approved of the holding in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Guat Neo Phyllis</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Phyllis Tan</span>”) that the court has a discretion to exclude any evidence that had more prejudicial effect than probative value. <span class="font-italic">Phyllis Tan</span> was in turn based on the first limb set out by Lord Diplock (with whom the other judges agreed) in <span class="font-italic">R v Sang </span>[1980] 1 AC 402 (“<span class="font-italic">Sang</span>”) at 437, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a trial judge in a criminal trial always has a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if in his opinion its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The exclusionary discretion was applied to the admission of accused persons’ statements in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>, and it is also equally applicable in the area of character evidence, as in the present case. In fact, the area of character evidence was where the concept of excluding evidence based on its probative value being less than its prejudicial effect first took root, as canvassed by Lord Diplock in <span class="font-italic">Sang</span> at 433. In the present case, the probative value of Annex C was low. Even if the contents of Annex C might be suggestive of the Accused’s homosexual tendencies, they did not necessarily indicate that he must have been sexually attracted to pre-pubescent males. The prejudicial effect outweighed the probative value since the photographs might nevertheless colour the court’s view as to the Accused’s sexual orientation and suggest that he was therefore more predisposed to commit the offences he was charged with. For the above reasons, I therefore refused the Prosecution’s application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defence’s Kadar application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71  I shall now address the application made by the Defence. After the defence was called on 1 Feb 2018, Counsel for the Accused applied for a copy of the Victim’s statement recorded by the Police on 2 November 2015, pursuant to <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> and s 147 of the Evidence Act. There were two grounds cited for this application: (a) the alleged material discrepancies and contradictions between the Victim’s testimony in court and the Summary of Facts produced by IO Ng, and between IO Ng’s testimony in court and the Victim’s testimony; and (b) the subsequent amendment of the first charge to remove the words “over his shorts” from the charge as originally framed.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Prosecution resisted the application, on the basis that the grounds for disclosing witness’ statements under s 259 of the CPC were not applicable and that there had been no breach of the disclosure obligations set out in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 After hearing submissions from both parties, I dismissed the Accused’s application for the disclosure of the Victim’s statement recorded on 2 November 2015. It is apposite to emphasise that what was at issue was a disclosure application. The CPC does not prescribe a statutory obligation to disclose unused material (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [102]). Section 259(1) of the CPC, as cited by the Prosecution, and s 147 of the Evidence Act, as cited by the Defence, govern the admissibility of witnesses’ statements, which is a separate issue from disclosure. The Prosecution’s duty of disclosure is purely rooted in general principles of common law (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [110]) and the court’s power to enforce this duty arises from the inherent jurisdiction of the court to prevent injustice or an abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [112]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The court in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> has set out the materials that the Prosecution <span class="font-italic">must</span> disclose to the Defence, but these do not include material which is neutral or adverse to the accused. It only includes material that tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [113]). In relation to the phrase “material … that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant”, it refers to material that is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> credible and relevant based on an objective test (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [114]). There is a presumption that the Prosecution has complied with the disclosure obligation and this presumption is only displaced if the court has sufficient reason to doubt that the Prosecution has complied with the disclosure obligation (<span class="font-italic">Lee Siew Boon Winston v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1184 (“<span class="font-italic">Winston Lee</span>”) at [184]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the Accused failed to raise a sufficient reason for the court to doubt that the Prosecution had complied with its disclosure obligation. The first ground raised concerned the alleged discrepancies between the Summary of Facts and the Victim’s testimony in court, as well as between IO Ng’s testimony and the Victim’s testimony. From the outset, the Prosecution rightly pointed out that the Summary of Facts was not prepared or produced by the Victim, but by IO Ng. The Victim had no knowledge as to how it was produced and no control over its contents. IO Ng testified on the stand that he had prepared the Summary of Facts on 2 November 2015 and had included information from both the Victim and the Victim’s father (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not solely from the Victim).

</div> Any inconsistency in the Summary of Facts could not be directly attributed to the Victim. The Summary of Facts was produced for investigative use, and its purpose was to provide a quick brief to any officer assigned to the case and to Dr Cai for him to have some brief background facts to assess the Victim’s fitness to testify in court. For the purpose of this assessment, Dr Cai’s own report was a brief one-page summary of the interview. It was notable in this regard that Dr Cai had also not relied on the Summary of Facts, but had obtained facts required for his assessment directly from the Victim.

</div> In addition, the Defence did not cross-examine IO Ng as to whether he had accurately prepared the Summary of Facts and as to which information in the Summary of Facts came from the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Highlighting the inconsistencies between the Victim’s testimony in court and the Summary of Facts, which was not prepared by him and not entirely based on information provided by him, is not sufficient to bring the Victim’s statement recorded on 2 November 2015 into the two categories set out in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [113]. In <span class="font-italic">Winston Lee</span>, the High Court held that the “shifts” in the victim’s evidence from “touching, to pressing down to squeezing are not material nor do they alter the main thrust of the complaint’s version of events” and “the use of the word chest and breast are not sufficiently material to raise reasonable grounds for belief that the complainant had told differing versions about the incidents to the police” (at [190]). Thus, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Winston Lee</span> found that there were no reasonable grounds for the belief that the Prosecution had not complied with its <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligation. Similarly, the inconsistencies in the present case were not sufficiently material to raise reasonable grounds for belief that the Victim must have told widely differing versions about the incidents to the police. The allegations of fellatio and outrage of modesty were stated in both accounts to have taken place on the night of 31 October 2015, and the differences in the timing and the attributions of a particular act to a particular re-entry were insufficient to raise reasonable grounds for the belief that the Victim had told a materially different version in his statement recorded on 2 November 2015. This was even more so given that the Summary of Facts was not produced by the Victim and the Victim had no control over how it was produced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The present case was different from <span class="font-italic">AOF v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”), where the Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution should have disclosed the victim’s police statements in the light of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the significant discrepancies in the frequency of the alleged rapes (at [152]). In <span class="font-italic">AOF</span>, the victim’s testimony regarding the frequency of alleged rapes over a few years was internally inconsistent (at [130] and [144]). In the present case, on the other hand, the Victim was consistent in his oral testimony regarding his account of exactly what had happened, and all the accounts pointed to fellatio and outrage of modesty having taken place on the night of 31 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In relation to IO Then’s testimony that the Victim told him that the Accused went up to the upper bunk bed of E’s room (instead of R’s room), I did not place weight on this discrepancy because IO Then testified in re-examination that he had conducted the same experiment on both the bunk beds in E and R’s rooms, and all these experiments were based on the boys’ accounts.

In any event, any discrepancy as to which bed was involved during the second sleepover did not go so far as to show that the Victim’s statement recorded on 2 November 2015 would be exculpatory material that was likely to be admissible and objectively <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the Accused, or material likely to be inadmissible but yet provide a real chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Prosecution did not specifically address the second ground of the application submitted by the Defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the subsequent removal of the words “over his shorts” from the first charge as it was originally phrased. Nevertheless, I found that this amendment to the first charge was insufficient to show that the Victim’s statement recorded on 2 November 2015 would fulfil either of the two <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> disclosure thresholds. A similar argument was also raised in <span class="font-italic">Winston Lee</span>, where the accused submitted that the change in the content of the charge, from one that stated that the accused “had slid his hand into [the victim’s] left brassiere cup to touch her left breast while pressing down” to one that stated “inserted his hand into the complainant’s left brassiere cup and touched her left breast and nipple” (at [152(b)]), was one ground for the disclosure of the victim’s police statements. The court held that the change was not material and did not alter the main thrust of the complainant’s version of events (at [190]). Similarly, in the present case, the main thrust of the Victim’s version of events that the Accused had touched his penis remained the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 On a related note, the Defence suggested in its closing submissions that the first charge was not made out because the words “over his shorts” were removed from the original charge.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I rejected this contention. The present case was unlike <span class="font-italic">XP v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686, where the court found that the complainant had failed altogether to mention a crucial detail which was stated in the charge that was proceeded with at trial. In contrast, the first charge in the present case was amended before the trial commenced. The Prosecution retains the discretion to proceed with any amended charge at trial. The Victim’s evidence was consistent with the particulars in the amended first charge. This was not an instance of the Victim failing to mention any detail in the proceeded charge at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In all the circumstances, I was not satisfied that the Defence had raised sufficient reason to doubt that the Prosecution had complied with the disclosure obligation set out in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>. I therefore dismissed the Defence’s application for disclosure of the Victim’s statement recorded on 2 November 2015. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision (I): evaluation of the Prosecution’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The present case centred on my evaluation of the quality of the evidence, and whether there was adequate proof of the charges beyond reasonable doubt. Essentially, it was the word of the Victim against that of the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Defence was a complete denial of the Victim’s allegations. Much of the trial involved attempts to show that the Victim had purportedly given differing accounts of the incident to different witnesses at different times, and that he was not a credible witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The corroborative evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I begin by examining two related facets – whether there was corroboration of the Victim’s allegations, and whether his testimony was “unusually convincing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Our courts have rejected the strict approach to corroboration laid down in <span class="font-italic">The King v Baskerville</span> [1916] 2 KB 658, in favour of a more liberal approach as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Mardai </span>[1950] MLJ 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Mardai</span>”), at 33. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [173] reiterated the endorsement of the more liberal approach, quoting <span class="font-italic">Mardai</span> with approval:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would be sufficient … if that corroboration consisted only of a subsequent complaint by complainant herself provided that the statement implicated the Appellant and was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Whether a complainant’s previous statement can be corroborative evidence is also codified in s 159 of the Evidence Act, which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">159.</span> In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 However, even if the complainant’s statement can be corroboration, it might be of less additional evidential value because it is not independent corroboration. The court in <span class="font-italic">Khoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 expressed a caution along these lines (at [49]): although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is not corroboration by independent evidence because it is self-serving. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> concluded that “whilst the failure to meet the strict standards of <span class="font-italic">Baskerville</span> corroboration does not rule out the relevance of evidence, this deficiency is likely to adversely affect the weight of the evidence which the court concerned may accord to it” (at [177]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Applying the law to the present case, I found that the Victim’s contemporaneous complaint to B as soon as B arrived at the Accused’s residence was corroborative evidence. It satisfied s 159 of the Evidence Act: the Victim’s complaint to B was a statement made in ordinary conversation relating to the same sexual assaults about the time when the sexual assaults took place. There was no delay between the offences and the statement – it was made at the earliest opportunity that the Victim had. However, keeping in mind that the statement was not wholly independent, I placed reduced weight on it. Coupled with my assessment of the Victim’s demeanour and his credibility, as I shall explain below, the corroborative statement strongly buttressed the veracity of the Victim’s account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 There was further corroboration in the form of the observations of the Victim and his reactions immediately after B had picked him up from the Accused’s residence. Reasonable explanations were also given by IO Then and B as to why further potentially corroborative DNA and fingerprint evidence were not obtained in the course of investigations. The presence or absence of DNA evidence in the Accused’s own residence was neither here nor there, and as B had explained, he had told the police that the Victim’s pyjamas had been washed, unaware that they had actually been disposed of. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Victim’s testimony and demeanour</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Where there is a lack of corroborative evidence, the testimony of a victim of a sexual assault must be “unusually convincing”. In <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636, the Court of Appeal explained at [28]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">PP v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”) at [38], this court held that to be “unusually convincing”, the witness’s testimony must be “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”. Elaborating further at [39], the court held that a complainant’s testimony would be usually convincing if the testimony, “when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”. As this court held in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [115], the relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing are <span class="font-italic">his or her demeanour, as well as the internal and external consistencies found in </span><span class="font-italic">the witness’ testimony</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There was no independent corroboration in the present case. Yet even if little or no weight was placed on the Victim’s corroborative statement to B, I found that the Victim’s testimony was unusually convincing. The Victim was a credible witness who gave evidence in a frank and forthright manner. His evidence withstood the test of rigorous cross-examination and was consistent in all material particulars. From my observation of his demeanour, he was candid and showed no tendency whatsoever towards embellishment, exaggeration or pretense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 When confronted with the inconsistent versions in the Summary of Facts (see [46]–[47] above), the Victim was firm in pointing out which parts were not accurate, and maintained his account of events on the stand.

</div> Under fairly intense cross-examination, the Victim remained firm and measured in his testimony. His account of the three offences was unshaken under cross-examination. He was able to point out exactly what was erroneous in the Summary of Facts and correct them. One such instance from his cross-examination is illustrated below:

He was also unfazed when the Defence attempted to attack his evidence by pointing out that the report produced by Dr Cai stated the timing of the first offence to be around 11.00pm instead of 11.15pm. He testified that when he told Dr Cai 11.00pm, he was referring to the time he checked his watch, which was about 10 minutes before the first offence. If Dr Cai meant that the offence took place at 11.00pm, he maintained that it was “incorrect”.

</div>
</div> This showed that the Victim had told Dr Cai that he had checked his watch at around 11.05pm, so there was no discrepancy between what he had told Dr Cai and his account on the stand. Instead, Dr Cai’s clerking sheet corroborated the Victim’s testimony. I would also add that Dr Cai was not cross-examined by the Defence on this aspect of his report and this appeared to be an attempt at splitting hairs over minor variations in the description of timings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The inconsistencies that the Defence pointed out at [46]–[49] and [50(b)]–[50(c)] above related primarily to the discrepancies between the Victim’s testimony and the reports by other Prosecution witnesses. I begin by observing that there would almost inevitably be discrepancies when the Victim’s accounts and the reports of other persons who had obtained information from him are compared and examined. He had after all been asked to provide detailed information on numerous different occasions to different persons, and at times, he had to repeat his story as well. There would invariably be differences in the details each time the incident was described. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Moreover, the accounts of the other Prosecution witnesses such as Dr Cai and CF were second-hand information, and could have been shaped by their own perception and understanding as to what had happened. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Chean</span><span class="font-italic"> Siong Guat v Public Prosecutor</span> [1969] 2 MLJ 63 explained, “[s]ometimes what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times”. Those witnesses might also differ in how they chose to record or digest the Victim’s account as narrated to them. For example, in the report by Dr Cai, he stated that the incident took place at about 11.00pm, although he recorded in his clerking sheet that the Victim had checked his watch at “around 11.05pm”. As for CF, his evidence was that he spoke first with B, before speaking separately with the Victim. CF’s account of the events would therefore have been shaped and influenced by these two accounts, and thus might appear to contain discrepancies. Witnesses such as Dr Cai or CF were not undertaking the role of investigation officers, and their records understandably might not be absolutely precise or comprehensive. The Summary of Facts, although produced by IO Ng, served the purpose of a preliminary document to aid Dr Cai in conducting his assessment, and might not be pinpoint accurate as to the exact timings and the exact sequences of events. As IO Ng described, the Summary of Facts was prepared for the purpose of allowing anyone who was assigned to the case to have a “quick run” of the case and contained “raw information”.

I have earlier explained why I dismissed the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> application made by the Defence as I did not think there was a proper basis for the application; the alleged inconsistencies were not sufficiently material to raise reasonable grounds for belief that the Victim had told widely differing versions about the incidents to the police. For example, with regard to the Victim’s testimony that he saw the railing of the upper bunk bed to be at the upper chest level of the Accused (see [50(a)] above), it could be due to a parallax error in his perception given that he was lying down when looking at the Accused. Moreover, the railing could be more accurately described as being at the stomach level of someone similar to the Accused’s height in the Reach Experiment instead of at the belly button level as described by the Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In another instance, it was highlighted that JR, the Victim’s teacher, had mentioned in her conditioned statement that the Victim was awakened upon being touched by someone,

</div> This, however, ignored the fact that JR’s account was based on what she had heard from C, and was multiple hearsay – the Victim had related his account to B, who in turn conveyed it to C, who in turn conveyed it to JR.

</div> Although the light from outside was streaming in, no one from outside was likely to have been able to see what was taking place in E’s bedroom, as the Accused’s back was facing the door. As I shall explain later (at [161] below), E was unlikely to have been aware of what was going on either because he was fast asleep. Even if E had woken up, from his sleeping position on the lower bunk, he would not immediately have realised what the Accused was doing. It might be said that it was improbable for the Accused to have stepped on the lower bunk if E was sleeping on the outer edge of the bunk; the Accused would conceivably have stepped on E. As I explain below at [133] to [134], however, I did not accept the claim that E was sleeping on the outer edge of the lower bunk to be true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Second, I did not accept that it was unbelievable that the Accused could have pulled down the Victim’s shorts without lifting his hip, or that the Accused could have dragged the Victim’s body by pulling him by the kneecaps. Neither of these actions was inherently incredible given that the Victim was a young boy who was hardly overweight or hefty. It was certainly not impossible for the Accused to have carried them out, as even his own doctor, Dr Yegappan, testified (see below at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Victim’s behaviour was consistent with that of a victim of sexual assault</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Defence alleged that the Victim was not believable because he did not do as he was taught in school to deal with “bad touch” encounters, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to shout and push the Accused away. The Victim testified convincingly that he was afraid that the Accused would realise he was awake, and “could, like, hurt [him] because [the Accused] would be scared that [he] would tell someone else”.

</div> The Victim also testified that he had tried to move closer to the wall when the Accused committed the first offence to avoid the Accused, but to no avail. It is important to keep in mind the context in which the offences occurred in determining whether the behaviour of a victim was odd. In the present case, the Victim was a nine-year-old boy spending the night in his good friend’s bedroom as a guest for a sleepover when his friend’s father, someone whom he liked and trusted, sexually assaulted him. It was highly probable that when confronted with such circumstances, a boy his age would not remember, much less put into practice, what he had been taught to do. He would not know how to react, and it would not be reasonable to expect him to be quick-witted enough to resist, let alone to confront and shout or push his friend’s father away. I found that there was nothing unusual about the Victim’s feeble and futile attempts to avoid the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I also found that it was not odd or surprising at all for the Victim to have gone to the Accused’s bedroom so that he could call his father to bring him home.

The only way he could think of to get away from the Accused’s residence was to contact B, and to do that, the Victim needed to inform E’s parents and ask to use their phone. The Victim sought help from B immediately after the sexual assaults, using the only obvious means available to him at that time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It was significant that the Victim insisted on calling B even when AW told him it was too late at night.

However, in my view, this was a complete mischaracterisation of B’s evidence – reading the entire context of B’s testimony, B had been commenting about the Victim’s mood changes, and his tendency not to open up readily in talking to B but to only do so “a little bit more with his mum”.

More importantly, no scientific or expert evidence was adduced at the hearing to support the Accused’s theories.

This was a particularly compelling and cogent consideration, especially when viewed alongside the Victim’s spontaneous and near-contemporaneous complaint. The Victim enjoyed going to the Accused’s residence and playing with the Accused (see [4] and [5] above), which was why the Victim had looked forward to the sleepover on 31 October 2015. B also corroborated that the Victim liked the Accused. B testified that after returning home from his first sleepover at the Accused’s residence, the Victim was “very excited from that sleepover because he said he had so much fun”.

</div> All this suggested that there was no reason for the Victim to bear any negative views towards the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Accused offered three possible motives why the Victim would have falsely implicated him, which I have summarised above at [51]. The law, however, is not that the Prosecution must bear the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the appellant. Rather, the Prosecution would only bear that burden if an accused is able to adduce sufficient evidence of such a motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case (<span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 374 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng</span>”) at [33]). It is not enough for the accused to merely allege that the victim has a motive to falsely implicate him. If it were otherwise, then, as Yong CJ pointed out, “the Prosecution would have the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the accused in literally every case, thereby practically instilling a lack of such motive as a constituent element of every offence”: <span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng</span> at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I found the motives suggested by the Defence to be baseless conjectures bordering on the absurd. The Defence adduced no evidence to support any of the motives suggested. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The first reason offered by the Defence was that the Victim was scared for having disturbed his father, B, when B was watching the “live” telecast of the rugby World Cup final. The suggestion was that B was angry with the Victim at having to miss the broadcast because he had to pick up the Victim from the Accused’s house, which explained why the Victim looked terrified in B’s car. There was thus a possibility that the Victim fabricated the sexual allegations against the Accused to escape B’s wrath.

The Victim could have been frightened by the Accused’s zombie pirate costume, or suffered a “sugar high” from eating too much candy, and either of these, or both, induced him into imagining the sexual assault. But the evidence simply did not support this notion. The Victim gave evidence that he thought Halloween was a “fun, exciting game” because he “[got] to collect candy” and “hang out with [his] friends”.

</div> He also indicated that he wished to keep some candy to trade with his siblings. I found absolutely no merit in the Accused’s suggestions that the Victim could have had a vividly lurid nightmare about being sexually abused, on account of being traumatized by the frenetic Halloween atmosphere or by the sight of the Accused in a zombie pirate costume with fake blood on his face. Indeed, the Accused’s case was so weak on this score that he had to resort to making annotations on photographs taken that Halloween night to suggest that children were “terrified” by the Halloween environment. As I note below at [156], the annotations were self-serving, and it could not be said that the children in the photograph looked positively terrified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It bears recalling that the Defence’s theories were founded on the notion that the Victim had been sexualised at school, and could thus have imagined the sexual assault. This too was totally baseless. There was no evidence that the Victim was aware of or even privy to the online chats on oral sex in the mass chat groups that were allegedly formed by certain groups of students at his school. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I found that the Victim had absolutely no reason nor any incentive to falsely incriminate the Accused.

The crux of the accounts given by B and the rest of the Prosecution witnesses was materially the same. The differences in details, such as B being unable to remember that the Victim had told him that he had disposed of the pyjamas, and B testifying that the Victim had pointed a finger at the Accused outside his residence when asked to repeat what he had told B, were not consequential. They were explicable on account of B’s state of shock and confusion at the material time after the Victim revealed what had happened. It was hardly surprising that B might not have been able to remember all the details accurately because he was struggling that night to come to terms with the situation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether it was physically possible for the Accused to have carried out the acts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Prosecution called Wilson to give evidence that it was not physically impossible for the Accused to have carried out the alleged acts of fellatio and touching the Victim’s penis.

He claimed that his spinal condition had been worsening since then. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s assertions were very much exaggerated. I observed that he was able to remain seated for fairly lengthy durations throughout the course of his trial, including up to nearly two hours at a stretch, despite his claims that he could not sit in one position for durations exceeding 15 or 20 minutes on account of his spinal condition. By his own admission, the Accused did not take any painkillers when testifying in court and on the material night. He also testified that he did not wear his brace that night as it did not “look right” with his Halloween costume.

It may have required some effort on his part, but that did not mean that he could not have done the acts as alleged.

The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s evasiveness, selective recall of events and his propensity for engaging in speculation and exaggeration all pointed to a manufactured defence borne out of his consciousness of guilt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Accused’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The Accused’s testimony was often rambling and off-tangent.

His facetious explanation of what he understood “running around” to mean in vernacular American usage was plainly inappropriate.

For the avoidance of doubt, as Annex C was not admitted in evidence, I placed no reliance on the obscene images themselves in assessing the credibility of the Accused and I did not have regard to them to ascertain whether he had any homosexual proclivities.

Evidence was led by the Prosecution that just before his termination from MAP, a reformat of the hard disk of his laptop had been done such that if there were any images whether obscene or otherwise existing in his laptop, the reformat would have removed them and rendered them unrecoverable. And in any event, there was no reason for obscene images to be found in his laptop prior to his leaving MAP to begin with, as access to such online material in the course of work was prohibited and he had not received any exemption to do so – see [139] above. The only logical inference therefore was that the obscene images found their way into his laptop after he was terminated from his employment at MAP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The Accused called a consultant in Computer Forensics, Frances Chu, as his witness.

I found that there was a complete reformatting of the Accused’s laptop which wiped out all pre-existing files, rendering them unrecoverable. This fortified my finding of the Accused’s lack of credibility in maintaining that he did not actively download any obscene images and that residual “pop-ups” must have remained within his laptop. Even if such “pop-ups” appeared in the course of accessing adult websites for research, it bears reiterating that he had flatly denied browsing homosexual pornography for work purposes to begin with, and then shifted his evidence further under cross-examination and re-examination.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence of Alessandro Forlin and Professor Peter Lim  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Prior to raising his belated objection to the admissibility of the obscene images, the Accused had called Alessandro Forlin and Professor Peter Lim to support his claim that those images were detected in his laptop because: (a) he had to access adult websites and sex forums to better market P; and (b) that homosexuals suffering from premature ejaculation should be the target demographic for marketing P as such persons would access such Internet sites to look for relevant information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I mention the evidence of Alessandro Forlin and Professor Peter Lim purely for the sake of completeness.

They were far from objective or reliable, venturing to put forward little more than speculative personal opinions. I was not persuaded that there was any sound basis for the entire thesis put forth by the Accused <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, of having to access adult websites at work for research and marketing purposes, and specifically targeting the homosexual/gay market segment. The proposition was dubious and fanciful and I need say no more about it or about the evidence of the two witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The annotations on the exhibits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The Accused tendered Exhibit D17 as proof of rectification of damage to E’s bunk bed.

A close inspection of the original exhibit however revealed differences in handwriting, which were not obvious at first blush. It was only upon the Prosecution’s probing that the Accused admitted that he himself had written in details of the repair works onto the receipt.

To be fair, this was his attempt to put across his position and his own subjective interpretations, but these must also have been meant to colour the court’s assessment of the evidence. For instance, he gratuitously added his annotation of a child (not the Victim) supposedly appearing “terrified” in a photograph taken on the Halloween night in question (exhibit D2 pg 6). This could only have been intended to bolster his suggestion that the Victim was similarly affected by the Halloween atmosphere. I should add that it was not at all obvious to me that the child in question appeared “terrified”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In another instance, the Accused sought to place before the court Instagram posts and related comments from various social media accounts (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> Snapchat) to show the comments posted by account holders and their “friends” or “followers” purporting to have “homosexual” inclinations.

E’s recollection of only very specific incidents on the night in question was highly suspect. He had said that it was an uneventful night, yet he could distinctly remember looking at the StarHub Cable box and noting that it was 10.32pm when he asked his father to play Mad Libs with him.

</div> Conveniently, E claimed to have fallen asleep by the time the Victim returned to retrieve his bags. He claimed that he thought the Victim was only leaving the bedroom to go to the bathroom but he did not bother to check whether the Victim needed any help, despite recalling that the Victim was repeatedly tossing and turning fitfully in bed “like he was having a seizure” and with such great intensity that it caused E to fear that the upper bunk bed would collapse on him. If so, it was unbelievable that E did nothing more than stand on his bunk to look at the Victim and then simply go back to bed again. In addition, he claimed that his mother had opened the bedroom door to check on them, but he did not convey anything to her about his observations of his friend purportedly thrashing violently on the bed “like he was having a seizure” or his fear that the upper bunk bed might collapse on him as a result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Not surprisingly, E struggled to explain under cross-examination why he was able to recall only certain specific details with remarkable clarity. He was very selective in his purported recollection of what he claimed to have done, observed and remembered.

In this connection, E, to his credit, was honest enough to admit that his parents had convened a discussion the very next night (1 November 2015) pertaining to what had allegedly happened the night before.

This was wholly consistent with the Victim’s evidence that the offences occurred at about 11.15pm.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The text messages sent by AW to B at 11:59pm and 12:21am showed that from the very outset, AW had sought to protect her husband without question. She made no effort to verify the grave accusations made against him. In the second text, she volunteered that she and the Accused were together “the whole time in our room with our door closed”.  The Accused echoed this in his 12:29am text which claimed that he and AW were “absolutely together in our room since E and (the Victim) went to sleep upstairs”. This, however, contradicted the Accused’s evidence of the events of the night of 31 October 2015. In his evidence-in-chief, the Accused said that after he had settled E and the Victim for the night, he had gone to get his two other sons and R’s two friends (J and N) to go to bed.  He then went up to the third floor at 11.10pm with R and his two friends and AW. He claimed that R, J and N took turns using the bathroom and playing basketball on the third floor; that after he sent them to bed, he eventually left for the second floor to talk to S in his room, leaving his wife on the third floor cleaning up the mess from the Halloween party; and that he only met up with AW thereafter on the second floor after he had left S’s room.

</div> J and N were not called to corroborate this account, which was designed to show that the third floor was still abuzz with activity even at that hour, giving the Accused no opportunity to commit the offences at 11.15pm. He had however completely overlooked the fact that this account contradicted the text messages sent to B stating that he and AW were together “<span class="font-italic">the whole time</span>” after E and the Victim had gone to bed. Clearly, when a patchwork of lies and afterthoughts is cobbled together, some cracks will inevitably show on closer examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Attacks on the Victim’s credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Finally, I address how the Accused sought to turn defence into attack by impugning the Victim’s credibility in various ways. He labelled the Victim a liar, maintaining his case theory that the Victim had no qualms fabricating serious allegations of sexual assault. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The following instances demonstrate the extremes that the Accused was prepared to go to in painting a picture of a hyper-sexualised nine-year-old boy who had falsely accused him of sexual assault by penetration and aggravated outrage of modesty due to his overactive imagination, his “familiarity with sexual matters”, his school and/or Halloween environment and his attention-seeking behaviour. He attempted to link the Victim to social media posts commenting on “homosexual” activity (see [52] and [157] above). He put up his son R to mention the “rape tag” game and oral sex chats in school, and then suggested that the Victim would have known of or even participated in them (see [163] above). In all these aspects, there was no evidence at all to suggest that the Victim was aware of these activities or had participated in them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The Accused further insisted that the Victim’s use of the word lick” to describe how he was sexually assaulted betrayed his “familiarity with sexual matters”. Even a popular song (“Party Rock Anthem”) which contained explicit lyrics became the focus of the Accused’s submissions. The song lyrics were annexed as “Exhibit B” to the Accused’s Closing Submissions, together with “Urban Dictionary” definitions (presumably sourced from the Internet) of “relevant words” from the song.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I saw nothing untoward in the Victim’s use of the word “lick”. It was certainly over-imaginative of the Accused to read a sexual connotation into it. The Victim had in fact alluded to a perfectly simple and innocent literal meaning when he described the Accused’s act of fellating him as follows: “like he was going to eat something” (see [13] above).

</div>
</div> It will suffice to note that no formal application was made to adduce evidence of this set of song lyrics during the trial and the Victim was never given any opportunity to refer to these lyrics in “Exhibit B” while he was testifying. Moreover, there could conceivably be different versions of lyrics for popular music, including versions without explicit lyrics that are intended for general airplay. There was no basis to suggest that the Victim would have known about oral sex through his familiarity with this set of song lyrics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Next, I address the Defence’s argument that the Victim was familiar with sexual matters because he used the phrase “blow me” in his evidence. This argument was founded on the Notes of Evidence of 4 October 2017 at page 42, line 12 – where the Victim is recorded as having said: “So he didn’t have to flip me over when he blow me. I was already sideways” (“the Transcribed Notes”). This point was specifically raised in a subsequent discussion in chambers mid-way through the trial when the Prosecution highlighted the likelihood of an unfortunate but inadvertent error in this segment of the Transcribed Notes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 I recall that I had pointed out during our discussion in chambers that I did not record the Victim saying the word “blow” in my own notes. Thus, this was a point which I had honestly not expected the Accused to take further. Regrettably, it was ultimately resurrected by the Accused, who suggested in his closing submissions that “it is difficult to imagine what other word [the Victim] could have used in that sentence”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Closing Submissions of the Accused, p 19 at footnote 118.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In any case, to lay the matter to rest, I have verified from the audio recording of the Victim’s evidence on 4 October 2017 that the actual word the Victim used was “pulled” and not “blow”. The relevant sentence thus reads: “So he didn’t have to flip me over when he pulled me. I was already sideways”. This is perfectly grammatical and entirely coherent and consistent with the context of the Victim’s evidence, where he spoke of how the Accused dragged him away from the part of the bed which was closer to the wall. It was not “difficult to imagine” the word “pulled” (or some other word for that matter, such as “turned” or “moved” etc.) being used. To my mind, this was a most telling illustration of a Defence that was desperately grasping at straws, straining to make every conceivable effort to discredit and disparage the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Finally, at [123] and [124] of the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the Defence argued that a procedural defect in not cautioning the Victim to speak the truth (as he did not take an oath) “[struck] at the very heart of the Prosecution’s case”. This is not supported by s 6 of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211, 2001 Rev Ed) which gives the judge the prerogative whether to caution a witness or not. More significantly, the argument that this was a fatal omission affecting the Prosecution’s case is met by s 8(a) of the Oaths and Declarations Act which states:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings and evidence not invalidated by omission of oath, etc.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">8.</span>  No omission to take an oath, make an affirmation or administer a caution, and no irregularity in the form or manner in which an oath is taken, an affirmation is made or a caution is administered, shall —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) invalidate any proceedings or render inadmissible any evidence in or in respect of which the omission or irregularity took place…</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I concluded that for all his strenuous endeavours to discredit the Victim and paint his version as a complete fabrication, the Accused had only revealed the glaring inadequacies of his own case.  At the end of the day, the Defence remained a bare denial and the Accused did not raise any reasonable doubt. No plausible reason was advanced as to why the Victim would have falsely complained that the Accused had fondled and fellated him at the sleepover on 31 Oct 2015 when he had thoroughly enjoyed previous sleepovers and the Halloween party and activities that night.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, I found that the Victim’s testimony was unusually convincing and amply supported by objective evidence. His account was described simply, honestly, and assuredly. There was a palpable ring of truth resonating in his testimony which was internally and externally consistent in material areas. I was satisfied that the three charges were established beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convicted the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Submissions on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The Prosecution drew guidance from the Court of Appeal decisions in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng”</span>) and<span class="font-italic"> Pram Nair</span> <span class="font-italic">v</span> <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”).

Reference was also made to my decision in <span class="font-italic">GBR v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">GBR</span>”) which introduced a sentencing framework for outrage of modesty of persons under 14 years of age.

The first step is to identify the sentencing band the offence falls into by considering the presence of any “offence-specific” factors. These factors relate to the manner and mode by which the offence was committed and the harm caused to the victim. Once the appropriate sentencing band has been identified, the court should derive an “indicative starting point” by determining precisely where within the range of sentences the present case falls. The second step is to identify “offender-specific” aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the circumstances personal to the offender and balance these so as to calibrate the appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The sentencing bands for digital penetration, an offence punishable under s 376 of the Penal Code, were laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> as follows (at [159]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  Band 1: seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Band 2: ten to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  Band 3: 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The Court of Appeal explained further at [160] of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> that in formulating these sentencing bands, it was conscious that where the offence of sexual penetration discloses any of the two statutory aggravating factors in s 376(4) of the Penal Code, there is a prescribed minimum sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, and that these cases should fall within Band 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 A similar “sentencing bands” framework scaled appropriately for aggravated outrage of modesty offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code was laid down in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Having regard to these frameworks, the Prosecution submitted that a global sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sexual assault by penetration (“SAP”) charges should fall within the higher end of Band 2 (based on the framework in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>). The indicative starting point should be 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, per charge;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The outrage of modesty (“OM”) charge should fall within the middle to the higher end of Band 2 (based on the framework in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span>). The indicative starting point should be two years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An uplift from 16 to 17 years is necessary on account of the offender-specific aggravating factor (namely, evident lack of remorse). The appropriate sentence should therefore be 17 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Having regard to the totality principle, as well as the fact that the three offences took place within a short span of time, the global sentence should be calibrated to 15 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The Prosecution highlighted the following offence-specific aggravating factors: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The Accused had abused his position and breached the trust placed in him by the Victim and his parents;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The Accused had sexually violated a young and vulnerable victim without his consent;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Careful planning and premeditation was involved;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Severe harm was caused to the Victim.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In mitigation, the Accused pointed to personal hardship and the physical hardship and suffering he would face in prison as a result of his back injury. However, these were not exceptional circumstances justifying a more lenient sentence. I noted that the Accused was a first offender but this was a neutral consideration in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In addition, it was submitted that the Accused ought to be deemed to have committed the offences in the second and third (SAP) charges in one transaction, and hence should only face one sentence for these two charges. With respect, I was not persuaded by the Defence submission that only one offence was in effect committed in respect of the second and third charges. The offences therein could not properly be characterised as involving repetition of several acts of the same character in a single transaction. There were separate and distinct instances involved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Determining the appropriate sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I accepted that the relevant offence-specific aggravating factors in the present case were the Accused’s abuse of his position and breach of trust, sexual violation of a young and vulnerable victim, planning and premeditation, and the severe harm caused to the Victim. These cumulative factors brought the SAP charges within the middle to higher end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework introduced by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The Accused’s actions were a flagrant abuse of the trust reposed in him by the Victim and his parents.  There was a significant amount of deliberation and premeditation in his conduct, which was aimed at winning the Victim’s trust and taking steps to facilitate his commission of the offences. There was also palpable psychological harm caused to the Victim, who remained fearful of the Accused and requested to be allowed to testify through a video-link facility to avoid being in the presence of the Accused and having to face him within the courtroom. The adverse impact the offences have had on the Victim was further illustrated by the pointed observations of his parents and his school counsellor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 As for the offender-specific mitigating factors, I was unable to discern any of note. The abhorrent nature of the offences on a young and vulnerable victim called for the sentence to be retributive, but more importantly, to have an appropriate deterrent effect, to serve both the ends of general and specific deterrence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 With reference to the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [150], the Prosecution submitted that SAP (fellatio) should be considered more serious than SAP (digital-vaginal), but less serious than rape. I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that the sentencing benchmark set out in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> which concerns digital-vaginal penetration would be equally applicable to an offence of fellatio. Its application to the present case would not cause the Accused to be prejudiced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution showed that the courts would typically impose a custodial sentence of between 10 to 12 years’ imprisonment with the mandatory minimum 12 strokes of the cane,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>even for offenders who plead guilty. Pertinent (unreported) precedents include <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Selvaraju Jayaselvam</span> (Criminal Case No 14 of 2009), <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chan Kok Weng</span> (Criminal Case No 24 of 2009), and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Peterson </span><span class="font-italic">Ebah Jr</span> (District Arrest Case No 32797 of 2011 and ors).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Of particular note was <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span> [2018] SGCA 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span>”). In this case, the offender, a 61-year-old male, was convicted after trial for fellating a 12-year-old boy who was of low IQ, without his consent, in a male toilet within Tampines Eco Park. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The offender</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>had no antecedents. He <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">eight years’ imprisonment. No caning was imposed due to his age. On the Prosecution’s appeal, the Court of Appeal enhanced the sentence to 10 years and six months’ imprisonment, with an additional six months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span> was a useful comparator in my view because it involved a) a claim-trial situation, b) a young and vulnerable victim and c) psychological harm to the victim as a result of the offender’s acts. Crucially, the offence-specific factors such as abuse of trust and premeditation, which featured prominently in the present case, were not present in that case. Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentence for SAP in the present case should exceed that in <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span>, and the aggregate sentence should correspondingly be significantly higher given that three charges were involved as compared to only one. In my view, the indicative starting point for the SAP charges should be 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane per charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In addressing the offender-specific aggravating factors, the primary consideration was the Accused’s lack of remorse. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>explained that an offender’s evident lack of remorse can be discerned from the fact that he has made scandalous allegations in respect of the victim. In the present case, the Accused had similarly displayed a marked lack of remorse. First, he claimed trial to the offences: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [64(c)]. He did not spare the Victim the ordeal of testifying. The Victim had to tell his story yet again and relive the painful details of the incident while testifying in court. In <span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 68, the court recognised at [46] that victims of sexual offences are made to relive the trauma of their sexual assault when they have to attend court to give evidence and be cross-examined on it. I should add that there is no “double-counting” as this consideration is distinct from the assessment of the harm caused to the Victim, which was accounted for among the offence-specific aggravating factors arising from the commission of the offences themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Second, the Accused’s lack of remorse was apparent from the bold and extravagant manner in which he chose to conduct his defence. He engaged in victim-shaming tactics to portray the Victim as a hyper-sexualised boy who had fabricated or imagined the sexual acts due to his alleged “familiarity with sexual matters”. He made numerous spurious allegations in a bid to discredit the Victim. This was clearly aggravating and I took this into account in arriving at the appropriate indicative starting sentence. In <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span>, the Court of Appeal had similarly noted how lack of remorse was evident from the manner in which the offender chose to conduct his defence at trial (at [9]). I bore in mind the aggregate sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment that was imposed in <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong’s</span> case, while noting that in both instances, the offenders were convicted after trial, and had not shown any evident remorse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I turn next to consider the appropriate sentence for the OM charge. In <span class="font-italic">GBR</span>, I proposed a sentencing framework for offences involving aggravated OM under section 354(2) of the Penal Code. Three sentencing bands were suggested, and the present facts would bring this case within the middle to higher end of Band 2, as there was skin-to-skin contact involving the Victim’s private parts. Taking into account the offence-specific factors discussed above, as well as the sentence imposed in <span class="font-italic">GBR</span>, I agreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting point should be two years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998, Sundaresh Menon CJ laid down the applicable principles pertaining to the totality principle in sentencing where a judge is obliged to impose consecutive sentences. After giving due consideration to the totality principle, I saw no reason to make further adjustments to the indicative starting points. They were fair and proportionate to the totality of the Accused’s criminal behaviour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Having regard to the sentencing precedents as well as the relevant fact-specific sentencing considerations, I considered it appropriate to impose a sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum of 12 strokes of the cane for each of the SAP charges under s 376(1)(b) punishable under s 376(4)(b) of the Penal Code, and a sentence of two years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the OM charge. At least two of the sentences would have to be ordered to run consecutively. In my view, an aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was sufficient to send a strong deterrent message.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Bail pending sentence and appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Upon the Accused’s conviction on 6 August 2018, the Prosecution applied for the Accused’s bail to be revoked. Counsel for the Accused objected strenuously to the application for bail revocation, but I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused was a real and substantial flight risk. His wife and children had already relocated back to the United States and they evidently had no intention to return to Singapore. He had no other kith or kin here. He was not employed, did not own any property and had no roots or relevant remaining connections in Singapore. Hence there was no reason for him to feel compelled to stay on to face his sentence. I therefore allowed the Prosecution’s application to revoke his bail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 After the Accused was sentenced on 31 August 2018, an application for bail pending appeal was made. There was no change to the relevant considerations which had been surfaced earlier. As the risk of the Accused absconding remained real and substantial, I refused bail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Gag order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 A gag order prohibiting publication or disclosure of the name of the Accused and the Victim, and any information that might lead to disclosure of the Victim’s identity, was made at the commencement of the trial. After securing the Accused’s conviction, the Prosecution sought to lift the gag order on publication of the Accused’s name so that his identity would become disclosable. I declined to do so. I was of the view that if his identity were to be made public, it would almost certainly make it much easier to ascertain the identity of the Victim, since the Accused’s immediate family including his sons who were the Victim’s schoolmates could in turn be readily identified. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 For the above reasons, I was satisfied that the three charges were proven beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted and sentenced the Accused accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I ordered the global sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane to be backdated to 6 August 2018. The Accused was denied bail pending appeal and is presently serving his sentence. The gag order prohibiting disclosure of the identity of the Victim and any information that might lead to his identification remains in force.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Christina Koh, Raja Mohan and Nicholas Lai (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br/>Selva K Naidu (Liberty Law Practice LLP) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">ANNEX A – Abbreviations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">AW  – The Accused’s wife</div><div class="txt-body text-left">B  – The Victim’s father</div><div class="txt-body text-left">BE  – E’s friend (second sleepover)</div><div class="txt-body text-left">C  – The Victim’s mother</div><div class="txt-body text-left">CF  – The Victim’s school counsellor</div><div class="txt-body text-left">E  – The Accused’s youngest son</div><div class="txt-body text-left">J  – R’s friend (third sleepover)</div><div class="txt-body text-left">JR  – The Victim’s fourth grade teacher</div><div class="txt-body text-left">MAP  – The Accused’s former employer</div><div class="txt-body text-left">N  – R’s friend (third sleepover)</div><div class="txt-body text-left">P  – Sexual performance enhancement drug for premature ejaculation</div><div class="txt-body text-left">R  – The Accused’s second son</div><div class="txt-body text-left">RF  – E’s friend (second sleepover)</div><div class="txt-body text-left">S  – The Accused’s eldest son</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
