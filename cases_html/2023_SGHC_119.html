This involved the respondent’s failure to take reasonable steps to inform the Victim, Neo Wei Siang, Gerald, of the damage to his vehicle and provide the Victim with his particulars, an offence under s 84(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 84(7) of the RTA and punishable under s 131(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA (the “TIC Charge”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This was the Prosecution’s appeal against the sentence of a fine of $4,000 for the Careless Driving Offence. The Prosecution did not appeal against the sentence for the Drink Driving Offence or the disqualification period for the Careless Driving Offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Specifically, this appeal raised the question of the appropriate sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA and the application of this framework to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the conclusion of the hearing on 24 February 2023, I allowed the appeal. In brief, my reasons are two-fold. First, the sentencing framework laid down in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 4 SLR 587 (“<span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span>”) provides useful guidance for the offence here concerning s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA. Second, the DJ erred in the application of the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework to the present case as the present case fell within Band 2 rather than Band 1. After considering the relevant sentencing factors, I took the view that a custodial sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment was warranted and the sentence of a fine of $4,000 was manifestly inadequate. I set out my reasons below for allowing the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The following charge in DAC 910427-2022 in relation to the Careless Driving Offence is the subject of this appeal:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, [respondent] are charged that you, 5 February 2022, at about 10.16 p.m, along Blk 220 Petir Road Open space carpark, Lot 286, Singapore, did drive motorcar, SDG 8466C, on the road without due care and attention to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout when reversing into a parallel parking lot and collided onto the right side of one motorcar, SLV 9002C which was parked ahead of your vehicle, at parking lot number 286 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1) (a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, have been convicted on the following earlier occasion(s):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) On 02 September 1998 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH) under Section 63(4) Road Traffic Act Chapter 276 vide R98079246LD; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) On 25 August 2004 in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Speeding (41-50KMPH road) under Section 63(4) Road Traffic Act Chapter 276 vide R04028048ND. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">which conviction have not been set aside, and you shall thereby be liable for punishable under Section 65(5)(c) read with Section 65(5)(b) and Section 65(6)(i) and Section 67A(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The respondent admitted without qualification to the material facts of this case as set out in the Statement of Facts. On the night of 5 February 2022, the respondent drank four small glasses of “Chivas” at his shop located at Upper Bukit Timah Road. After the drinking session at his shop, the respondent decided to drive himself and his wife back to their home located at Block 220 Petir Road.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At the carpark near their home, the respondent failed to keep a proper lookout as he was reversing into a parallel parking lot. His car collided into the right side of a car belonging to the Victim, which was parked ahead. Both cars were damaged, with scratches and dents on the rear right side of the Victim’s car. The cost of repairs to the Victim’s car was $2,400. The respondent had made full restitution to the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, and the traffic volume was light.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 After the collision, the respondent and his wife left for home. About two hours later, on 6 February 2022 at about 12.11am, the Victim discovered the damage to both his car and the respondent’s car and called the police. The police tracked down the respondent at his home. The respondent failed a breathalyser test and was arrested. He was escorted to the Traffic Police Headquarters. At about 3.27am, a Breath Analysing Device test conducted on the respondent revealed that there was 85μg of alcohol in every 100ml of the respondent’s breath. This exceeded the prescribed limit of 35μg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">The proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution’s submissions below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 At the plead guilty mention, the Prosecution sought a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and three years’ disqualification for the Careless Driving Offence on the basis that the case fell within Band 2 of the framework laid down by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span>.

In this regard, the DJ considered the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the harm caused (GD at [48]–[52]). In particular, she noted the respondent’s status as a repeat offender “by virtue of his 1998 and 2004 speeding convictions and his level of alcohol [which] was at the second highest band of <span class="font-italic">Rafael</span>”.

</div> as the extent of his irresponsible driving within the carpark was swiping the rear right portion of the Victim’s motorcar while trying to parallel park his car. The DJ further noted that the respondent’s previous convictions were relevant but dated. The DJ found that the present case involved a lower level of seriousness falling within Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework, with a starting point of a fine of $6,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the second step, the DJ calibrated the sentence based on the offender-specific factors. The DJ considered that there was potential harm, albeit not of a significant degree, in view of the time of the offence, the light volume of traffic, the respondent’s manner of driving and his low speed as he parallel-parked his car. Further, the extent of property damage consisted of scratches and dents and thus fell within the higher level of the low harm category.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Overall, the DJ found the following factors aggravating.

</div> The respondent’s alcohol level was high. In addition, after consuming alcohol, the respondent drove home from Upper Bukit Timah Road to Petir Road with his wife as a passenger. She also considered the TIC charge as an aggravating factor. The DJ observed that the respondent, having failed to provide his particulars after the accident, would have escaped responsibility for his charges if the Victim had not discovered the damage early.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In terms of the mitigating factors, the DJ considered that the respondent’s plea of guilt at the first court mention was a sign of his genuine remorse and, therefore, a mitigating factor. Furthermore, the DJ considered that the respondent had provided restitution to the Victim for the cost of repairs amounting to $2,400 before the first court mention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Considering these factors and the totality principle, the DJ calibrated the sentence downwards to a fine of $4,000. The DJ also imposed a disqualification period of 30 months, which was in line with the range of two to three years’ disqualification for a Band 1 offence delineated in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The grounds of appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Prosecution submitted that the fine of $4,000 for the Careless Driving Offence was manifestly inadequate.

</div> the range for the <span class="font-italic">fines</span> is not identical. This point was acknowledged by the Prosecution in its oral submissions. Apart from this minor difference, I agreed that the punishment provisions between the two offences are largely similar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Furthermore, as the Prosecution pointed out in its oral reply at the hearing, the respondent’s attempt to emphasise the differences in seriousness of the offences between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> cannot stand. While <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> does technically concern the offence of dangerous driving and the present case concerns the offence of careless driving, as the respondent had sought to emphasise in both its written and oral submissions, it must be borne in mind that <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> concerned a first-time offender. Here, the respondent was a repeat offender and was thus liable to enhanced punishment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The respondent relied on the speech of then-Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mrs Josephine Teo, in the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill for the point that Parliament intended to distinguish between the sentencing regimes for dangerous and careless driving. In particular, it was noted that Parliament considered dangerous driving to be more serious than careless driving (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (8 July 2019) vol 94 (Mrs Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For better clarity and consistency, we propose to consolidate irresponsible driving offences under the RTA.

With respect, this argument was without merit. The Prosecution did not go so far as to submit that the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework applies directly to the present offence. Indeed, it readily acknowledged the truism that the offences are, by their nature, different; one deals with dangerous driving, and the other, careless driving.

</div> This provision applies because the respondent had been convicted twice for the specified offences of speeding in 1998 and 2004. Thus, the respondent is liable for up to three times the amount of punishment for which he would otherwise have been liable under s 67A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the purposes of this appeal, I did not find it necessary to invoke s 67A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA, as it is contingent on the requirement that such a higher sentence be found to be “expedient for the protection of the public or with the view to the prevention of further commission of any such offence”. The Prosecution did not explain why this would be the case here in its written or oral submissions. As the respondent highlighted at the hearing, there is the further requirement (<span class="font-italic">viz</span> in committing the prior offence, he must have driven a motor vehicle on a road at a speed which exceeded the speed limit by 40km/h) to be fulfilled under s 67A(2) as the respondent is a “person who has been convicted of an offence under section 63(4)” given his past speeding convictions. While the Prosecution highlighted in reply that this requirement was in fact met as the Record of Proceedings showed that the appellant had driven at over 40km/h past the speed limit in relation to these past convictions, it nonetheless clarified its position that it was not seeking for any uplift in sentence on the basis of s 67A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). It had only relied on this provision for the more limited proposition that the existence of these provisions reflects the significance Parliament places on an offender’s previous convictions (and reoffending). Parliament’s concern similarly applies to the punishment provision in the present case under s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which prescribes enhanced penalties for repeat offenders. In my view, to the extent that the Prosecution relied on s 67A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) purely for the limited point that the Careless Driving Offence in the present case cannot be less serious than that in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span>,

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In determining the correct band in the present case, I found it instructive to consider the non-exhaustive list of offence-specific factors laid out by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(a) Serious potential harm:</span> Apart from actual harm, it has long been accepted that regard should also be had to the potential harm that can result from the act of dangerous or reckless driving (see <span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span> ([26] supra) at [47]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1099 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Thiam </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span>”) at [41]). The level of potential harm would be (<span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan Sheng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 5 SLR 410 at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… assessed against facts which would include … the condition of the road, the volume of traffic or number of pedestrians actually on or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road at the relevant time, the speed and manner of driving, visibility at the relevant time, the type of vehicle, and any particular vulnerabilities (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a truck or car colliding into a motorcycle or pedestrian).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As is evident, these relate to the circumstances of driving that could increase the danger posed to road users (see <span class="font-italic">Edwin </span><span class="font-italic">Suse</span> ([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [28]). Where an assessment of these facts reveal that the potential harm occasioned to road users would have been serious, this would be an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(b) Serious property damage:</span> The extent of property damage caused is a relevant sentencing factor. As a general rule, the amount of any loss or damage may serve as a proxy indicator of harm.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(c) High alcohol level found in the accused person’s blood or breath:</span> A high level of alcohol that substantially exceeds the prescribed limit would be an aggravating factor. As noted by the court in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span> at [37], an offender’s alcohol level is an indicator of his inability or unfitness to drive due to his alcohol intake, and heavier punishment should therefore be imposed on drivers with higher alcohol levels. This determination of whether an offender’s alcohol level is high can be made with reference to the sentencing framework for an offence under s 67, recently set out in <span class="font-italic">Rafael Voltaire </span><span class="font-italic">Alzate v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 3 SLR 993 (“<span class="font-italic">Rafael Voltaire </span><span class="font-italic">Alzate</span>”) at [31], which is calibrated in accordance with the alcohol levels found in an offender’s blood or breath. In the context of sentencing under s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), this will be a factor of particular importance: see [33]–[34] above and [37] below. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(d) An offender’s reason or motivation for driving:</span> The court in <span class="font-italic">Edwin </span><span class="font-italic">Suse</span> held that an offender’s reason or motivation for driving could be an aggravating (or conceivably, in some circumstances, even a mitigating) factor in respect of an offence of drink driving. The court further considered that the gravity of an offender’s conduct would be increased if he had, at that time, been driving a passenger for hire or reward (at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(e) Increased culpability:</span> In <span class="font-italic">Koh Thiam </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> at [41], the court considered that factors <span class="font-italic">increasing</span> an accused person’s culpability for an offence of dangerous driving would include a <span class="font-italic">particularly dangerous manner</span> of driving. Examples of such aggravating factors include excessive speeding or deliberate dangerous driving, such as in “hell riding” cases (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Thiam </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The offender’s conduct following the offence or attempt to evade arrest: Conduct that is “belligerent or violent” upon arrest would constitute an aggravating factor: <span class="font-italic">Edwin </span><span class="font-italic">Suse</span> at [32]. Likewise, the failure to stop in an attempt to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension should also weigh against an offender: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 240 at [33].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In applying these factors, Menon CJ emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [37] that the level of alcohol found in an offender’s blood or breath will be a critical factor in determining the appropriate sentencing band:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It bears reiterating that the fact of drink driving has been legislatively highlighted as a significant factor in sentencing (as explained at [33]–[34] above). <span class="font-italic">This is reflected in the extent of the increase in the potential sentence that an offender may face due to the application of the serious offender provision under s 64(2</span><span class="font-italic">C)(c) of the RTA</span>. As such, the level of alcohol found in an offender’s blood or breath would be a key factor in determining the sentencing band in which a case is situated.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the high level of alcohol found in the respondent’s breath is critical in determining the sentencing band for the offence here. There has been a similar “increase in the potential sentence that an offender may face due to the application of the serious offender provision” which Menon CJ pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [37], this provision being s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA. This is supported by Menon CJ’s finding (<span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [32]) that “Parliament’s intention in introducing the <span class="font-italic">serious offender</span> provisions (<span class="font-italic">including</span> s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)) was to punish offenders for the aggravated conduct of driving recklessly or dangerously <span class="font-italic">whilst under the influence of drink</span>” [emphasis added]. There is no reason why this proposition does not also apply to the Careless Driving Offence here which also engages the serious offender provision under s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA for the aggravated conduct of driving carelessly <span class="font-italic">whilst under the influence of drink</span> in the present case. Indeed, this was implicit in Menon CJ’s use of the word “including” and, in any event, nothing in Menon CJ’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> precludes this finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Based on the foregoing, the present case would fall within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework once it is considered that the respondent had a high alcohol level of 85µg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. As the DJ found, this alcohol level fell within the higher end of Band 3, which is the second-highest band of the <span class="font-italic">Rafael</span> framework. Given the legislative emphasis on the factor of drink driving, where an offender’s blood or breath alcohol level is in the highest or second-highest band of the framework in <span class="font-italic">Rafael</span>, the present case was likely to fall at least within Band 2: <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [42].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In attempting to downplay the centrality of the offender’s high alcohol level, the respondent pointed to the following statement of Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [42]:

</div>
</div> It was fortuitous that no harm to any persons was caused during this journey. I note also that the respondent’s wife was in the car, placing her in a position where potential harm to her could have been caused. These were not adequately considered by the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Second, there was actual property damage or harm caused. The risk of harm to property had materialised, resulting in property damage to the Victim to the tune of $2,400. I was cognisant that the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework lays out the consideration of <span class="font-italic">potential</span> harm and <span class="font-italic">actual</span> harm as distinct considerations. In this regard, I raised a concern to the Prosecution at the hearing that it appeared that there may be some overlap between the two considerations in the present case.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>As the Prosecution rightly submitted, any such overlap would be restricted. This is because on one hand, consideration of actual harm focuses on the moment of a collision. On the other hand, potential harm looks at the wider circumstances before and after a collision. Regarding the potential harm, this would entail consideration of the circumstances arising in the duration leading up to the accident, as the respondent had driven for some distance from Upper Bukit Timah to Petir Road before the accident occurred. Pertinent considerations on the potential harm included the fact that he was carrying a passenger, and that he was driving in a residential zone (with pedestrians and vehicles nearby) near the end of his journey before the accident occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Accordingly, the present case would fall within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework. I found that a starting point of one month’s imprisonment would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 2: The applicable offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The primary offender-specific aggravating factor in the present case was the respondent’s twin status as a repeat offender and a serious offender. With respect, the DJ erred in glossing over this, and in finding that “[a]lthough the accused is considered a <span class="font-italic">repeat offender</span> by virtue of his 1998 and 2004 speeding convictions and his level of alcohol was at the second highest band of <span class="font-italic">Rafael</span> ... these factors affect the seriousness of his offence <span class="font-italic">to a limited extent</span>” [emphasis added]. First, this undoubtedly could not be right once we appreciate the centrality of the respondent’s high alcohol level in the <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> framework as highlighted above. Second, the DJ’s consideration of the respondent’s status as a “repeat offender” (GD at [59]) was somewhat cursory and inadequate. An additional and more crucial consideration was that of the respondent being a “serious offender” as it was this aggravated conduct of driving carelessly <span class="font-italic">whilst </span><span class="font-italic">under the influence of drink </span>that Parliament intended to address specifically with more severe punishments (see above at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Putting aside the respondent’s speeding convictions in 1998 and 2004 which relate to his status under s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as a “repeat offender”, the DJ did not appear to have considered the full gamut of the relevant antecedents. The respondent was traced with several compounded offences for speeding (in 1990, 1995, 1998 and 2007), inconsiderate driving (in 2012), and crossing double white lines (in 2020). As the respondent rightly accepted at the hearing, these can be considered in sentencing. However, the respondent submitted that compounded offences should be given less weight. Be that as it may, the DJ appeared to have not considered <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the compounded offences in calibrating the sentence. Even accepting that dated offences can be given less weight,

</div> the latter two offences of inconsiderate driving and crossing double white lines are of recent origin. I was of the view that the respondent’s compounded offences ought to have been considered and given due weight. These offences reveal the respondent’s history of recalcitrance and propensity to flout traffic rules and reinforce the need for a deterrent sentence, both on the basis of individual and general deterrence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In relation to the respondent’s attempt to downplay the aggravating factor under the TIC Charge of failing to take reasonable steps to inform the Victim of the damage and provide the Victim with his particulars,

</div> this must be rejected. The respondent cannot now explain away the purported <span class="font-italic">reasonableness</span> of his conduct (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, that he allegedly “waited a while” for the Victim, he was “not able to write any note as being illiterate he simply did not know how or what to write” and he “left his car in the lot just behind the victim’s car in a manner which left no doubt that it was [his] car which caused the damage”). He had already consented to the TIC charge of failing to take <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> steps to inform the Victim of the damage and provide his particulars. In any event, none of these facts are indicated in the Statement of Facts and as such are unproven.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The respondent’s plea of guilt and voluntary restitution were valid mitigating factors, but they did not bring the present case below the custodial threshold. As the Prosecution highlighted, in both <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Shin Seung Ho </span>[2023] SLR(StC) 78<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ashwin Kumar Kumaraswamy </span><span class="font-italic">Sanketh </span>[2023] SLR(StC) 104, the offenders pleaded guilty and made full restitution. Nonetheless, custodial sentences were meted out as these mitigating factors merited only a downward adjustment from the starting point of a higher custodial sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The respondent raised a further objection based on the rule against double counting.

</div> The respondent submitted that the imposition of a custodial sentence on the Careless Driving Offence and the imposition of a fine under the Drink Driving Charge would be akin to giving him a <span class="font-italic">consecutive</span> (as opposed to concurrent) sentence on the two charges and punishing him twice on the same set of acts. I did not find this convincing. The respondent had after all accepted that a court is not prevented “from imposing a condign sentence for the offence under s 64 and, separately, a fine for the offence under s 67, where that is considered appropriate.” (<span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [65]). The application of the totality principle addresses the respondent’s objection. As Menon CJ explained in <span class="font-italic">Wu </span><span class="font-italic">Zhi Yong</span> at [65], “the totality principle, which allows for the adjustment of individual fines so that the cumulative fine is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality” is such that it “enable[s] the court to deal with any concern of unfairness arising from double or excessive punishment.” The totality principle, being of general application, is not, as the respondent alleged, merely confined to “the context of s 64, where an offender had driven recklessly or dangerously whilst under the influence of drink.”
