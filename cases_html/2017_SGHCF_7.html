</div> The alternative value of $39,000, which was the Wife’s first figure, reflected the market value of the shares in February 2013, but those shares had depreciated to around $26,000 by December 2013, which was a date nearer to the IJ Date. There were, however, aspects not entirely satisfactory about the Husband’s explanation. If indeed the shares had been sold at $25,000 as he claimed, there ought to be some evidence of the sale, which was at a quarter of the purchase price of $100,000. Regarding the Husband’s explanation for the Wife’s last figure of $1,000,000, this was explained as a business contact investing in the same company, [B] Ltd through his account, but there was no explanation of their relationship and how the Husband benefitted from what must be some kind of a commercial arrangement. The timing of the relevant deposits and withdrawal of that $1,000,000 sum also did not perfectly match. On the Husband’s own account, the $1,000,000 withdrawal was made in October 2011 while the deposits totalling that amount were made in April and December 2011, which were curiously far apart and the second deposit, <span class="font-italic">ex post </span>the corresponding withdrawal. I was of the view, nevertheless, that since none of the figures provided by the Wife which comprised her estimate of $1,139,000 were attributable to the specific basket of the Husband’s [B] Ltd shares that were being valued as at December 2013, it would be better to consider the oddly-timed deposits and withdrawal as part of the Wife’s larger contention on the need for an adverse inference to be drawn, rather than to use the Wife’s figure as the value of the [B] Ltd shares specifically.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s proceeds from sale of shares in [C] Pte Ltd</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Wife submitted that $3.1m was paid to the Husband when he sold his shares in [C] Pte Ltd and that he failed to satisfactorily account for those proceeds. The Husband did not dispute that he was paid this $3.1m for a project known as the [Ch] Project. He did, however, submit that these monies were paid to him before the divorce proceedings had commenced, and explained his use of the money by reference to a table setting out the debits from, and credits into, his various investment accounts.

This was a substantial sum which expenditure must be accounted for. The Husband’s bald contention was that part of these monies was spent on the family and on mortgage payments for their real properties. In the light of the Husband’s contentions, and there being no value of the expended surplus attributable specifically to these [C] Pte Ltd’s shares, I was of the view that it would be better to deal with the Wife’s submissions on this issue, as with the contentions surrounding the proceeds to be attributed to sale of the shares of [B] Ltd, on a holistic basis under the analysis on adverse inference against the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Valuation of the Husband’s interests in [D] Pte Ltd and [E] Ltd</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Husband produced valuation reports for his two companies, [D] Pte Ltd, in which the Husband held 50% of its issued shares, and [E] Group Ltd, in which the Husband held 12.5%. [D] Pte Ltd was a joint venture between the Husband and a partner company which was set up in 2009. [E] Ltd, in turn, was a joint venture between [D] Pte Ltd and a Chinese company, set up to invest in [A] Inc. In order to have greater control over [A] Inc as its Asian investors, the Husband became [E]’s nominee director on its Board, and later, its CEO. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 These valuation reports showed that [D] Pte Ltd was valued at $97,304 as at 31 December 2015.

</div> Both valuations were done on a Net Tangible Asset basis. Thus, the Husband’s position was that his shares in [D] Pte Ltd was worth $48,652 (being 50% of the value of the company) and that no value should be attributed for his shares in [E] Ltd. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Wife submitted that these valuations, and in particular the report on [D] Pte Ltd, were inaccurate and one-sided. In the [D] Pte Ltd report’s reconciliation of intangible assets, a subsidiary (which was not disclosed and of which nothing was known) was struck off because of a disposal of trading shares “to fund Singapore operation (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>)”. No detail as to that disposal could be found, but some $968,249 arising from goodwill on consolidation of that subsidiary was written off for the 2015 accounts. In the same report’s reconciliation of investments in associate companies, it appeared that the net tangible assets of [D] Pte Ltd at 2014 was $7,970,489, but strangely plummeted the next year to $381,060.

</div> The single-line explanation was that this arose from a de-recognition of [E] Ltd, because [D] Pte Ltd’s holding in [E] Ltd was reduced to 25%. The audited accounts upon which the reports were premised were not enclosed within the reports. The Wife questioned the independence of the valuation reports, which she suggested may had been tailored to aid the position of the Husband.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Counsel for the Wife had a point regarding the probative value of the valuations and the valuer. In my judgment, however, <span class="font-italic">b</span><span class="font-italic">etween</span> the Wife’s reliance on paid up share capital and the Husband’s reliance on net tangible assets, the latter was more reliable. The paid up share capital is a historical figure and not an accurate reflection of the present value of the companies. Further, while counsel for the Wife queried the plummeting of the $7.98m net tangible asset figure in 2014 to $381,060 in 2015, he did not provide the court with any viable alternatives. He did not object to the December 2015 date of assessment used in the report, and yet he provided no alternative figure to the company’s net tangible asset in 2015. Nor did he submit that the 2014 figure should be adopted. The Husband’s valuation of the companies was therefore the only available valuation before the court, and I accordingly adopted it despite my reservations. Nevertheless, while I used the Husband’s valuation of [D] Pte Ltd and [E] Group Ltd for the purposes of the delineating the asset pool, it was clear that the two companies formed a vehicle and platform for the Husband to pursue other business interests, as he had with the Chinese company which placed him as [E] Ltd’s nominee director in [A] Inc, which was in turn a stepping stone to his placement as CEO of [A] Inc. For this reason, necessary adjustments were made later in the final orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s cash deposits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Wife contended that the Husband failed to satisfactorily account for $5,314,122 which was deposited into the Husband’s bank accounts as cash and subsequently withdrawn.

</div> The Wife submitted that this sum should be included as part of the matrimonial pool. While initially agreeing to use the IJ Date as the operative date for determining the assets constituting the matrimonial pool, the Wife somewhat reneged from that position by claiming that reasons existed for including this particular sum in the pool even though it was accrued post-IJ Date. In reliance on <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> [2016] 2 SLR 686 (“<span class="font-italic">ARY</span> <span class="font-italic">v ARX</span>”), she contended that the Husband had in 2012 deserted her and their son, who has special needs, to pursue his new life and new career in the US. He was able to do this only because the Wife fulfilled all their shared marital duties while he was away. Further, even before the Husband’s relocation to US, the Wife had been the sole caregiver of the son, thereby allowing the Husband to concentrate on his work and eventually find the opportunity to pursue a lucrative career in the US.

In his first two years with [A] Inc, his evidence was that he earned only $3,000 a month because his involvement was being tested,

</div> In my view, the Husband’s gambling losses had not been sufficiently accounted for. It was insufficient for him to simply assert that such significant expenditures were part of his business activities. Such a claim, just like the Husband’s claims of reinvestment of the surplus from the investment accounts, was all too convenient to make. Without some form of evidence to back up the assertions, which the Husband was uniquely placed to produce, these claims were essentially irrefutable. The Wife submitted that the gambling losses should be notionally added back to the pool for being unreasonably depleted. She further submitted that a fair credit should be given for the Husband’s gambling gains of $136,000, such that a total sum of around $364,000 should be added back to the asset pool.

</div>  I agreed that gambling losses are not reasonable expenditure.

</div> His submission were suggestive of a last minute attempt to contend dissipation on her part in retaliation to her contentions as to dissipation on his part. All things considered, <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the Wife’s explanation of these withdrawals were not entirely satisfactory, her alleged dissipation of about $589,000 had to be considered in the context of the Husband’s dissipation of a far larger sum. This was not a case where “any adverse inference I can draw against one party would be met and neutralised by an adverse inference against the other party” (<span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2016] SGHC 44 (“<span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span>”) at [119]). As highlighted above, the Husband’s gross admitted gambling expenses already came to some $500,000. I was thus of the view that, considering also the unexplained movements in the Husband’s investment accounts, any dissipation on his part was larger than the sum at hand which he contended remained unaccounted for by the Wife. Accordingly, an uplift in favour of the Wife remains necessary to give effect to the more significant adverse inference drawn against the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Excluded items</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In this case, each party was driving a car that was held in the other party’s name.

</div> It was not disputed that the couple had owned several properties in a series of acquisitions. Their first home was sold and two others purchased, with rent from one going towards the mortgage for the other. Another home was purchased in 2008 with proceeds from the earlier two, and then later, the Balmoral condominium and the Simei flat. As the Wife had worked from 1990 to 2005, her CPF and cash savings went into the earlier properties.

It was undisputed that the parties had bought and sold various properties in the lead up to the purchase of the Balmoral condominium. For these earlier properties, the Wife had contributed CPF and cash from her working years. Any rental yield and other proceeds from these properties would thus have to be attributed in proportion between the parties. The Husband submitted that the Wife contributed around $90,000 via CPF to the first property purchased by the parties sometime in 2009, and thereafter merely turned over the same sum when old properties were sold for newer acquisitions. Thus, the Wife was said to have contributed no more than around $90,000 to the purchase of any properties.

</div> I did not accept this. Many of the Husband’s statements of the property acquisition history were vague, unsupported, and did not stand scrutiny even if taken at their highest. For instance, instead of showing specifically that he was solely responsible for the purchase price of one “River Place”, he merely contended that since there had been no excess in rental received from another property after its mortgage repayment was made, he must have been the party who wholly contributed to River Place.

</div> The relevance of IVF treatment to indirect contribution, in recognition of the “high toll” it exacts on the mother, physically, emotionally and psychologically, was recognised by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">AVM v AWH</span> [2015] SGHC 194 (at [64]). Further, even after the birth of their son, it must have been extremely difficult for the Wife to serve as the primary caregiver of their son who, being on the autistic spectrum, required particular care and attention. Reference was made to <span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span>, where the High Court augmented the wife’s indirect contribution because the son’s special needs had required more by way of indirect contribution from the wife (at [159]). Save for the first ten months, the Wife also managed throughout these 17 years without a helper. After the Husband’s relocation to the US in 2012, even though he continued to pay for the mortgage, home outgoings and the son’s classes, the Wife had to bear even greater responsibility in taking care of the son and household, and together they managed on only about $2,500 each month. While the Husband contended that his pay was $3,000 per month for the first two years of his involvement with [A] Inc, this was a unilateral and strategic move on his part to enhance his career, with attendant sacrifices made on the part of his family. On the balance of considerations, it was clear that the Wife made significantly greater indirect contribution to the family across the length of the marriage than the Husband, who concentrated on his career throughout the marriage, travelled extensively, and left the household to the care of the Wife. I therefore set the ratio for indirect contribution at 75:25 in favour of the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 3: Adjustment of the average ratio </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>, the Court of Appeal set out the following non-exhaustive circumstances where the court could shift the average of the direct and indirect contribution ratios in favour of one party: (a) the length of the marriage, with indirect contributions featuring more prominently in long marriages; (b) the size of the matrimonial assets and its constituents, if extraordinarily large; and (c) the extent and nature of indirect contributions made (at [27]). Fundamental to this case is the Court of Appeal’s additional guidance that adjustments could be made for the factors stipulated in ss 112 and 114 of the WC (at [28]), and to give effect to any adverse inference (at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As explained earlier, I decided to use the uplift approach to address the adverse inference because it was not practicable to come to a finite sum for the Husband’s non-disclosure. The cases adopting an uplift approach cover a broad range of facts. In <span class="font-italic">Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo</span> [2007] SGHC 150, the High Court upheld the decision of the district judge who increased the wife’s share from 50% to 70% on account of husband’s failure to give full and frank disclosure of his assets (at [45]). In <span class="font-italic">Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</span> [2011] 4 SLR 875, the wife was awarded a further 10% of the value of the disclosed assets of $10.95m (at [52]). Therefore, the wife was awarded 30% of all the remaining assets save for the matrimonial property, which was separately divided. While the general uplift approach may be criticised as being arbitrary since there is no objective value to which it may take reference (<span class="font-italic">AZZ v BAA</span> at [120]), I considered that some degree of arbitrariness was inevitable as adverse inferences were drawn precisely to deal with situations of imperfect and incomplete information, and discarding the uplift approach entirely may create a perverse incentive for parties to tactically craft non-attributable non-disclosure. In the final analysis, much would depend on the facts, and in determining the appropriate uplift, the court will be guided by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the evidence before it as to the extent of non-disclosure relative to the value of the disclosed assets.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the facts of this case, this was not an extraordinarily long marriage nor was the asset pool extraordinarily large. If equal weightage was given to both direct and indirect limbs, the final division ratio would be 55:45 in favour of the Husband. In my judgment, two factors called for a more unusual order in this case: (a) the adverse inference drawn against the Husband’s financial position, and (b) the needs of the family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I have set out my reasons on drawing an adverse inference against the Husband above. In respect of the family’s needs, of relevance was the fact that the son was on the autistic spectrum. In view of this, the stability and familiarity of living environment were both fundamental to his continued wellbeing. The Balmoral condominium is also a short walk from his school and convenient for the family. The Husband, to his credit, recognised this fact and offered to allow the Wife and the son to continue residing in the Balmoral condominium, and to transfer the property to the Wife after it has been paid down or the son completes his university education, whichever is later. In the meantime, he also indicated a willingness to continue paying the mortgage payments and outgoings of the Balmoral condominium, in recognition of the fact that any move to a new home and change in environment would be unsettling for the son.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The issue, then, was whether I should defer the sale of the Balmoral condominium on the terms suggested by the Husband, or to order the transfer of the property immediately. The loan redemption would cost about $750,000. Adding the value of this mortgage redemption into the original asset pool of $2,686,883.57 would give a new value of $3,436,883.57, an enhancement of 22% within the new pool. The question that was crucial here was whether the Husband had at hand a source of funds to pay down the outstanding loan on the property and effect its transfer.

</div> Having regard to all the facts, I was certain that he would be able to do so. He was clearly a man of substantial means and connections. Prior to setting up his various businesses, he had been the Managing Director and Singapore Market Head of private banking in a large and well-respected international bank. The couple’s real estate transactions in the run up to the Balmoral condominium purchase were also clearly astute business decisions. Parties did not dispute that the Husband had planned and effected these property investments. His bank accounts continued to show very high investment activity but his investment portfolio, which would no doubt have been impressive given his credentials and history, was not before the court. Further, since April 2014, he earned, as President and CEO of [A] Inc, a yearly salary of US$300,000.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Wife’s Supplemental Submissions dated 7 November 2016 at para 80.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> To this end, although he claimed to have paid 40% taxes in the US, no tax returns were adduced, but only the 2014 contract of employment. Indeed, those tax returns, to which the Husband had particular access, would also have shed light on the other sources of income that the Husband had, at least within the US. For these reasons, I did not accept the Husband’s submission that he was not in a position to pay up the mortgage loan on the Balmoral condominium. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, I preferred to make an order of transfer as opposed to a deferment of sale of the Balmoral condominium. I further ordered that the Husband’s CPF contribution to the Balmoral condominium of around $310,000 should not be returned to him. This sum was smaller than the gambling losses of some $364,000 mentioned at [27], which the Husband had admitted formed part of his expenditure. This was, to my mind, a necessary accompaniment to my order of transfer. The Wife did not have the financial capacity to make repayment to the Husband on the execution of such transfer. Further, I took notice of the fact that the Husband had other CPF monies held in the Simei flat, and some $200,178 left in his CPF accounts. This order was thus unlikely to be oppressive to the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 My order of transfer as such was not, and probably ought not to be, a typical order made to give effect to an adverse inference. On the special facts of this particular case before me, I was of the view that such a transfer constituted a just and equitable division between the parties. Stability in home environment was pivotal to the son’s wellbeing. Between deferring the sale and ordering a transfer, the latter would give certainty to the family. The Husband had already relocated to the US. Deferring the sale would leave the care arrangements for the family, and especially the welfare of the son, open to the vicissitudes of life for another 10 years or so. Plans, and even orders, as regards the future could become impracticable in that timeframe. For those reasons, I decided that it would be just and equitable, having regard to all the circumstances and in particular the needs of this family, to order a transfer of the Balmoral condominium free of encumbrance to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mechanics of allocation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In light of the above, I made the following orders to give effect to my decision as to division. Parties were to retain all assets in their own names. The Balmoral condominium was to be transferred to the Wife within six months of the date of my judgment, to be held in her sole name free of encumbrance. The Husband would bear the costs of the transfer and there would no repayment of the monies used by the Husband from his CPF account for the acquisition of the Balmoral condominium. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Wife and son</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Husband, as CEO of [A] Inc, had a net after-tax monthly income of $21,000, not considering bonuses, share options and other emoluments. The Wife, on the other hand, stopped working since 2005 in the parties’ attempt to conceive a child.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Maintenance for the son</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Parties’ last assessment regarding their son’s condition was as at 15 April 2011. As more than 5 years had since elapsed, I called for a fresh assessment, which was completed by the Child Guidance Clinic. The reports indicated that the son had high cognitive abilities. As he was on the autistic spectrum, various classes were also recommended to help him improve his socialisation and communication skills.

</div> As the Wife would have to bear the responsibility for these outgoings on behalf of herself and the son by virtue of my order on the Balmoral condominium, I added $500 per month to account for the son’s share of the utilities and similar outgoings.

In this case, however, there was uncertainty in respect of the son’s future academic plans. While he was at the time of the hearing within the mainstream school system, his teachers reported that his work was not consistent. The reports opined that, going forward, he would require consistent learning support at home. The son would be taking his PSLE in two years’ time. While he was of a high cognitive ability, the local school system is a highly competitive one. His special needs would likely mean that he would require a greater level of support and attention than other teenagers, especially if he is to stay within the mainstream school system into the longer term. He would have to find coping mechanisms for the challenges highlighted in the report in respect of adaptive functioning, peer and teacher related social interaction, and the ability to do group work. His sole source of support was his mother. The Child Guidance Clinic also indicated, based on the school report, that the son may additionally have attention deficit disorder.

</div> Counsel for the Husband countered that $4,000 a month was more than sufficient and pointed out that the Balmoral outgoings, absent the mortgage repayments, would not be more than $1,000. Having regard to her expenses and the fact that she would now take over responsibility to repay the outgoings for the Balmoral condominium, I set the monthly maintenance for the Wife at $4,000 a month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I envisaged that the Wife should eventually re-enter the workforce and secure financial independence for herself. She was 50 years of age and ought in due course to be able to do so. I therefore considered if I should set this periodic sum only for a specific period. However, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the son’s longer term arrangements, I was of the view that the couple ought to settle his future first, in particular his post-PSLE school placement, before considering a re-arrangement of the Wife’s maintenance. Their so doing could then mark a material change in circumstance, in view of the premise upon which her periodic maintenance order was made.
