In the court below, the Respondent pleaded guilty to two charges. The District Judge (“DJ”) imposed on him a Short Detention Order of 14 days and a Day Reporting Order of nine months. The Prosecution appealed against that decision. After hearing submissions from the Prosecution and the Respondent, I allowed the appeal and imposed a global sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment. I delivered an oral judgment at the appeal hearing and now provide the detailed reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Respondent, Satesh s/o Navarlan, was a 34-year-old Singaporean at the time of the offences. The victim is his wife, who was residing with him at the material time of the offences. In the court below, he pleaded guilty to one charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) for contravening a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”), and one charge under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for voluntarily causing hurt to his wife. One other charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter and one other charge under s 323 of the Penal Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. At the time of the offences, the Respondent was subject to a PPO under s 65 of the Women’s Charter, issued on 18 September 2014, which restrained the Respondent from using family violence against his wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The offences took place in the home of the Respondent and his wife. The Statement of Facts stated that in the early morning of 1 February 2018, the Respondent returned home, intoxicated. The wife was in the bedroom with their five-year-old daughter when the Respondent entered at about 2.30am and grabbed the blanket away from his wife. He grabbed her right leg and bit it. These facts formed the subject matter of the charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter which the Respondent pleaded guilty to and the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code that was taken into consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 About 10 minutes later, the wife asked the Respondent to wash up because he smelled of alcohol. The Respondent responded strangely by rolling around on the bed. Worried for their daughter, the wife brought her out of the bedroom into the living room. The Respondent followed them out and an argument ensued between the Respondent and his wife. The argument became heated and the Respondent threw several punches at his wife. The wife got hold of an umbrella that was near her and attempted to use it to block these punches. However, the Respondent managed to land a punch on his wife’s left cheek. The attack did not stop there. The Respondent grabbed the umbrella away from his wife and swung it at her, using it to hit her on both flanks. These facts formed the subject matter of the charge under s 323 of the Penal Code which the Respondent pleaded guilty to and the charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter that was taken into consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Their daughter informed the Respondent’s father about the incident after witnessing it. The Respondent’s father, who was also residing in the flat, tried to separate the Respondent and his wife. The wife tried to call the police with her hand-phone but the Respondent snatched it from her and threw it on the floor before she could make the call. The wife fled from the flat with the daughter and then called the police. She was found to suffer from “tenderness over her left cheek, forehead, left side of neck and left chest wall with thoracic region” as a result of the Respondent’s attacks. She was discharged with medication for the contusions. Since then, she has been seeking refuge at a community shelter and has not returned home to live with the Respondent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The proceedings in the District Court </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ sentencing positions  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of four weeks in the light of precedents and the aggravating factors in the present case, including the fact that the violent acts were committed in the context of familial relations and in the presence of the Respondent’s young daughter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Respondent, in mitigation, submitted for a high fine to be imposed. His counsel highlighted that the set of offences was a once-off event which happened spontaneously in the context of an argument between the Respondent and his wife. The Respondent claimed that it was his wife who had first hit him with a television remote control and he bit her leg in retaliation. Similarly, he punched her because she tried to hit him when he attempted to stop her from leaving the bedroom and he grabbed the umbrella after she pointed it at him. These were events which the Respondent was only able to reconstruct from an email of 8 Feb 2018 sent by his wife to her lawyer (for the purpose of commencing divorce proceedings) which she forwarded to the Respondent upon his request. Additionally, his counsel submitted that he had joined Alcoholic Anonymous and attended his first meeting on 9 June 2018 to address his alcoholic problem. The Respondent was also gainfully employed. The counsel highlighted that the wife had reconciled with him and would stay with him on weekends.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The DJ’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The DJ imposed on the Respondent a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) of 14 days and a Day Reporting Order (“DRO”) of nine months, together with electronic monitoring, compulsory counselling sessions and a treatment programme at the National Addiction Management Services. These sentences were stayed pending the Prosecution’s appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In his grounds of decision reported at <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Satesh s/o Navarlan</span> [2019] SGMC 3 (the “GD”), having decided that the nature and extent of the violence caused the custodial threshold to be crossed (GD at [31]), the DJ nevertheless thought that there was “sufficient ground to view rehabilitation with some prospect” (GD at [35]). He appeared to have come to such a conclusion on two grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Respondent enrolled himself with Alcoholics Anonymous after he was charged with the present offences (GD at [33]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Respondent asserted that his wife had reconciled with him and that she and their daughter would stay with the Respondent during weekends (GD at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The DJ explained that imposing DRO with conditions to ensure that the Respondent would follow through with his promise to reform and deal with his drinking problem and SDO for deterrent effect would clearly be able to better advance the twin interests of “bringing the message of the seriousness of domestic violence” to the Respondent and “giving the chance to [him] to deal with his underlying issue of drinking to reduce the risk of re-offending in the future” (GD at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Prosecution appealed against the community-based sentences imposed by the DJ. The Prosecution submitted that the dominant sentence in this case should be deterrence, both general and specific, and that the DJ accorded too much weight to the principle of rehabilitation and the mitigation plea.

Counsel argued that the DJ did not hold rehabilitation to be the primary sentencing consideration and the very choice of a SDO over other community-based sentences demonstrated an acute awareness of the need to address the element of deterrence and retribution. The DJ, according to the Respondent, had taken a nuanced approach to arrive at a fairly-calibrated balance of the sentencing principles.

Thus, there is a strong need to deter anyone who might resort to such violence (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span> <span class="font-italic">Luan Yuanxin</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 613 (“<span class="font-italic">Luan Yuanxin</span>”) at [17]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Wong Leong Chin</span> at [49], the High Court observed that “[p]ublic policy requires that vulnerable members of the family such as wives and children should be protected from violence”. The High Court explained that a deterrent sentence in the form of imprisonment should be imposed in deserving cases of family violence, while sentences of fines may be more appropriate only in less serious cases in which no or little violence is involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It is clear therefore that the principle of deterrence features prominently in offences of domestic violence. The present case is no exception. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The gravity of the offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Respondent highlighted that his wife’s injuries were not serious. The injuries might not be very serious but the Respondent’s culpability was certainly very high. The Respondent’s relentless assault against his wife in the presence of their then five-year-old daughter after returning home in an intoxicated state at past 2am and rudely waking them up showed his true self. He bit her right leg. Later, he could even laugh and mock the way his wife held an umbrella to ward him off. He snatched the umbrella from her and used it to hit her body while sarcastically and sadistically telling her, “This is how it works!”.

The law is clear that voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol aggravates rather than mitigates an offence that results from such drunkenness. The Respondent had an alcohol problem for more than 10 years and the most recent recorded manifestation of his problem was in the PPO made against him in 2014 for the protection of his wife.

</div> the Respondent stated that “I would like to reiterate that the offence is out of character for which I am extremely remorseful...”. Such a statement showed that he was either in denial or was simply unable to appreciate his propensity for violence against his wife, particularly when he had consumed too much alcohol. The present offences were certainly not out of character with his conduct leading to his wife applying for a PPO against him in 2014. Consuming too much alcohol and getting into trouble was also not new to him. He was convicted and imprisoned in 2007 and again in 2013 for drink-driving.

</div> the offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 323 of the Penal Code (among other charges). The offender had strangled his wife with a copper wire and had bitten her right hand. With help from their eight-year-old daughter and the wife’s elderly mother, the wife finally managed to free herself from the offender’s hold. The High Court imposed the maximum sentence of one year’s imprisonment for each charge, considering the violence and viciousness of the offender’s acts, that some degree of premeditation was involved in the attack, the considerable degree of force which the offender used and his corresponding intention to cause his wife serious injury as well as the offender’s verbal threat to strangle her to death while tightening the wire around her neck (at [12] and [14]). The High Court also gave due weight to the fact that the offender carried out the attack in front of the eight-year-old daughter who had to witness the violent attack on her mother by her own father (at [16]). The High Court stressed the importance of deterring anyone who might resort to familial violence (at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Violent acts such as these are particularly heinous when they are committed within the confines of a familial relationship as they constitute an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members.

Justice of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang):</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> High Court</em> allows prosecution’s appeal on
sentence against decision of the lower court in a case involving family
violence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This
was an appeal against the sentence ordered by the lower court in a case
involving family violence. The Respondent had pleaded guilty to two charges,
and the District Judge (“DJ”) imposed on him a Short Detention Order of 14 days
and a Day Reporting Order of nine months. The Prosecution’s appeal against that
decision was allowed. The High Court set aside the sentence below and imposed a
global sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment: <strong>[1]</strong>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
Respondent was a 34-year-old Singaporean at the time of the offences. The
victim is his wife, who was residing with him at the material time of the
offences. In the court below, he pleaded guilty to one charge under s 65(8) of
the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) for contravening a Personal
Protection Order (“PPO”), and one charge under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap
224, 2008 Rev Ed) for voluntarily causing hurt to his wife. One other charge under
s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter and one other charge under s 323 of the Penal
Code were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. At the time
of the offences, the Respondent was subject to a PPO which restrained the
Respondent from using family violence against his wife: <strong>[2]</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
offences took place in the home of the Respondent and his wife. In the early
morning of 1 February 2018, the Respondent returned home, intoxicated. The wife
was in the bedroom with their five-year-old daughter when the Respondent
entered at about 2.30am and grabbed the blanket away from his wife. He grabbed
her right leg and bit it: <strong>[3]</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">About
10 minutes later, the wife asked the Respondent to wash up because he smelled
of alcohol. The Respondent responded strangely by rolling around on the bed.
Worried for their daughter, the wife brought her out of the bedroom into the
living room. The Respondent followed them out and an argument ensued between
the Respondent and his wife. The argument became heated and the Respondent
threw several punches at his wife. The wife got hold of an umbrella that was
near her and attempted to use it to block these punches. However, the
Respondent managed to land a punch on his wife’s left cheek. The attack did not
stop there. The Respondent grabbed the umbrella away from his wife and swung it
at her, using it to hit her on both flanks: <strong>[4]</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Their
daughter informed the Respondent’s father about the incident after witnessing
it. The Respondent’s father, who was also residing in the flat, tried to
separate the Respondent and his wife. The wife tried to call the police with
her hand-phone but the Respondent snatched it from her and threw it on the
floor before she could make the call. The wife fled from the flat with the
daughter and then called the police. She was found to suffer from “tenderness
over her left cheek, forehead, left side of neck and left chest wall with
thoracic region” as a result of the Respondent’s attacks. She was discharged
with medication for the contusions. Since then, she has been seeking refuge at
a community shelter and has not returned home to live with the Respondent: <strong>[5]</strong>. </span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
principle of deterrence features prominently in offences of domestic violence.
The present case is no exception: <strong>[14]</strong>.</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Respondent’s culpability was very
high. The Respondent relentlessly assaulted against his wife in the presence of
their then five-year-old daughter after returning home in an intoxicated state
at past 2am and rudely waking them up. He bit her right leg. Later, he could
even laugh and mock the way his wife held an umbrella to ward him off. He
snatched the umbrella from her and used it to hit her body while sarcastically
and sadistically telling her, “This is how it works!”.  He tried to stop her from leaving the flat
after assaulting her and chased her to the lift when she managed to escape from
the flat. The Respondent’s conduct greatly affected his wife’s and their young
daughter’s sense of security and peace of mind. The wife even decided to seek
refuge at a family centre and filed for divorce one week after the assault
(though the divorce action was discontinued): <strong>[15]</strong> and <strong>[16]</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">           
</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
law is clear that voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol aggravates rather than
mitigates an offence that results from such drunkenness. The Respondent had an
alcohol problem for more than 10 years – the PPO against him in 2014 for the
protection of his wife was issued after he had pushed his wife while he was in
an intoxicated state, injuring her. Nevertheless, the Respondent continued with
his excessive consumption of alcohol: <strong>[17]</strong>.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
Respondent had a lack of rehabilitative prospects. The present offences were
not out of character with his conduct leading to his wife applying for a PPO
against him in 2014. Consuming too much alcohol and getting into trouble was
also not new to him. He was convicted and imprisoned in 2007 and again in 2013
for drink-driving. His sudden decision to enrol with Alcoholics Anonymous after
he was charged with the present offences did not appear to be motivated by true
remorse but appeared to be a tactical move for his mitigation plea: <strong>[18]</strong> and <strong>[19]</strong>. </span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
present offences did not fall under the categories for which community-based
sentencing was envisaged. There was nothing to suggest that the Respondent’s
capacity for rehabilitation was so promising that the option of community-based
sentencing would be appropriate in the present case: <strong>[23]</strong>.</span></p>

</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Given
the strong stance taken against family violence, custodial sentences have been
imposed for breaches of PPOs: <strong>[24]</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -33pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">

High Court imposed imprisonment terms of three weeks for the charge of breach

imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently, giving a total sentence of
