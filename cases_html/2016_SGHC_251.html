</div> The answers were given by one [G], a director of D3, who took the position that D3 was “unable to answer the interrogatories as it does not possess any information as to the matters therein, within its present records or within the knowledge of its employees or officers”. [G] also stated in his affidavit that he was appointed as a director of D3 on 5 January 2015 after D1 ceased to be a director/officer of D3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">D2’s application to stay the proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the meanwhile, D2 was served with the writ of summons and statement of claim on 16 March 2016 and entered appearance on 18 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On 18 April 2016, D2 applied for a stay of proceedings pending the SIAC Arbitration pursuant to s 6 of the IAA.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On 29 June 2016, the defendants applied to the arbitral tribunal in the SIAC Arbitration to restrain the plaintiff and [TN] from taking any further steps in the present action “immediately after the stay of [the action] in respect of [D2]”. The application was adjourned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On 4 July 2016, I heard D2’s application. The plaintiff agreed to the application for a stay but asked that the stay be made subject to the Condition. I granted the stay subject to the Condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On 29 July 2016, D2 filed its appeal to the Court of Appeal against the imposition of the Condition.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reasons for the Condition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Section 6(1) of the IAA provides for international arbitration agreements to be enforced by way of applications to stay court proceedings. Section 6(2) of the IAA then provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court to which an application has been made in accordance with subsection (1) shall make an order, <span class="font-italic">upon such terms or conditions as it may think fit</span>, staying the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to the matter, unless it is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The discretion of the court to impose terms and conditions upon a stay in favour of arbitration is unfettered although it must be exercised judiciously: <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Duden”</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 984 at [12] and [14]. The court is entitled to impose terms and conditions as appear reasonable or required by the ties of justice: <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Duden”</span> at [15]–[16]; <span class="font-italic">PT Budi </span><span class="font-italic">Semestra Satria v Concordia Agritrading Pte Ltd</span> [1998] SGHC 127 at [13].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As stated earlier (see [30] above), the plaintiff’s position was that it needed the answers to the interrogatories so that it could follow, trace and recover the Monies from the third parties to whom the Monies had been paid. The plaintiff submitted that it was necessary for D1 to answer the interrogatories on behalf of D2 for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The documents obtained pursuant to the Banker’s Book Order showed that the Monies paid into D3’s Singapore Account had been paid out to third parties. Significantly, the documents did not show: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) any funds being transferred to the JV Co as required under the Master Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether the funds were transferred for purposes under the Master Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) why the funds were transferred to the various third parties; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) what consideration, if any, the various third parties provided for receiving the funds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) During the hearing of D3’s application for a stay, D3 had argued that it would be embarrassed by having to answer the interrogatories before the statement of claim was filed in the SIAC Arbitration and that the interrogatories would be answered in the statement of claim to be filed in the SIAC Arbitration. The court ordered D3 to answer the interrogatories one day after the deadline for filing the statement of claim in the SIAC Arbitration. However, the statement of claim that was subsequently filed in the SIAC Arbitration on 6 June 2016 did not provide any answer to the interrogatories.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) D3 had not even attempted to obtain information from D1 when answering the interrogatories served on it. D1 had authorised and directed the payments of the Monies and was a director of D3 at the time the payments were made and remained the beneficial owner of D3.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) D2 had admitted in its letter dated 14 September 2011 that the Monies had been received by it and that they would be used in accordance with the Master Agreement. However, D2 had not provided details as to how the Monies had been utilised.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) D1 was the sole commissioner of D2. D2 was a company within the [PTP] Group which was founded by D1 and of which D1 was the chairman.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 D2 did not dispute the court’s discretion to impose terms and conditions upon a stay of proceedings under s 6(2) of the IAA. However, D2 objected to the Condition on two grounds. First, D2 submitted that the plaintiff had no basis to go after the third parties who received the Monies because the Master Agreement did not require the Monies to be used for the joint venture. The Supplementary Agreement had such a requirement but D2’s case was that the Supplementary Agreement was not binding as its execution was not authorised by D1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 D2’s first ground of objection went to the general question whether the interrogatories were necessary. In my view, whether the Supplementary Agreement was binding on D1 and if not, whether the Monies were required by the Master Agreement to be used for the joint venture, were not questions that could be determined at this stage. I also agreed with the plaintiff that D2’s assertion that the defendants were free to use the Monies as their own seemed to be an afterthought. In its letter dated 14 September 2011 to the plaintiff, D2 had clearly stated that the Monies had been received by it and “shall be utilized in accordance to the… Master Agreement” (see [10] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Next, D2 submitted that the plaintiff’s application to serve interrogatories on D2 ought to be made to the arbitral tribunal in the SIAC Arbitration first. Only if the arbitral tribunal decided that the matter was not within the scope of the arbitration could the plaintiff then seek assistance from the court. This was D2’s main objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I agreed with the plaintiff that since the interrogatories were solely to enable the plaintiff to take action against third parties, the issue relating to the interrogatories was of no concern to the arbitral tribunal in the SIAC Arbitration. Requiring the plaintiff to apply to the arbitral tribunal for such interrogatories would be an exercise in futility. The arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction being consensual, there was no reason for it to concern itself with interrogatories for the purpose of following and tracing the Monies to third parties who were not parties to the arbitration or the arbitration agreement. D2 did not produce any authority in support of its claim that the scope of the SIAC Arbitration would include ordering such interrogatories.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the circumstances, I saw no necessity to require the plaintiff to make the application to the arbitral tribunal first. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Post script</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On 1 August 2016, D2 applied for a stay of the Condition pending its appeal to the Court of Appeal.
