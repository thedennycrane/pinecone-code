        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Chai Cher Watt
                        (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) v SDL Technologies Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 348 (“the Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The proceedings below involved claims by Chai
                    Cher Watt (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) (“the
                    Appellant”) against SDL Technologies Pte Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”) for breaches by the latter in respect of two separate
                    contracts to supply the former a drilling and boring machine (“the
                    Drilling Machine”) and a lathe machine (“the Lathe
                    Machine”) (hereafter referred to as “the Drill Contract”
                    and “the Lathe Machine Contract”, respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We would like to note at the outset, that, after
                    considering all the relevant evidence, we agree with the Judge’s reasoning
                    and decision with regard to the Lathe Machine (see the Judgment at [20]–[21]). Indeed, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Hee Theng Fong
                    (“Mr Hee”), himself candidly admitted – correctly, in
                    our view – that the Appellant’s arguments with regard to its claim
                    for breaches of the Lathe Machine Contract were weak. Hence, this part of the
                    appeal fails. As for the Appellant’s claim for alleged breaches of the
                    Drill Contract, this will be dealt with subsequently in greater
                detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The salient facts of this appeal are as follows.
                    In August 2007, the Appellant approached the Respondent’s sales
                    representative indicating his interest in purchasing a boring and drilling
                    machine with a boring depth of 4 metres. Parties then entered into the
                    Drill Contract on 21 August 2007, on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Payment terms:    30% Deposit upon
                        confirmation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">50% Subsequent payment by Cheque or T/T to SDL Technologies after machine
                        inspection at manufacturer plant and before shipping to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">20% Balance payment upon delivery and commissioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Drill Contract also provided a list of specifications of the
                    Drilling Machine, including the fact that it would be 11 metres in length.
                    As required under the Drill Contract, the Appellant then paid 30% of the
                    purchase price as a deposit on 22 August 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In March 2008, the Respondent’s technical
                    and service manager, He Jian Qin (“Xiao He”), approached the
                    Appellant with a drawing of the Drilling Machine (“the First
                    Drawing”), which showed the Appellant where to dig a cavity in the floor
                    for the purposes of installing an L-shaped oil tank for the Drilling Machine,
                    and its dimensions thereof. This First Drawing was a schematic drawing,
                    consisting of line markings, numbers, mandarin notations and a table at the
                    bottom right hand corner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After comparing the First Drawing with floor
                    plans of the factory in which the Appellant intended to store the Drilling
                    Machine (“the Factory”), the Appellant came to realise that a
                    cavity could not be dug in the proposed location due to the presence of a beam
                    in the ground. Hence, further discussions with Xiao He were conducted and at the
                    Appellant’s suggestion, parties finally decided to (i) substitute the
                    L-shaped oil tank with a customised square one and (ii) move the oil tank
                    from adjacent to the Drilling Machine to in front of it. The square oil tank was
                    eventually installed on or about 14 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 19 August 2008, the Drilling Machine was
                    delivered to the Appellant and uncrated in the presence of the Appellant’s
                    foreman, Chai Kok Yong, but it was not inspected. On 20 August 2008, the
                    Appellant acknowledged receipt of the Drilling Machine by signing a delivery
                    order. However, on 23 August 2008, when the Appellant inspected the
                    Drilling Machine, he noted that some parts of it appeared old and of poor
                    quality. This caused him to engage the services of SGS
                    Testing &amp; Control Services Pte Ltd (“SGS”) to carry
                    out an inspection of the Drilling Machine for the purpose of determining if it
                    was new.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the Appellant’s evidence, it
                    was only after SGS’s inspection on 1 September 2008 that he
                    discovered the Drilling Machine was 13.5 metres in length as opposed to
                    11 metres as stated in the Drill Contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to its inspection,
                    SGS also issued a report dated 9 September 2008, which concluded that the
                    Drilling Machine was “in refurbished condition”. Displeased, the
                    Appellant made complaints to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In reply, the Respondent forwarded to the
                    Appellant a letter dated 29 August 2008 written by the manufacturer of the
                    Drilling Machine explaining as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Drilling Machine was
                        purchased by the Respondent from the manufacturer on 31 August 2007;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the
                        length of the Drilling Machine was 13.5 metres in length and not
                        11 metres as the manufacturer had incorrectly informed the Respondent
                        when the contract between them was created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 9 October 2008, the Appellant wrote to
                    the Respondent via their solicitors, rejecting the Drilling
                Machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 1), the Appellant alleged, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that it was either an express or implied term of the Drill Contract that the
                    Drilling Machine was to be “newly manufactured” and therefore the
                    Respondent was in breach for delivering a used and/or reconditioned and/or
                    refurbished machine. Alternatively, the Appellant claimed that the Respondent
                    was in breach for failing to deliver a Drilling Machine that conformed to the
                    specifications set out in the Drill Contract and so sought the following
                    reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The return of deposits paid pursuant
                        to the Drill Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Damages for losses suffered by reason of the
                        Respondent’s breach of the Drill Contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Interest on the aforesaid at the rate
                        of 5.33% per annum, calculated from the date of the writ until the date of
                        judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Drilling Machine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A great number of arguments centring on both
                    law and fact were canvassed by parties before this court. In essence, however,
                    the main (and closely related) issues in this appeal can be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     Firstly, does s 13 of the Sale
                        of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“s 13”) apply
                        to the facts of the present appeal? If not, then what would the applicable
                        legal principles under the common law be?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, what result ought to follow from
                        applying the relevant legal principles to the facts of the present
                        appeal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As is evident from the statement of these two
                    issues, the focus of the first is on the law, whereas the second is on the
                    facts. Looked at in this light, both issues comprise one larger – and
                    holistic as well as integrated – inquiry. It is also significant to note
                    that the second issue is, at least in the context of the present appeal, not an
                    easy one and, as we shall see, in fact poses more difficulties than the
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does s 13 apply?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The provision itself reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Sale by
                        description</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13</b>. —(1) Where there is a contract for
                        the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the
                        goods will correspond with the description.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) If the sale is by sample as well as by description, it is not
                        sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the
                        goods do not also correspond with the description.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by
                        reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the
                        buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Paragraph 4 of the Schedule applies in relation to a contract
                        made before 18th May 1973.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On this issue, it was argued by counsel for
                    the Respondent, Mr Kenny Chooi (“Mr Chooi”), that the
                    Appellant had made no mention of s 13 in the course of pleadings or in
                    trial. Therefore, allowing the Appellant to raise this “new” point
                    at such a late stage would prejudice the Respondent since it had neither led
                    evidence on this point, nor made the relevant submissions in the proceedings
                        below.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We disagree with Mr Chooi’s
                    submission. The fact that s 13 was the operative governing provision in the
                    proceedings below was clear from the Judge’s decision at [7] of the Judgment, where he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I first consider the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to reject
                        the Drilling Machine. <em>It is trite law that in order to
                            repudiate the Drill Contract, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to
                            establish that the defendant had breached a condition of the contract or
                            breached a warranty the consequence of which was to deprive the
                            plaintiff of substantially the whole benefit of the Drill
                            Contract</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge then proceeded to consider the effect of s 13(1), which
                    imposes an implied condition that the goods will correspond with their
                    description in a contract of sale by description. Finally, at [8] of the Judgment, he observed as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The Drill Contract and the Lathe Contract insofar as
                            they contain specifications are contracts of sale by description within
                            the meaning of s 13 of the Sale of Goods Act</em></b>: see
                            <em>Chuan Hiap Seng (1979) Pte Ltd v Progress
                            Manufacturing Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 122. Where the
                        contract contains a detailed description of the goods, minor discrepancies
                        between the delivered goods and their description may entitle the purchaser
                        to reject the goods: <em>Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen &amp;
                            Son</em> [1933] AC 470 at 479. In certain cases, in the absence of
                        detailed commercial description, goods having considerable discrepancy from
                        their described characteristics would nevertheless fall within s 13(1):
                            <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (Sweet
                        &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2010) at para 11-019. Thus, where a
                        contract for a new Singer car was made, it was not satisfied by the delivery
                        of a second hand model: <em>Andrew Bros Ltd v Singer &amp; Co
                            Ltd</em> [1934] 1 KB 17. Also, a contract for a one-year-old
                        second-hand reaping machine which had been used to cut only 50 acres,
                        was held not to have been performed by a very old machine which had been
                        mended: <em>Varley v Whipp</em> [1900] 1 QB 513.
                        [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, a close perusal of the Record of Appeal for this particular
                    case demonstrates that the focus in trial centred around various specifications
                    of the Drilling Machine which were embodied—or, more accurately,
                    described—in the Drilling Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     With respect, therefore, Mr Chooi’s
                    submission is not well founded. In our view, it was clear that whether there had
                    indeed been a sale by description was a central issue below. Even assuming
                    (taking the Respondent’s case at its highest) that there was no literal
                    reference to s 13 in the court below, it is clear that the parties had
                    proceeded on the basis that the case concerned the sale of goods by description
                    within the meaning of s 13. The Respondent could not persuade us that the
                    Appellant’s legal arguments based on s 13 before this court had been
                    sprung on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The application of s 13 to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We now turn, therefore, to apply s 13 to
                    the relevant facts of the present proceedings. However, before proceeding to do
                    so, it is apposite to state briefly what the legal effect is if there is a
                    breach within the meaning of s 13 in general and subsection (1)
                    thereof in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Under s 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act
                    (“the Act”), it is an “<em>implied
                        condition</em>” that the goods will “correspond with the
                    description”. The fact that the wording of s 13(1) classifies every
                    description of the contract categorically as a <em>condition</em> is of crucial significance. Indeed, it shows that the
                    Act focuses on the classification of contractual terms as conditions or
                    warranties (see also s 11(2) of the Act and the definition of
                    “warranty” in s 61(1) of the Act) instead of the nature and
                    consequences of a breach of such terms. This approach is in fact mirrored in the
                    principles of the common law– specifically, in the <em>condition-warranty approach</em> elaborated on by this court in
                        <em>RDC Concrete v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 413 (“<em>RDC Concrete</em>”)
                    at [97]–[98]. Put simply, under both the Act as well as at common law,
                    once a contractual term is classified as a “condition”, it must be
                    strictly complied with. A breach of it, no matter how small, and regardless of
                    the consequences, will entitle the innocent party to treat the contract
                    concerned as discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This is an important point because, with
                    respect, the Judge’s reference at [7] of the Judgment (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) to a breach depriving the innocent party of
                    substantially the whole benefit of the contract confuses the condition-warranty
                    approach under common law and the Act with a rather different test under the
                    common law, namely, the <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach that
                    was based on the classic formulation by Diplock LJ in the oft-cited English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v
                        Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd</em> [1962] 2 QB 26 at [66] (For more
                    details on this test, see <em>RDC Concrete</em>, especially
                    at [99]–[100]). In our view, the <em>Hongkong
                        Fir</em> approach has no relevance to the present appeal. Instead,
                    under the condition-warranty approach embodied in s 13, any breach of any
                    of specifications in the Drill Contract by the Respondent would, subject to the
                        <em>de minimis</em> principle (discussed below at
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>), entitle the Appellant to elect to
                    treat the contract as discharged, and hence succeed in this part of its
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As a closing word on this point, we refer to
                    the following extract from a leading textbook on the sale of goods, <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (8th Ed,
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2010) at paras 11-018–11-019 that, in
                    our view, summarises the position on s 13:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11-018</b>
                
              <b>Failure of goods to “correspond with
                                description”: first type of case</b>. As previously
                            stated, goods have been held not to correspond with their description in
                            two types of case. The first type comprises cases where although the
                            goods are substantially what is required, there is some small
                            discrepancy from the contract particulars. Most of the decisions involve
                            commercial disputes relating to unascertained or future goods, and the
                            discrepancy may appear quite small in such cases. Thus in <em>Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen &amp; Son</em> there was a
                            contract for staves of half an inch thick. Only about 15 per cent
                            conformed with this requirement, but the rest were nearly all less than
                            nine-sixteenths of an inch thick. Despite a finding that the goods were
                            commercially within, and merchantable under, the contract specification,
                            and that they were reasonably fit for their purpose (which was the
                            making of cement barrels), the buyers were held entitled to reject,
                            Lord Atkin saying that “if the seller wants a margin he
                            must, and in my experience does, stipulate for it”. The packing
                            of goods may also form part of their description. Thus in <em>Re Moore &amp; Co and Landauer &amp; Co</em> there
                            was a contract for 3,000 tins of Australian canned fruit packed in
                            cases of 30 tins. The seller supplied a substantial number in cases
                            containing only 24 tins, though the total number of tins was
                            correct. It was held that the buyer could reject the whole consignment.
                            An exception is only made in cases of “microscopic
                                deviation”.<sup></sup>Overseas sales where there are special stipulations as to
                            mode and date of shipment, <em>etc</em>. can be
                            treated under this head also, on the grounds that the extra requirements
                            are part of the description. In <em>Reardon Smith Line
                                Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen</em> Lord Wilberforce thought
                            some of the older cases “excessively technical and due for fresh
                            examination in [the House of Lords]”, and at best was prepared to
                            accept them as relating to “unascertained future goods <em>(e.g</em>. commodities) as to which each detail of
                            the description must be assumed to be vital”. The famous decision
                            in <em>Bowes v Shand</em>, that goods can be
                            rejected because shipment was not completed within the specified period,
                            has however been reaffirmed by the House of Lords in the leading case of
                                <em>Bunge Corp v Tradax Export SA</em> and is
                            still clearly valid. It is presumably to be brought within the exception
                            to which Lord Wilberforce referred. It should be noted that remedies for
                            defects in <em>quantity</em> are more specific and
                            separately dealt with in s.30 of the Act. They do not normally,
                            therefore, involve the application of s.13 unless only damages are
                            claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>11-019</b>
                
              <b>Second type of case</b>. The second type comprises
                            cases where in the absence of detailed commercial description the goods
                            supplied are to be regarded as not being the goods ordered in a much
                            more general sense. Here the cases have stressed, and hence required, a
                            more considerable discrepancy; though it should be noted that their
                            context is often that of holding an exemption clause inapplicable where
                            the goods supplied are of a different kind. Thus a contract for common
                            English sainfoin seed was not performed by delivery of giant sainfoin; a
                            contract for a new Singer car was not satisfied by delivery of a
                            second-hand model; a contract for a second-hand reaping machine new the
                            previous year, and only used to cut 50 acres, was not performed by
                            delivery of a very old one which had been mended. Consumer cases are
                            more likely to figure in this group than in the first. Thus it has been
                            held that a contract for a “Herald, convertible, white, 1961,
                            twin carbs.” was not performed by delivery of a vehicle
                            consisting of parts of two cars, one part manufactured earlier than
                            1961, welded together. In a New Zealand case, it was held that a
                            contract to sell a pure bred polled Angus bull could be treated as
                            discharged for breach when the bull (which had been inspected and bought
                            at an auction) proved to be “a bull in name only and useful as
                            such for no purpose, though its carcase may be of
                        value”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is also apposite at this juncture to refer
                    to the <em>de minimis</em> rule that qualifies the strict
                    application of s 13. The rule has been statutorily enshrined in s 15A
                    of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Modification of remedies for breach of
                            condition in non-consumer cases</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15A</b>. —(1) Where in the
                        case of a contract of sale —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)  the buyer would, apart from this subsection, have the right
                        to reject goods by reason of a breach on the part of the seller of a
                        condition implied by section 13, 14 or 15; but</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)  the breach is so slight that it would be unreasonable for
                        the buyer to reject them,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if the buyer does not deal as consumer, the breach is not to be
                        treated as a breach of condition but may be treated as a breach of
                        warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) This section applies unless a contrary intention appears in,
                        or is to be implied from, the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) It is for the seller to show that a breach fell within
                            subsection (1)(<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">What this provision seeks to do is to limit the right to reject goods
                    for breach of condition in non-consumer cases where the breach is slight and/or
                    technical. As observed in <em>Benjamin’s Sale of
                        Goods</em> at para 12-025:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly the new section only applies to breaches of the <em>implied</em> terms as to description, quality, fitness
                        for purpose and conformity with sample laid down in ss.13, 14 and 15 of the
                        Act. It does not apply to <em>express</em> terms,
                            <em>e.g</em>. as to time; and it is furthermore
                        excluded by express or implied contrary intention ... Where the term is not
                        a condition or a warranty but an intermediate or an innominate term the test
                        for treating the contract as discharged will remain the “nature and
                        consequences” test, which may bar doing so though the breach is more
                        than “slight”. Its main application is likely to be in
                        connection with s.13, under which conformity with description is an implied
                        condition, thus triggering off s.15A, and where cases lay down a strict duty
                        regarding such conformity. It will at any rate initially create
                        uncertainties in the law, though the provision that the burden of proof is
                        on the seller to establish that the exception applies will help in resolving
                        these. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We now turn to each of the arguments mounted
                    by Mr Hee in support of the contention that the Respondent had breached a
                    s 13 condition. Of these, only a few were apparently persuasive, and it is
                    to these that our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Discrepancy in length of the Drilling Machine </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is an objective and, more importantly,
                    undisputed fact that the Drill Contract referred to the length of the Drilling
                    Machine as <em>11 </em>metres, whereas the Drilling
                    Machine that was in fact supplied was <em>13.5 </em>metres in length (the stipulation as to length, we might
                    add, is, in our view, an integral and important ingredient of the identity of
                    the Drilling Machine under the Drill Contract). Hence, there was <em>prima facie</em> a breach by the Respondent of a condition
                    under s 13, which, as explained above, would entitle the Appellant to
                    succeed in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Respondent sought, in this regard, to
                    argue that this discrepancy in length made no difference in so far as the
                    operation of the Drilling Machine was concerned and that the Appellant’s
                    workshop could easily accommodate a machine that was 13.5 metres in
                        length.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Indeed, from a technical
                    perspective it would appear that the Drilling Machine had to be 13.5 metres
                    in length in order for it to be able to carry out the Appellant’s
                    stipulated requirement of boring up to 4 metres in depth (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> However, such an argument
                    is, in our view, legally irrelevant in the context of the present appeal. If the
                        <em>Hongkong Fir</em> approach were applicable, then
                    the argument might have had more traction since the Respondent could then argue
                    that this particular breach had not deprived the Appellant of substantially the
                    whole benefit of the contract it was intended the latter should have. However,
                    this is not the legal situation that is before this court. The contractual term
                    specifying the length of the Drilling Machine is, as already noted, a <em>condition</em> and any breach of it, regardless of the
                    consequences, entitles the Appellant to elect to treat the Drill Contract as
                    discharged (see also the position at common law pursuant to the legal principles
                    set out in <em>RDC Concrete</em> at [97]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It should also be noted that this was
                        <em>not</em> a situation where the <em>de minimis</em> principle operated. In particular, the
                    difference in the length of the Drilling Machine was some <em>2.5 </em>metres (or approximately <em>8.2 feet</em>). This was by no means a discrepancy that was
                    merely <em>de minimis</em> in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We note that the Respondent had also sought to
                    argue that the length of 11 metres was not a “description”
                    within the meaning of s 13 as the only specification allegedly sought by
                    the Appellant was that the Drilling Machine have a boring depth of
                    4 metres. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> We are unable to accept this
                    argument as the Drill Contract itself clearly describes the Drilling
                    Machine as having a length of 11 metres.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, the Respondent had a second string to
                    its legal bow. Mr Chooi argued that, in any event, the Appellant <em>knew</em> of the discrepancy in length and had, therefore,
                        <em>waived</em> its right to rely upon the breach as
                    entitling it to treat the Drill Contract as discharged.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The relevant
                    provision here is s 11(1) of the Act which states as follows:</p>

                        contract of sale is subject to a condition to be fulfilled by the

                        may elect to treat the breach of the condition as a breach of warranty
                        and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In making this submission, Mr Chooi
                    relied heavily on [17] of the Judgment
                    where the Judge states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff next averred that in the Drill Contract specification, the
                        Drilling Machine was described as 11m long, but the delivered Drilling
                        Machine was 13.5m long. Sometime in March 2008, the defendant provided the
                        plaintiff with a copy of the first foundation drawing for the defendant to
                        prepare the floor base for the Drilling Machine. This first foundation
                        drawing revealed that the length of the Drilling Machine was 13.5m rather
                        than 11 metres. <em>From this, the defendant discovered
                            that they had made an error in the Drill Contract where they had
                            inserted a length of 11m. By way of correction, the defendant then told
                            the plaintiff of this error</em>. <em>The
                            defendant’s evidence</em> is <em>that the
                            plaintiff then proceeded to measure the floor space of the Factory and
                            told the defendant that there was more than enough space to accommodate
                            the Drilling Machine</em>. <em>The plaintiff denied
                            that the defendant had pointed out this error to him based on the first
                            foundation plan although he admits having received it</em>. He
                        also denied having measured the floor space and telling the defendant that
                        there was space to accommodate the 13.5m-long Drilling Machine. <b><em>In any event</em></b><em>, it is undisputed
                            that the Factory floor space can accommodate the Drill Machine of
                            13.5m</em>. <em>The plaintiff proceeded to propose
                            amendments to the foundation plans to relocate the floor
                        base</em>. He then proceeded to prepare the floor base. <em>Finally, upon delivery of the Drilling Machine, he accepted the
                            delivery and installation of the Drilling Machine</em>. <b><em>In these circumstances I find that he had by conduct signified
                            his knowledge of the correct length of the Drilling Machine and his
                            agreement to the correction</em></b>. [emphasis added in italics and
                        bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At this juncture, some preliminary
                    observations with respect to the Judge’s analysis ought to be made.
                    Firstly, we note that the fact that the Factory floor space was sufficient to
                    accommodate the Drilling Machine is not, in and of itself, relevant to the issue
                    of waiver. This is because it does not impact any of the key elements of waiver
                    that had to be established by the Respondent, <em>viz</em>,
                    knowledge by the Appellant coupled with his acceptance of the Drilling Machine
                    of increased length. The Judge himself appeared to acknowledge this, as seen by
                    his conclusion on this issue (highlighted in bold italics in the paragraph cited
                    above). Yet, it still appears that he relied on the Factory floor space being
                    large enough to accommodate the Drilling Machine when arriving at his decision
                        (<em>cf</em> his use of the phrase “[i]n any
                    event”, above). If that were the case, then his decision on this issue of
                    waiver would, with respect, be undermined to a very significant
                extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Secondly, the mere acceptance of delivery of
                    the Drilling Machine <em>per se</em> could not, in our
                    view, constitute waiver on the part of the Appellant. There must still be
                    knowledge by the Appellant of the breach of contract that coincides with his
                    acceptance of delivery. Unfortunately, how and when this knowledge arises is not
                    clear from the Judge’s analysis. In fact, in our view, based on the
                    evidence before us, it would appear that the Appellant had no such knowledge at
                    all, as the Drilling Machine was received by <em>his
                        employee</em> from the Respondent. All the Appellant did was to
                    initial acknowledgement of receipt. This was followed shortly thereafter by his
                    rejection after he discovered the breach (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>–<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Thirdly, although the Respondent emphasised in
                    the court below that the Appellant must have had knowledge because the former
                    had <em>communicated directly</em> to the latter the
                    discrepancy in length through its representative, we believe that it is
                    significant that the Judge chose to focus instead on the Respondent’s
                        <em>other</em> main plank of argument, <em>viz</em>, that the Appellant had waived his rights to rescind
                    the Drill Contract based on the discrepancy in the length of the Drilling
                    Machine, as a result of conduct which “signified his knowledge of the
                    correct length of the Drilling Machine and his agreement to the
                    correction” (see the Judgment at [17], quoted above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>).
                    Also, we note that the Judge, in his analysis, merely <em>describes</em> both parties’ arguments and makes no clear
                    finding of fact as to whether there was such direct communication between
                    parties. We would also add that the testimony that Mr Chooi referred us to
                    (which was also mentioned in the trial below),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in support
                    of the Respondent’s argument in relation to this point of direct
                    communication, is, in itself, ambiguous at best.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At this particular juncture, it bears
                    observing that the law on waiver is a complex concept, not least because the
                    term has been used by the courts in different senses. A useful summary of the
                    law on waiver may be found in the following observations by Lord Goff of
                    Chieveley in the House of Lords decision in <em>The
                        Kanchenjunga</em> [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 391 at
                    397–399:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a commonplace that the expression “waiver” is one
                        which may, in law, bear different meanings. In particular, it may refer to a
                        forbearance from exercising a right or to an abandonment of a right. Here we
                        are concerned with waiver in the sense of abandonment of a right which
                        arises by virtue of a party making an election …. In all
                        cases he [the innocent party] has in the end to make his election not as a
                        matter of obligation, but in the sense that, if he does not do so, the time
                        may come when the law takes the decision out of his hands, either by holding
                        him to have elected not to exercise the right ... or sometimes by
                        holding him to have elected to exercise it. ... But of course an
                        election need not be made in this way. It can be communicated to the other
                        party by words or conduct; though, perhaps because a party who elects not to
                        exercise a right which has become available to him is abandoning that right,
                        he will only be held to have done so if he has so communicated his election
                        to the other party in clear and unequivocal terms ... Moreover it
                        does not require consideration to support it, and so it is to be
                        distinguished from an express or implied agreement, such as a variation of
                        the relevant contract, which traditionally requires consideration to render
                        it binding in English law… generally, ... it is a
                        prerequisite of election that the party making the election must be aware of
                        the facts which have given rise to the existence of his new
                        right … I add in parenthesis that, for present purposes, it
                        is not necessary for me to consider certain cases in which it has been held
                        that, as a prerequisite of election, the party must be aware not only of the
                        facts giving rise to his rights but also of the rights themselves, because
                        it is not in dispute here that the owners were aware both of the relevant
                        facts and of their relevant rights. ... Election is to be contrasted
                        with equitable estoppel, a principle associated with the leading case of
                            <em>Hughes v</em>. <em>Metropolitan
                            Railway Co</em> [(1877) 2 App Cas 439] ... There is
                        an important similarity between the two principles, election and equitable
                        estoppel, in that each requires an unequivocal representation, perhaps
                        because each may involve a loss, permanent or temporary, of the relevant
                        party’s rights. But there are important differences as well. In the
                        context of a contract, the principle of election applies when a state of
                        affairs comes into existence in which one party becomes entitled to exercise
                        a right, and has to choose whether to exercise the right or not. His
                        election has generally to be an informed choice, made with knowledge of the
                        facts giving rise to the right. His election once made is final; it is not
                        dependent upon reliance on it by the other party. On the other hand,
                        equitable estoppel requires an unequivocal representation by one party that
                        he will not insist upon his legal rights against the other party, and such
                        reliance by the representee as will render it inequitable for the
                        representor to go back upon his representation. No question arises of any
                        particular knowledge on the part of the representor, and the estoppel may be
                        suspensory only. Furthermore, the representation itself is different in
                        character in the two cases. The party making his election is communicating
                        his choice whether or not to exercise a right which has become available to
                        him. The party to an equitable estoppel is representing that he will not in
                        future enforce his legal rights. His representation is therefore in the
                        nature of a promise which, though unsupported by consideration, can have
                        legal consequences; hence it is sometimes referred to as promissory
                        estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For more details, reference in this regard may also be made to the
                    High Court of Australia decision of <em>Sargent v ASL
                        Developments Limited</em> [1974] 131 CLR 634 especially at
                    641–642 (which was cited by this court in <em>Ang Sin Hock
                        v Khoo Eng Lim</em> [2010] 3 SLR 179 at [30]), as well as to the very helpful article
                    by Professor Carter (see J W Carter, “Waiver (of Contractual
                    Rights) Distributed” (1991) 4 JCL 59).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Applying the concept of waiver to the facts of
                    the present appeal, it is clear that the focus of the parties was on the issue
                    of <em>election</em> as opposed to <em>estoppel</em> (hence, the corresponding focus on the issue of the
                    Appellant’s knowledge). As to what knowledge is relevant, it would appear
                    that the party waiving his right should at least have knowledge of the facts
                    giving rise to those rights. (Note, however another view espoused in <em>Peyman v Lanjani</em> [1985] 2 WLR 154, that there
                    must be knowledge of the <em>existence</em> of contractual
                    rights themselves, at least in so far as they are express contractual rights,
                    though this decision has been critiqued by The Hon Mr Justice K R
                    Handley, in <em>Estoppel by Conduct and Election</em>
                    (Thomson/Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006), especially at para 14-015).
                    Accordingly, the burden is on the Respondent to furnish clear and objective
                    evidence to demonstrate that the Appellant did, in fact, have knowledge
                        <em>that the Drilling Machine was 13.5 metres instead of
                        11 metres</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In addition to his reliance on [17] of the Judgment (see above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), the Respondent also proffered a number of
                    specific arguments in an attempt to establish the existence of such knowledge
                    (some of which were, not surprisingly, related to [17] of the Judgment). In this regard, his first argument was
                    that that the First Drawing which the Appellant had viewed (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) clearly illustrated the actual length of
                    the Drilling Machine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In our view, this
                    cannot be the case. The drawing in itself was not at all clear (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). Indeed, the Appellant would have had to
                    study the drawing in some detail and analyse the various distances with
                    reference to a table in order to work out the actual length of the Drilling
                    Machine. This is a far cry from the drawing itself stating clearly what the
                    length of the Drilling Machine is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the Respondent’s second argument, it
                    reiterated its position in the court below that the Appellant had to have had
                    the requisite knowledge since the Respondent’s representative had
                    communicated the discrepancy to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As noted above (at
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>), we do not find this argument
                    persuasive. More specifically, however, there was one further (and related)
                    argument which needs to be considered, <em>viz</em>, the
                    Respondent’s claim that it had only realised there was an error in the
                    stipulation of the length of the Drilling Machine in the Drill Contract when it
                    received the First Drawing. Assuming that this was indeed the case, and bearing
                    in mind the fact that the Respondent was the vendor of the Drilling Machine, we
                    would have thought that the Respondent should have conveyed this error to the
                    Appellant immediately <em>in writing</em>. An oral
                    communication of such an important condition of the contract, would, in these
                    circumstances be insufficient even if, as Mr Chooi asserted, the Respondent
                    and the Appellant were in the practice of dealing informally with each other. As
                    noted above at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>, the specification as to
                    length of the Drilling Machine forms an important term of the Drill Contract.
                    Any deviation from the description thereby warrants notification in writing to
                    ensure that the Appellant’s attention is directed to the
                error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In his third argument on the issue of
                    knowledge, Mr Chooi focused on the Judge’s observations that the
                    Appellant had “proceeded to propose amendments to the foundation plans to
                    relocate the floor base” and that the Appellant had “then
                    proceeded to prepare the floor base” (see the Judgment at [17], reproduced above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>). Such preparation included marking out on
                    the floor the locations of the holes that would have to be dug in order to
                    install the Drilling Machine. This, Mr Chooi argued, demonstrated that the
                    Appellant was aware that the actual length of the Drilling Machine was
                        13.5 metres.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, in our
                    view, this argument is, with respect, neither here nor there as the markings
                    could have equally been made on the premise that the Drilling Machine was
                    11 metres in length.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At this point, we pause to note that it was
                    not clear whether the Judge, at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> of the
                    Judgment, was making reference to preparation of the floor base for the purposes
                    of <em>installation of the Drilling Machine into the Factory
                        Floor</em>, or to preparation work specifically relating to the
                        <em>oil tank</em> used to run the Drilling Machine,
                    which also involved digging a small cavity in the floor for its installation.
                    If, however, the Judge was referring to the latter and not the former, we would
                    note that it was not disputed by parties that the Appellant had wanted to
                    re-position the customised oil tank (which was two metres in length) from
                    beside the Drilling Machine to in front of it (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>). Such a repositioning would have necessitated
                    an increase in the overall length of space required to accommodate all the
                    equipment (<em>viz</em>, the customised oil tank and the
                    Drilling Machine) as an integrated whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On this point, Mr Chooi sought to argue
                    that the Appellant would have to study the First Drawing to ensure there was
                    sufficient space in the Factory to accommodate the change. In so doing, he must
                    have discovered the actual length of the Drilling Machine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> We find this argument
                    to be tenuous. As stated above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>, the
                    diagram was not easy to understand. We also accept as plausible the
                    Appellant’s counterargument to the effect that he proposed the
                    repositioning operating on the assumption that the machine was 11 metres
                    and not 13.5 metres. In a contract for the sale of goods by description,
                    the purchaser is entitled to rely on the specifications set out in the relevant
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the final analysis, having carefully
                    considered all the relevant evidence, it appears that, whilst the
                    Respondent’s version of events with regard to this particular issue is by
                    no means untenable, the Appellant’s (contrary) version of events is
                        <em>at least equally probable</em>. In the
                    circumstances, we find that the Respondent has not been able to discharge its
                    burden of proof with respect to this particular aspect of its case and therefore
                    hold that the Appellant had <em>not</em> waived its rights
                    in respect of the Respondent’s breach of the condition in the Drill
                    Contract with regard to the length of the Drilling Machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether or not the Drilling Machine had been refurbished</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In light of our reasoning above, we find it
                    unnecessary to embark on an analysis of Mr Hee’s second argument that
                    pertains to whether or not the Drilling Machine was refurbished. However, we
                    will pause to note in passing that if this question were to be answered in the
                    positive, then the Respondent would be in breach of the Drill Contract for
                    failure to deliver a new machine which was contemplated by the parties to the
                    sale and purchase contract given the strict nature of a condition (here,
                    pursuant to s 13).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inspection by the Appellant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, we note, albeit only in passing, that
                    there was at least one other issue that could have been – but was not
                    – raised by the Appellant. This was the requirement that the Drilling
                    Machine be inspected by the Appellant at the manufacturer’s plant, which
                    inspection never took place (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above).
                    We would have thought that, in the nature of things, such a term would be a
                        <em>condition</em> of the contract, the breach of which
                    would have entitled the Appellant to rescind the contract. However, as the
                    Appellant has not pursued this point, we say no more about it. In any event,
                    even if the argument had been raised successfully, it would have made no
                    difference to the result of the present appeal in light of our findings
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed in
                    part inasmuch as it relates to the Respondent’s breach of the Drill
                    Contract. The Appellant is thus entitled to refunds of the sums paid in respect
                    of the Drilling Machine and damages for their losses suffered due to the breach.
                    In this regard, the matter is remitted to the Judge to determine the precise
                    sums to be awarded. However, the appeal fails in so far as the Appellant’s
                    claim for breaches of the Lathe Machine Contract is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, each party is to bear its own costs
                    both here as well as in the court below. There will be the usual consequential
                    orders.</p>
