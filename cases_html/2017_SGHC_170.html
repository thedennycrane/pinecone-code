This is an offence that may be punished with a fine, or with up to five years’ imprisonment, or with both. The Appellant was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment by the DJ, whose grounds of decision can be found at <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Keeping Mark John </span>[2016] SGDC 344 (“the GD”). The Appellant appealed against the DJ’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On appeal, the Prosecution argued before me that a term of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the Appellant, and was also a “fair starting point” for an offence under s 419 of the PC (a “s 419 offence”) committed pursuant to a scheme by a syndicate to smuggle a person into or out of Singapore by air.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At this juncture, I would like just to touch briefly on a matter of terminology. It seems to me that the term “starting point” may not be entirely appropriate, and that the term “benchmark sentence” may well be preferable. As the Court of Appeal recently explained in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGCA 37, which had yet to be issued at the time this appeal was heard, the starting point approach “calls for the identification of a notional starting point which will then be adjusted taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case” (at [27]). It is generally used for regulatory offences (at [28]). The benchmark approach, on the other hand, “calls for the identification of an archetypal case (or a series of archetypal cases) and the sentence which should be imposed in respect of such a case” (at [31]). It is “particularly suited for offences which overwhelmingly manifest in a particular way or where a particular variant or manner of offending is extremely common and is therefore singled out for special attention” (at [32]). In the present case, what I was addressing was a sentencing guideline for s 419 offences committed in the context of people smuggling by syndicates, whether transnational or local. Given this degree of specificity, it seems to me that “benchmark sentence” would be the more appropriate term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On the substance of the Prosecution’s arguments, having regard to the relevant precedents, I disagreed that the benchmark sentence for a s 419 offence should be 12 months’ imprisonment. Instead, in my view, the benchmark sentence ought to be four to six months’ imprisonment. Accordingly, I found the sentence imposed on the Appellant manifestly excessive. Given that the Appellant had, by the date of the hearing before me, effectively served a nine-month imprisonment sentence, taking into account remission, I held that he could be released forthwith. As the Appellant indicated that he was amenable to being released only “tomorrow morning” as opposed to on the same afternoon that the appeal was heard, I ordered his release on the morning of the following day, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 16 March 2017. I now set out the grounds for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The background to this case was set out in detail by the DJ at [5]–[13] and [25]–[30] of the GD. As the facts were undisputed, I will only give a brief summary of the material facts, which are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Appellant is a 45-year-old British national. He was recruited by a people smuggling syndicate to assist in facilitating the illegal entry of their customers into another country. The customer in the present case was one Vigneshwararaja Kajanan (“Kajanan”), a Sri Lankan national. Kajanan had paid the syndicate to facilitate his entry (and migration) to Auckland, New Zealand. The Appellant’s role in the scheme was to check in for a flight to Auckland which had been booked in his own name. After having done so and having received his boarding pass, he handed it to Kajanan, who then used the boarding pass and a forged passport in an attempt to board the flight to Auckland. The Appellant received US$600 for his role in this scheme.

</div> The Prosecution emphasised, in particular, two significant developments which had occurred since the precedents were decided. First, terrorism had emerged as a major security concern and had been linked to people smuggling. Second, Parliament had amended the law to enhance the maximum penalty prescribed for s 419 offences. In addition, the Prosecution maintained its argument that the Passport Cases were still germane to s 419 offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I will begin by discussing the appropriate benchmark sentence for s 419 offences committed in the context of people smuggling, before applying it to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate benchmark sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In determining the appropriate benchmark sentence for s 419 offences that are committed in the context of people smuggling, it is important to first consider the relevant precedents decided under s 419 of the PC itself.

The case is summarised in <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice</span>”) at pp 855–856 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Offender pleaded guilty to two counts of abetment of conspiracy to cheat by personation under s 419 and one count of cheating under s 420. A similar charge of s 420 was taken into consideration. The offender had been recruited into a syndicate smuggling alien nationals. On her part, she recruited another member into the syndicate. The role of the offender was to escort nationals from China into Japan using forged Singapore international passports. For the first charge, the offender was involved in a conspiracy to provide a Chinese national with a Singapore passport to gain entry to Japan. The second charge alleged that the offender conspired to cheat an airline official into allowing the Chinese national to board a United Airlines flight by using a boarding pass which had been issued to another person. For the third charge, the offender cheated the immigration authorities by inducing them to issue a new passport by making a false representation that her godson had scribbled in her passport and had damaged it. In fact, she had destroyed her old passport to remove evidence of her smuggling trips. The fourth charge which was taken into consideration was similar to the third charge. In mitigation, it was said that the offender was of poor health. The District Judge felt that the overwhelming consideration was that of public policy which required a severe sentence to deter criminals from using Singapore as a transit point to smuggle aliens.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence imposed by the trial court</span>: One year’s imprisonment each on the s 419 charges and two years’ imprisonment on the s 420 charge.

The district judge in that case sentenced the two offenders to a fine of $4,000 each.

However, the evidence linking people smuggling to safety threats and terrorism is rather thin. The problem of people smuggling has been around for some time, as the cases of <span class="font-italic">Yong Siew </span><span class="font-italic">Soon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chua Bee Lay</span> show.

Kajanan, the person who attempted to travel to Auckland using the Appellant’s boarding pass, was simply trying to migrate to New Zealand to seek a better life.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is true that the maximum sentence prescribed for an offence is generally indicative of its seriousness. It also follows that an increase in the maximum sentence for an offence is an indication that Parliament intended that the offence should thereafter attract heavier sentences, and the courts should reflect that intention in their sentencing decisions. However, such a change does not automatically have a conclusive effect, especially when Parliament states otherwise (see Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2009) at paras 5.008–5.010). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In the present case, while I thought <span class="font-italic">some</span> weight should be given to the increase in the maximum sentence for s 419 offences, the weight to be given had to be moderated in the light of the relevant Parliamentary speeches during the second reading of the Bill proposing this amendment (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007 (Bill 38 of 2007) (“the Bill”)). The increase in the maximum sentence for s 419 offences was undertaken when Parliament conducted a broad review of the 1985 edition of the PC and changed the sentences for many offences. However, Parliament did not intend to effect a general increase in the sentences for all affected offences. As Senior Minister of State Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee (“Assoc Prof Ho”) explained during the second reading of the Bill in October 2007 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary </span><span class="font-italic">Debates, Official Report </span>(23 October 2007) vol 83 at cols 2439–2440):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… when Mr Lim Biow Chuan asks whether what we have done will lead automatically to fines or punishments going up[,] I do not think so. He has mentioned, for example, the benchmarks, the sentencing guidelines, that the courts have. <span class="font-italic">I think the guidelines will continue.</span> It does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up. Because every punishment must depend on the facts of the case. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Thus, Assoc Prof Ho made it clear that existing sentencing guidelines need not be changed and could continue. Accordingly, I was of the view that the increase in the maximum sentence prescribed in s 419 of the PC could not, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, justify a significant increase in the sentence for an offence under that section.

The reservations which I expressed earlier (at [18] above) as to the precedential value of unreported cases applied with equal force here. Even more pertinently, it was questionable how relevant the Passport Cases were, given that the Appellant had been charged under a <span class="font-italic">different </span>provision, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 419 of the PC. As stated by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Luong </span><span class="font-italic">Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 1 SLR 707 (“<span class="font-italic">Luong</span>”) at [14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In assessing the value of sentencing precedents based on an offence <span class="font-italic">different</span> from that for which the court is to pass sentence, care must be taken to ensure that the two offences (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the offence which is the subject matter of the sentencing precedents and the offence for which the court is to pass sentence), although different, are still analogous in terms of both policy and punishment. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The offence under s 47(6) of the PA is not analogous to the offence under s 419 of the PC in terms of both policy and punishment.

In terms of policy, it seems clear to me that there is a significant difference in criminal activity involving <span class="font-italic">boarding passes </span>as opposed to <span class="font-italic">passports</span>. While it is true, as the Prosecution submitted, that a fake passport alone is useless for travel if there is no matching boarding pass, it remains the case that a fake passport would cause much more harm than a fake boarding pass (or a boarding pass used in an unlawful manner). A fake boarding pass can only facilitate one journey; a fake passport can facilitate many more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The difference in policy behind s 47 of the PA and s 419 of the PC was considered by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Luong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in relation to s 47(3) of the PA. The accused in <span class="font-italic">Luong </span>was convicted of two charges under s 47(3) of the PA in the District Court. On appeal, she argued that the district judge had erred in failing to consider sentencing precedents for the offence under s 419 of the PC. The High Court rejected this submission. It noted that Parliament’s intention in enacting the PA was “to enact a consolidated statute to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, arrest the increased misuse of both Singapore passports and foreign travel documents by criminal and terrorist elements to facilitate their movement between countries” (at [13]). Section 419 of the PC, on the other hand, had not been enacted for the same purpose (at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The High Court held that “sentencing precedents for other unrelated offences would be of limited guidance in prosecutions for the offence under s 47(3) of [the PA]” (at [14]).

Despite his protest that he was not part of a people smuggling syndicate, it was beyond doubt that the Appellant’s crime was indeed committed as part of the operations of a transnational syndicate. It would be different if Kajanan, the primary offender, had approached the Appellant personally asking for help to travel to Auckland. That said, in fairness to the Appellant, it was clear – as accepted by the Prosecution – that the Appellant occupied a position among the lower echelons of the syndicate.

However, as the Appellant’s offence was perpetrated by a transnational syndicate, and one in which the Appellant was very much involved at that, a sentence at the higher end of the benchmark range was warranted. In this regard, the Prosecution suggested that the two offenders in <span class="font-italic">Janet Ng</span> were “at most, part of a local syndicate” as opposed to “a sophisticated transnational people smuggling syndicate”.

The sentences for both charges were ordered to run concurrently, making a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As explained above at [35]–[36], an offence under s 47(6) of the PA is more serious than one under s 419 of the PC. Thus, applying the principle of parity, the Appellant’s sentence was manifestly excessive as he received the same sentence as Kajanan, who had committed the more serious offence under s 47(6) of the PA (in addition to the offence under s 419 of the PC). Indeed, based on the principle of parity, Kajanan’s sentence for his s 419 offence should also be considered manifestly excessive. However, as his two sentences had been ordered to run concurrently, there was no need for me to exercise my powers of criminal revision to revise his sentence in relation to his charge under s 419 of the PC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the reasons above, I found that the 12-month imprisonment sentence imposed by the DJ on the Appellant was manifestly excessive. I was disappointed and also troubled by the fact that the appropriate precedents were not cited to the DJ at the time she sentenced the Appellant. She was instead referred to precedents that were not quite on point, resulting in a sentence that was manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Taking into account remission, by the time this appeal was heard before me, the Appellant had already effectively served a nine-month imprisonment term. I therefore ordered that he be released forthwith, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on the morning of 16 March 2017 (see [4] above). </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin<br/>Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Appellant in person;<br/>Nathaniel Khng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
