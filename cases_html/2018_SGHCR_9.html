D &amp; E say that this amounts to consent by the signatories to extending the arbitration agreement to D &amp; E as Affiliates. It is submitted that this intention is supported by the holistic reading of numerous sections of the IA, including clause 11.4 (below) and clause 29.2 (which contains the arbitration agreement). The concomitant consent of D &amp; E is said to be evident by their conduct in making this stay application. Reliance is placed on <span class="font-italic">The Titan Unity </span>[2014] SGHCR 4 at [35] for this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">The Titan Unity</span>, the plaintiff (“Portigon”) provided financing to Onsys Energy Pte Ltd (“Onsys”) for the purchase of fuel oil. As the holder of bills of lading, Portigon commenced a claim for misdelivery against the 1st defendant demise charterer (“Oceanic”) and the second defendant shipowner (“Singapore Tanker”) on the basis that both were the carriers and persons in physical possession of the cargo. Singapore Tanker applied to set aside and strike out the action by Portigon and the Assistant Registrar considered the question of whether the court should order Singapore Tanker to be joined to the arbitration proceedings between Portigon and Oceanic. The court reviewed Singapore as well as foreign cases and came to the conclusion at [35] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cases above illustrate the principle that where the objective circumstances and parties’ conduct reveal that the parties to the arbitration agreement have consented to extend the agreement to a third person who is not a party to the agreement, and that third party has shown by its conduct to accept to be bound by the agreement, parties can be found to have impliedly consented to form an agreement to arbitrate where this has been clearly and unequivocally shown to be the parties’ objective intention.  …  In particular, implied consent is determined from the parties’ intention to extend the written arbitration agreement to a non-party who accepts to be bound by it… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Bearing the above principle in mind, I turn to consider whether there is any objective circumstance and conduct which show the parties to the arbitration agreement in the IA have consented to extend this agreement to D &amp; E. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Clauses of the Investment Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 D &amp; E submit that the objective intention to extend the arbitration agreement is supported by the holistic reading of various clauses of the IA. Though a number of clauses of the IA were cited in D &amp; E’s supplemental submissions, I will focus on clause 11.4 and clause 29.2 as these were the two main clauses which D &amp; E relied on during their main submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Clause 11.4 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 D &amp; E submit that it is apparent from Clause 11.4 of the IA that the parties specifically contemplated that claims made by A co and its subsidiaries against either (i) G co and its Affiliates, or (ii) F co and its Affiliates, would be prosecuted by the respective nominee directors. D &amp; E fall within the definition of G co’s Affiliates. Since this is an action by A co against D &amp; E, who are G co’s Affiliates, clause 11.4 applies to this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Clause 11.4 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.4  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Articles of Association, any right of action which [A co] or [any subsidiary of A co] may have against (a) [F co] (or any of its Affiliates) shall be prosecuted on behalf of [A co] solely by [G co Directors], and (b) G co (or any of its Affiliates) shall be prosecuted on behalf of [A co] solely by [F co Directors], including any such right of action which may arise under or pursuant to any Transaction Document. In such event, the [G co Directors] or [F co Directors] (as the case may be) shall have full authority on behalf of [A co] to negotiate, litigate and settle any claim arising out of such right of action or in the case a right of action by [any subsidiary of A co], to exercise the rights and powers as a direct or indirect shareholder of such [subsidiary of A co] to negotiate, litigate and settle any claim arising out of such right of action….</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 D &amp; E submitted that clause 11 of the IA is the “bedrock” of this present Suit 102 and is the “main point” of their present application for a stay under section 6 of the IAA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In their supplemental submissions filed on 23 May 2018, D &amp; E’s counsel went on to state that  clause 11.4 is “a unique clause which makes the case for holding that D &amp; E are parties to the [a]rbitration [a]greement even stronger than all the cases cited during the hearings of [this Summons].”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 D &amp; E claim that the subject matter of this entire Suit 102 revolves around related party transactions as the complaint is that D &amp; E have acted in breach of their fiduciary duties in allowing A co to enter into related party transaction without the consent of both G co and F co. Related party transactions were originally governed by clause 11.1/11.2 read with paragraph 10 of schedule 7 of the IA and the IA governs the standard as to whether a related party transaction has been properly entered into and so the entire scope of the complaints in this action revolve around whether the controls in the IA have been observed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 With respect to D &amp; E, I find their submissions totally unmeritorious. In my view, the purpose of clause 11.4 is to state clearly that the F co directors have control of any proceedings which are initiated by A co against the affiliates of A co, including D &amp; E. This clause provides legitimacy to any decision made solely by the F co directors in such proceedings, and ensures there is no challenge to any decision made by them on the basis that such a decision is not made with the authority of the Board of Directors of A co. In other words, this is merely a clause which provides which members of the Board of Directors of A co have “control” of the proceedings by A co. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The effect of Clause 11.4 is that, as in this present Suit 102. where A co has a right of action against D &amp; E, who are affiliates of G co, the suit will be prosecuted on behalf of A co solely by the F co directors who shall have “full authority on behalf of [A co] to negotiate, litigate and settled any claim arising out of such right of action”. There is nothing in this clause which indicate or reveal in any way that the signatories to the IA consented to or had the intention to extend the arbitration agreement contained in the IA to Affiliates of G co. Apart from submissions on the interpretation of Clause 11.4, D &amp; E have provided no objective circumstances or conduct by parties to support the D &amp; E’s position that the signatories to the IA intended to extend the arbitration agreement through this clause to D &amp; E.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Clause 29.2 : The arbitration agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 D &amp; E submitted that the express wording of the arbitration agreement in clause 29.2 demonstrates a clear intention by all parties for any matter “arising out of or in connection with” the IA to be resolved by arbitration:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29.2 Any dispute, controversy or conflict arising out of or in connection with this Agreement including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination (a "Dispute"), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore and administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (the "SIAC") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC for the time being in force which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause 29.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Companies’ solicitors disagree. They submit that if the parties had intended the arbitration agreement to apply to any matter which arises from the IA, then they would have stated so expressly. They refer to the Deed of Adherence which is at schedule 13 of the IA where there was an express incorporation of the arbitration agreement. It was submitted that this shows that parties had applied their mind to when they wished to incorporate the arbitration agreement and have specifically stated when it is to apply. As such, if it was the parties’ intention that the arbitration agreement was to apply to any matter concerning the disputes in this action, this would have been specifically provided by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I agree with the Companies. The objective circumstances and parties conduct reveal that if parties wished to extend the arbitration agreement to the D &amp; E, they would have expressly provided for it as they have done in other agreements in the IA. The mere wording of the arbitration agreement would not be sufficient to imply that there was an intention that the arbitration agreement would apply to this present Suit 102 between A co and D &amp; E. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Therefore, for the above reasons, I am of the view that there is no objective intention or any agreement between the signatories to the arbitration agreement to extend this agreement to D &amp; E.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Can a non-party compel a party to the arbitration agreement to arbitrate?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Alternatively, D &amp; E submit that, though they are not parties to the arbitration agreement, they are entitled to compel the Companies to arbitrate given that the alleged wrongful acts in this action all arise from their behaviour or in their capacity as directors, who are agents of A co or as directors of H co and C co who are Group Companies which the Defendants say are both governed by A co and whose businesses are regulated by the IA.

The joint venture agreement contained an arbitration clause. The defendants are directors of PKB. They were also key officers of ProtoStar. The defendants were not party to the joint venture agreement. Shortly after the joint venture agreement was concluded, ProtoStar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Kiskadee Bermuda alleges that the defendants misrepresented ProtoStars’s financial condition to Kiskadee Bermuda and falsely represented that ProtoStar would be able to fulfil its obligations under the joint venture agreement.

Further, it is not persuasive authority because the legal test for stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration in the US is significantly broader than section 6 of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States <span class="font-underline">upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration</span>, the court in which such suit is pending, <span class="font-underline">upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement</span>, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceedings with such arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Companies point out that Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act does not require the party seeking the stay to be a party to the arbitration agreement in order for a stay of proceedings to be granted. All that is required is that there is an issue which may be referred to arbitration under the arbitration agreement. In contrast, in Singapore, section 6 of the IAA is only applicable when a party to an arbitration agreement seeks a stay of proceedings against any other party to the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Further, the Companies submit that <span class="font-italic">Kiskadee </span>may be distinguished on the facts.

The claim brought against the defendants pertained to their acts <span class="font-italic">qua </span>agents of ProtoStar in the process of forming the joint venture company. In contrast, in the present Suit 102, the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties arise from acts done by D &amp; E as directors of the Companies in relation to related party transactions.

It is disappointing that they failed to inform the Court that the “agency principle” has not been unanimously accepted by the US Courts. In <span class="font-italic">Gary Born</span>, the learned author observed at p 1479:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… some U.S. courts have permitted the officers and directors of a corporate party to invoke the arbitration clause in that party’s underlying commercial contracts, notwithstanding the fact that the individual officers, directors and employees are not parties to the underlying contract under ordinary contractual principles. In these circumstances, a number of U.S. decisions have held that corporate employees, sued for actions taken in the course of their employment, may invoke arbitration clauses contained in their employer’s contracts with the adverse third party. As one U.S. court reasoned, with a degree of overstatement, a company can only act through employees and officers, and “an arbitration agreement would be of little value if it did not extend to them.’”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">These decisions are not unanimously followed even in the United States</span>.

Having failed to do this, it insufficient for D &amp; E to simply refer to the US case of <span class="font-italic">Kiskadee </span>and invite this court to adopt the “agency principle” merely because it has been adopted in this US case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third party rights</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Clause 27.9 of the IA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27.9 Third party rights</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Except where expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, <span class="font-underline">a person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act to enforce any term of this Agreement, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exist or is available apart from the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act</span>.

The reference in the section to the term purporting to ‘confer’ a benefit seems to me to connote that the language used by the parties shows that one of the purpose of their bargain (rather than one of its incidental effects if performed) was to benefit the third party. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">277 This suggest that the English court was of the view that the distinction between the intended and the incidental beneficiaries applies to the first limb.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">278 This is logical. It is only when a third party establishes that it is an intended beneficiary of the contract that the burden then shifts, under the second limb, to the party giving the indemnity or warranty (“the Warranting Party”) to show that notwithstanding that the third party is an intended beneficiary, the parties to the contract did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 D &amp; E submitted that the inclusion of the arbitration agreement was not specifically targeted as a benefit for D &amp; E but was intended to be of general application for all disputes arising from or connected to the IA.

However, the Companies have pointed out that section 9(2)(a) read with section 2 of the CRPTA does provide that an arbitration agreement may be enforced by third parties under the IAA where the arbitration agreement is intended to benefit those third parties. In my view, it does appear that a third party’s right to enforce an arbitration agreement entered into under the IAA is a benefit which a third party may enforce under the CRPTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Since D &amp; E have stated they are not relying on any rights under the CRTPA, I do not have to come to any finding in relation to the CRTPA. However, it is noteworthy that the explanation given by D &amp; E as to the reason they chose not to rely on the CRTPA supports my earlier conclusion that the signatories to the IA did not intend to confer the benefit of the arbitration agreement in the IA on D &amp; E such that D &amp; E are entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement and seek a stay of the present Suit 102 in favour of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on section 6 of the IAA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In conclusion, I am of the view that D &amp; E are not parties to the arbitration agreement which is contained in the IA as:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is no objective intention between the signatories to the arbitration agreement to extend this agreement to D &amp; E; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The “agency principle” does not apply in Singapore and D &amp; E, as non-parties to the arbitration agreement, cannot compel the Companies to arbitrate the issues in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Therefore, as D &amp; E are not parties to the arbitration agreement in the IA, one of the conditions for stay of proceedings under section 6 of the IAA has not been satisfied and it is not necessary to proceed further to determine whether the dispute between parties is subject to the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Accordingly. for the reasons stated above, no stay of the present Suit 102 in favour of arbitration pursuant to section 6 of the IAA is granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I would add that there is dispute between the Companies and D &amp; E whether H co and C co, are parties to the IA and thus a party to the arbitration agreement.

It is D &amp; E’s submission that the main complaint in this action is that D &amp; E, as directors of A co, had entered into transactions without the approval of F co. This falls within clause 11 of the IA and the correct procedure would have been for F co to commence arbitration proceedings against G co and its affiliates under clause 11.4 of the IA. It is submitted that to avoid the arbitration clause, F co has instead commenced this action in the name of A co against D &amp; E. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Companies made preliminary submissions that the issue of arbitration and case management stay had already been argued in OS XD before Pang JC and, therefore, once leave had been granted to commence derivative action pursuant to section 216A of the Companies Act, there arose an issue estoppel or abuse of process (i.e. the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">Res Judicata</span>) which barred this stay application. In light of these submissions, the Companies were directed to seek clarification from Pang JC on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On 8 May 2018, Pang JC clarified as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The issue concerning arbitration arose in [OS XD] in the context of whether it was open to [F co] to bring a claim by way of arbitration <span class="font-underline">directly</span> against [D] and [E] and whether that would be sufficiently viable and adequate remedy for F co, so as to render it inappropriate or unnecessary for leave to be granted to F co under s 216A of the Companies Act to bring a derivative claim in the name and on behalf of [A co], [H co] and [C co].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Parties’ submissions in [OS XD] did not address whether the eventual derivative claim, if leave is to be granted under s 216A, should be brought by way of court proceedings or by way of arbitration. This was therefore not an issue which arose for decision by the Court in OS XD/2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Section 216A envisages that a derivative claim could be brought by way of court proceedings or by way of arbitration. In using the word “actions” in ORC XF/2018, the Court was merely adopting the language used by F co in the originating summons. The intention was simply to grant leave for the derivative claim to be brought and not to preclude any option which may be available for the pursuit of the derivative claim by way of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It is clear that, having considered parties’ submissions, leave was granted to commence a derivative action and that in this leave, Pang JC has clarified that the order did not preclude the option for the derivative action to be commenced by way of arbitration. Since leave has been granted to commence action in the name of the Companies who have the option of commencing the action by way of court proceedings or arbitration, I am of the view that any finding that the commencement of Suit 102 is an abuse of process would be a back-door appeal against Pang JC’s decision to grant leave to commence proceedings, be it by way of arbitral proceedings or proceedings in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In any event, I had earlier held that D &amp; E are not parties to any arbitration agreement with A co and are not entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement in the IA.

In ARB XA, F co claims that A co failed to provide documents in relation to certain related party transactions in compliance with its obligations under clause 10.1.1 of the IA and this has triggered F co’s rights to appoint an independent accountant. A co has brought a counterclaim in which it is alleged that it has suffered a loss of profits due to F co allegedly failing to approve certain related party transactions since 3 June 2015. In this present Suit 102, F co, through A co, alleges that D &amp; E acted in breach of their fiduciary duties to A co, C co and H co as they are in a position of conflict and have benefitted from and failed to make timely and full and frank disclosure of their interest in certain related party transactions. D &amp; E submit that there will be an overlap in findings as both the arbitral tribunal and the court will have to determine the issue of whether the transactions in question are related party transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Companies submit that there is no overlap between ARB XA and this present Suit 102. They say that ARB XA is a purely a claim against A co for access to documents pursuant to F co’ contractual rights under the IA. In contrast, this present Suit 102 is a claim by the Companies, through a derivative action commenced by F co, for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties owed by D &amp; E as directors of the Companies in relation to a number of related party transactions which have been entered into since 2011 on the basis there was non-disclosure and conflict of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 While there <span class="font-italic">may </span>be some overlap, for the reasons stated below, it is not necessary for this court to determine the question of whether there is indeed any overlap between ARB XA and this action and whether this overlap is such that a case management stay should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inconsistent position taken by the Defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In this present Suit 102, D &amp; E are seeking a stay of the present suit in favour of the arbitration proceedings in ARB XA. On the other hand, as mentioned above, in OS XC, A co is seeking a declaration that the arbitral tribunal in ARB XA has no jurisdiction to hear the dispute in accordance with the Expedited Procedure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In my view, D &amp; E have taken an inconsistent position by filing both this application for a stay of the present Suit 102 and OS XC. On one hand, D &amp; E are seeking a stay of the present proceedings in favour of the arbitration proceedings in ARB XA. On the other hand, A co takes the position that the arbitral tribunal in ARB XA has no jurisdiction under the Expedited Procedure over the claims before it. D &amp; E are effectively taking the position that the current action in Suit 102 should be stayed in favour of arbitration proceedings but it is this same arbitration proceeding which D, through A co, say has no jurisdiction under the Expedited Procedure to hear the issues before it. If a case management stay is granted in favour of ARB XA and if the jurisdiction challenge to the arbitral tribunal is upheld in OS XC, then the end result is that there will be a significant delay in the resolution of the disputes between the parties as the present Suit 102 before the courts will be stayed while the arbitral tribunal is re-constituted to determine the disputes between the parties. This would be an untenable position. It does not serve the ends of justice for the disputes between the parties to be left unresolved while the arbitral tribunal is re-constituted when the present Suit 102 has been commenced and may proceed to determine the issues between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I note that OS XC has been heard by Ang J who held that no orders are to be made in respect of OS XC. Being dissatisfied with this decision, A co has filed a Summons for leave to appeal against Ang J’s decision.  A co’s decision to file the Summons for leave to appeal clearly shows that A co took and continues to take the position that the arbitral tribunal in ARB XA has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues before it. This means that it remains a very real possibility that, if leave is granted to appeal in OS XC, and if a case management stay is granted in this present Suit 102, there will be a significant delay in the determination of issues between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I would pause to note that it may be argued that the applicant in OS XC is A co and not D &amp; E. In my view, this ignores reality. In OS XC, it was D who signed the affidavits in support of the application. This shows that the decision to file the application in OS XC to challenge the jurisdiction of the tribunal was made in consultation with and/or approved by D as director of A co. Therefore, I cannot turn a blind eye to the reality that the decision to file this application to seek a case management stay in favour of arbitration proceedings in ARB XA and the decision to file OS XC were both made by D.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a stay of proceedings with conditions should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 When the D &amp; E’s counsel was queried on the impact of OS XC on this present application for stay of proceedings, it was submitted that a stay can be granted on terms and the stay will be lifted if the terms are not met.  D &amp; E say that this is in line with <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus Ltd v Rex International Holding Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHC 210 where the Aedit Abdullah JC (as he was then) granted a stay of court proceedings on condition that if the tiered dispute resolution was not triggered within three months or an arbitration not commenced within give months from the date of the judgment, the parties would be at liberty to apply to the court to lift the stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I see a number of issues in respect of the proposal for a conditional stay of proceedings in Suit 102. First, the jurisdiction of the tribunal in ARB XA is being challenged with leave being sought to appeal to the Court of Appeal in respect of Ang J’s decision not to make a declaration that the arbitration tribunal has no jurisdiction. It would serve no purpose to stay this present Suit 102 and direct the Companies to include the issues to be determine in this action as part of the arbitration in ARB XA which D &amp; E say has no jurisdiction under the Expedited Procedure. This would just lead to a significant delay in the resolution of these issues. Second, directing the issues in this present Suit 102 to be determined by way of arbitration is an indirect acknowledgement that D &amp; E  are party to the arbitration agreement in the IA. Third, as D &amp; E are not parties to the arbitration agreement, I foresee issues in determining who would be the appropriate party to commence arbitration proceedings against D &amp; E in respect of the alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Companies. Taking into account the fractured relationship between the parties and the litigious position which the parties have taken in past proceedings, I am of the view that it is extremely improbable that F co, A co, D &amp; E would be able to come to an agreement as to the commencement of any arbitration to determine the issues in this present Suit 102. Any conditional stay in favour of arbitration is likely to only cause significant delay in the proceedings with no measurable fruitful gain. For these reasons, I am of the view that this would not be an appropriate case to impose a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration with conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For the reasons above, I decline to grant a case management stay in favour of arbitration pursuant to the court’s inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In all the circumstances and for the above reasons, a stay pursuant to section 6 of the IAA and a case management stay are not granted.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Teck Ping Karen<br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mr Niklas Wong See Keat and Ms Thara Gopalan (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Mr Mahesh Rai, Mr Raeza Ibrahim and Ms Grace Morgan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
