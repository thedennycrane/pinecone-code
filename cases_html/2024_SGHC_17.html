At the end of the first hearing on 26 September 2023, I adjourned the matter for the Applicant’s Counsel to conduct further research on the matter. At the adjourned hearing on 11 October 2023, after hearing further arguments, I dismissed the application. I now give my written grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Claimant (“the Husband”) and Defendant (“the Wife”) were married in Singapore. They migrated to Australia with their two children in February 2009 and settled down in Perth, Western Australia. Unfortunately, the marriage broke down and they took out divorce proceedings in the WA Family Court. The divorce was granted on 2 November 2021. The Court Order, which was dated 9 May 2023, related to the division of their matrimonial property. The Husband was ordered to procure the sale of four real properties that the parties owned jointly: three properties were in Australia and one in Singapore, which was an HDB apartment (“the HDB Flat”). Upon the sale of each property, the Husband was ordered to deposit the net proceeds into an Australian bank account that he was to open jointly with the Wife (“the Joint Account”). From the terms of the Court Order, it would appear that its purpose was to authorise the Husband to sell the four properties and deposit the proceeds into the Joint Account. The Court Order did not make any determination of the division of the matrimonial property and provided for a subsequent hearing to make that determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 It was clear from the manner in which the Court Order was drafted that the Wife had not been cooperating with the WA Family Court. Hence, para 2 of the Court Order provided that a Registrar of the Family Court may sign any document required for the purpose of setting up the Joint Account. The general tenor of the Court Order was one in which the Husband would undertake the sale of all four properties with minimal input from the Wife and the Court was prepared to conduct an “undefended hearing” at a later date if the Wife did not turn up for that hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In this application, the Husband sought to register paras 9 and 10 of the Court Order, which related to the HDB Flat and provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. [The HDB Flat] … vests in the Husband from the date of [the Court Order] and he has absolute discretion and authority to –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Place [the HDB Flat] on the market for sale “as is” within 14 days …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Appoint a real estate agent in Singapore of his choosing (“Agent”) to conduct the sale.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Sell [the HDB Flat] upon such terms and conditions as he sees fit after considering all reasonable recommendations of the Agent in relation to –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The listing price;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) The method of sale; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Any offers received and recommendations as to counter-offers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. Simultaneously with the settlement of the sale of [the HDB Flat], the Husband do all acts necessary to disburse the sale proceeds as follows –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In payment of costs associated with the sale …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) In discharge of HDB Housing Loan …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In replenishment of the Husband’s and the Wife’s respective CPF accounts; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The balance to be deposited into [the Joint Account] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As the HDB Flat was jointly owned by the parties, it was obvious that, for the Husband to effect its sale, he would not be able to rely on the Court Order solely, but would need a corresponding order from a court in Singapore. Therefore, the Husband made this application under the Act. Before embarking on an analysis of the Act, it would be useful to set out a brief history of the legislation relating to the reciprocal enforcement of judgments of courts outside Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Prior to 3 October 2019, the statutory regime for enforcement of judgments of courts outside Singapore was found in the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act 1921 (“RECJA”) for judgments of courts of Commonwealth countries, and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed) (the “REFJA 2001”) for courts outside of the Commonwealth. In 2019, Parliament consolidated the regime by repealing the RECJA and enacting the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Amendment Act) 2019 (Act 25 of 2019) (collectively, the “2019 amendments”) which amended the REFJA 2001 to encompass Commonwealth judgments. Further amendments were made to extend the registrability of foreign orders to include non-money judgments (which includes freezing orders and injunctions, mandatory orders and orders for specific performance), consent judgments, judicial settlements and interlocutory judgments, and of judgments from lower courts of the foreign states. However, the precise scope of enforceable court orders from any foreign court is a matter to be decided and negotiated by the Executive and will in turn depend on various factors, including the suitability of the foreign court and whether that court will grant similar treatment to the court orders of a Singapore court (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(2 September 2019) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)). In <span class="font-italic">Ha Chi </span><span class="font-italic">Kut (suing as the sole executrix of the estate of Khoo Ee Liam, deceased) v Chen Aun-Li Andrew </span>[2023] 3 SLR 283 at [51], Pang Khang Chau J similarly observed that the 2019 amendments “provided a framework for non-money judgments to be registered under the [Act] <span class="font-italic">but did not have the effect of making </span><span class="font-italic">non-money judgments of all descriptions immediately registrable</span>” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Returning to the present application, the governing provision of the Act was s 4, the relevant parts of which stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for, and effect of, registration of foreign judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1) A person, being a judgment creditor under <span class="font-italic">a judgment to which this Part applies</span>, may apply to the General Division of the High Court at any time —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) within 6 years after the date of the judgment; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">to have the judgment registered in the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  On an application under subsection (1), the court shall, subject to proof of the prescribed matters and to the provisions of this Act, order the judgment to be registered.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  A judgment shall not be registered under this section if at the date of the application —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) it has been wholly satisfied;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) it has been discharged; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) it could not be enforced in the country of the original court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  The registering court —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) may only register a non‑money judgment if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the relief contained in the judgment, it is satisfied that enforcement of the judgment would be just and convenient; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if it is of the opinion that such enforcement would not be just and convenient, may make an order for the registration of such amount as it considers to be the monetary equivalent of the relief.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Section 4(1) provided that the application for registration must relate to “a judgment to which [Part 1 of the Act] applies”. Therefore, the first question to decide was whether paras 9 and 10 of the Court Order was a judgment to which Part 1 of the Act applied. To decide this, I turned to s 3 of the Act, the relevant parts of which were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Extension of Part to judgments of recognised courts of foreign countries on basis of reciprocity</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>—(1)  If the Minister is satisfied that, in the event of the benefits conferred by this Part being extended to a particular description of judgments given in a particular court or description of courts of a foreign country, substantial reciprocity of treatment will be assured as respects the enforcement in that foreign country of similar judgments given in a similar court or similar courts of Singapore, the Minister may, <span class="font-italic">by order in the Gazette</span>, direct that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) this Part applies to that foreign country;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the court or courts of the foreign country specified in the order is a recognised court or are recognised courts of the foreign country for the purposes of this Part; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) <span class="font-italic">judgments specified in the order of</span> any such recognised court or courts, if within subsection (2), are judgments to which this Part applies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 This provision required that an order must be made by the Minister and published in the Gazette before the Act applies to a particular type of judgment in a particular court of any foreign country. In this regard, the Minister promulgated the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (United Kingdom and the Commonwealth) Order 2023 (“the Order”) which came into operation on 1 March 2023. Paragraph 2(1) of the Order stated that, for the purposes of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, Part 1 applies to the foreign countries specified in the first column of the Schedule. Australia was one of the countries specified there. Paragraph 2(2) of the Order further stated that, for the purposes of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act, the courts specified in the second column of the Schedule were recognised courts of the foreign countries in the first column of the Schedule. The WA Family Court was specified in the second column of the Schedule in relation to Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I come to the critical part of the Order, which would be para 2(3). This stated that “for the purposes of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, a judgment specified in the third column of the Schedule of a recognised court specified opposite that judgment in the second column of the Schedule is a judgment to which Part 1 of the Act applies”. In relation to the WA Family Court (and indeed to all courts in Australia specified in the second column of the Schedule), the third column provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any money judgment that is final and conclusive as between the parties to it</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Applicant’s Counsel attempted to submit that this description applied to the Court Order. However it was clear that the Court Order was not a money judgment which was defined in s 2 of the Act in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“money judgment” means a judgment under which a sum of money is payable, not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a similar nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Court Order was for the sale of the HDB Flat and did not order any party to make payment of any sum of money. This became clearer when one looks at the definition of non-money judgment in the same section:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“non-money judgment” means a judgment that is not a money judgment, but does not include a judgment under which a sum of money is payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a similar nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the second reading speech to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 19/2019), the Minister explained (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(2 September 2019) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the precise scope of enforceable judgments will be decided and negotiated with each foreign country individually. So, the fact that we have the Act … does not automatically mean that there will be a whole series of countries that will come on board. ... armed with these amendments, we will then proceed to negotiate with foreign countries, and decide in the case of each country, what is suitable, what is appropriate and obviously, on a reciprocal basis.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The factors that will be taken into account will include … the compatibility of our respective court systems – Singapore’s and the foreign courts’ – the needs of users of our Court systems and, of course, our countries’ respective interests. … while [the Act] will provide a broad menu of options available for negotiation, Singapore might enter into an agreement or arrangement with Country A for the reciprocal enforcement of only a limited category of judgments, whereas with Country B, there could be reciprocal enforcement of the full range of judgments under [the Act]. It really depends on what is also being negotiated and what is also being offered by the reciprocal country.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It would appear that the extension to non-money judgments has not yet been made in relation to Australian courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Therefore, this court was unable to come to the assistance of the Husband and I was compelled to dismiss his application.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tok Boon Leong (BL Tok &amp; Co) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">the defendant absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
