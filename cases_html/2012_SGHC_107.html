<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application for
                    the determination of ancillary matters. I have to decide on
                    the division of matrimonial assets and the issue of
                    maintenance for the defendant and a child who has been
                    accepted as a member of the family.</p>

                    Husband”) and the defendant (“the
                    Wife”) were married on 24 March
                        1979.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> They have been living

                    two other children from another relationship, <em>viz</em>, one Yong Wei and one Yong

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Husband applied for and
                    obtained an interim judgment for divorce on 2 July
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I have to consider the
                    following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     the division of
                        matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     maintenance for the Wife;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     maintenance for Yong
                Li.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Court of Appeal held in
                        <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R)
                    743 (“<em>NK</em>”) that
                    there are two broad approaches to the division of
                    matrimonial assets, <em>viz</em>, the
                    “global assessment methodology” and the
                    “classification methodology (see <em>NK</em> at [31]–[32]). I will adopt the global assessment
                    methodology in the present case. It would be conducive to
                    fairness and justice to adopt this approach to minimise the
                    reshuffling of assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I will analyse the issue of
                    the division of matrimonial assets in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     determining and
                        valuing the pool of matrimonial
                    assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     considering the direct contributions
                        of the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     considering the indirect contributions
                        of the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     deciding on a just and equitable
                        apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making
                        orders to achieve this most
                conveniently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 1: Determining and valuing the pool of
                matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The definition of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Section 112(10) of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Charter”) provides for the following
                    definition of matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10)  In this section,
                            “matrimonial asset”
                            means —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    any asset
                                acquired before the marriage by one party or
                                both parties to the
                            marriage —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    ordinarily used or
                                    enjoyed by both parties or one or more of
                                    their children while the parties are
                                    residing together for shelter or
                                    transportation or for household, education,
                                    recreational, social or aesthetic purposes;
                                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   which has been
                                    substantially improved during the marriage
                                    by the other party or by both parties to the
                                    marriage; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    any other asset of any
                                nature acquired during the marriage by one party
                                or both parties to the marriage,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but does not include any asset (not being a
                        matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at
                        any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been
                        substantially improved during the marriage by the other
                        party or by both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The operative date for determining the
                matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As held in a recent Court of
                    Appeal decision (<em>viz</em>,
                        <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo
                        Nancy</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157
                        (“<em>Nancy
                    Tay</em>”)), there is no single operative date
                    that would be applicable in all cases. On the facts in this
                    case, I reached the conclusion that an appropriate cut-off
                    date was the date of the interim judgment for divorce
                    because the hearing for the determination of ancillary
                    matters took place more than three years after the interim
                    judgment for divorce was obtained. For the same reason, I am
                    of the view that the appropriate date for the determination
                    of the matrimonial assets in the present case is the date of
                    the interim judgment. As I have noted above, interim
                    judgment was obtained on 2 July 2008 (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). The hearing of the
                    ancillary matters only took place on 14 November
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It should be noted that for
                    assets acquired after this operative date, the funds used to
                    acquire the assets should be restored to the common pool for
                    the purpose of the division of matrimonial assets (see
                        <em>Nancy Tay</em> at [33]). This is necessary
                    in order to prevent spouses from dissipating the common pool
                    after interim judgment has been granted (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The operative date for valuing the matrimonial
                assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Jointly owned assets
                    should be valued at the date of the judgment for ancillary
                    matters. Matrimonial assets that are held in the names of
                    each party, <em>ie</em>, separately
                    owned matrimonial assets, should be valued at the date on
                    which the matrimonial assets were determined. However, it
                    must be noted that these dates are just starting points.
                    They may be departed from in appropriate cases in order to
                    reach a just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Jointly owned assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The matrimonial home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The parties’
                    matrimonial home at Block 103 Cashew Road #15-01 Cashew
                    Heights Singapore 679674 (“the Matrimonial
                    Home”) was purchased in 1991.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The outstanding
                    mortgage loan on the Matrimonial Home is S$141,501.38 as at
                    31 December 2009 (this is the most recent figure that
                    the parties have placed before me).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    The Husband’s counsel referred me to recent
                    transactions in 2011 (as reflected in the Urban
                    Redevelopment Authority’s records of caveats lodged
                    against properties in the same condominium) which suggested
                    a valuation of around S$1.3m to S$1.45m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The most recent
                    transaction was in the amount of S$1,388,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    Deducting the outstanding mortgage loan from that figure, I
                    will adopt a valuation of S$1,246,498.62.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Joint account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The parties have a joint
                    account with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation
                    (“the Joint Account”). The latest available
                    balance in the account (as at 31 May 2010) is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The values of the vehicles
                    in the preceding paragraph were based on open market values
                    as obtained from the Land Transport Authority
                    (“LTA”). The Husband later recognised that it
                    was incorrect to have used those figures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He
                    then provided the court with values based on figures
                    obtained from the website www.sgcarmart.com on
                    31 January 2011. By this time, however, the Husband had
                    sold the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle and acquired a
                    “Mercedes Benz 250E” motor vehicle with the
                    same registration number of SDH 6688L (“the
                    Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    Hence, he provided a market value for the Mercedes Benz 250E
                    Vehicle instead of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle. This was
                    an error because, as I explain below, the Mercedes Benz 250E
                    Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> below). The market values

                    Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle) as at 31 January 2011, together

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It would have been ideal
                    if the parties had provided me with the market values and
                    outstanding loans as at the date of the interim judgment.
                    Unfortunately, the parties have not provided me with those
                    figures. I must, however, do the best that I can on the
                    evidence available. I accept the Husband’s valuation
                    of the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle and the Alfa Romeo 2.0
                    Vehicle. Taking the latest available figures (<em>ie</em>, the figures in the table at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), I value
                    the Mitsubishi Colt 1.5 Vehicle at S$14,593.85. I will
                    disregard the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle because it has a
                    negative value (see <em>Nancy Tay</em>
                    at [61] where cars
                    bought on hire-purchase were disregarded because they were
                    of negative value).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As for the Mercedes Benz
                    240E Vehicle, the Husband has only provided me with the open
                    market value of that vehicle from the LTA (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). However, it is
                    possible to deduce a more accurate value from other evidence
                    on the record. As noted above, the Husband sold the Mercedes
                    Benz 240E Vehicle and acquired the Mercedes Benz 250E
                    Vehicle in January 2010. According to the “order
                    specifications / booking form” for the Mercedes Benz
                    250E Vehicle (“the Order Form”), another
                    vehicle was traded-in for S$84,000 in the same
                        transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Although
                    the Order Form does not provide the particulars of the
                    vehicle that was traded-in, I gather from the text of the
                    Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means that the
                    vehicle traded-in was the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle. In
                    this affidavit, the Husband explained that one of his
                    reasons for selling the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle was that
                    he was advised that it was better to sell it because
                    “it could still fetch a better price of [S]<em>$84,000</em> (in January 2010) before it
                    approached the 6<sup>th</sup> year by April
                    2010” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> I therefore
                    find that the market price of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle
                    was approximately S$84,000. I should reiterate that this is
                    not the ideal way of valuing the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle
                    because what I should determine is the market price of the
                    Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle as at the date of the interim
                    judgment. On this approach, the value of the Mercedes Benz
                    240E Vehicle is S$22,530.60 (this figure is derived by
                    deducting the only available figure for the outstanding loan
                    for the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (<em>viz</em>, S$61,469.40 (as at 3 April 2009)
                    – see the table at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) from my estimation of the market
                    price of the Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle (<em>viz</em>, $84,000)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As noted above, the
                    Husband purchased the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle in January
                    2010. He claimed that he held the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle
                    on trust for Chong Park Medical Hall (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“Chong Park Singapore”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> I
                    do not accept his bare assertion that the Mercedes Benz 250E
                    Vehicle, which was registered in his name, was held on
                    trust. The Husband produced no documentary evidence to
                    support the existence of the trust. I find, however, that
                    the Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle is not a matrimonial asset
                    simply because it was acquired after the date of the interim
                    judgment.</p>

                    names and qualifications of the authors, were addressed in
                    the Husband’s third affidavit of assets and means. In
                    this affidavit, he exhibited the cover pages of the reports
                    which state the dates, names and qualifications of the
                    author of the reports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> As for the
                    other criticisms, the Wife did not provide her own
                    valuations of the companies in a manner that addressed the
                    criticisms. The approach that she took was to simply
                    criticise aspects of the valuations by the Husband. This
                    leaves me with some difficulty as to how I should value the
                    Husband’s shares in the companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I note that the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>NK</em> ordered the
                    parties to agree to appoint a valuer to value a company
                    within a time period, failing which the court would appoint
                    a valuer (see <em>NK</em> at [54]). The court further
                    ordered that the valuation would be final (see <em>NK</em> at [54]). The dispute did not, however, end
                    there. The husband in <em>NK</em>
                    invoked the “liberty to apply” clause in the
                    court’s order to dispute the valuation of the
                    court-appointed valuer and to seek a revaluation (see
                        <em>NK v NL</em> [2010]
                    4 SLR 792at [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     One option is to follow
                    the approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>NK</em> by ordering the parties to agree to
                    appoint another valuer within a time period, failing which I
                    could appoint a valuer. However, the situation in the
                    present case is different from that in <em>NK</em>. The Court of Appeal in <em>NK</em> did not have a valuation report
                    before it. In contrast, I already have valuation
                    reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In my view, it is not in
                    the interests of fairness and justice to order a further
                    valuation. Such a course would prolong the resolution of the
                    ancillary matters further and would entail further costs for
                    both parties. Notwithstanding Mr Goh’s criticisms, I
                    accept the Husband’s figures as they are the only
                    available evidence before the court of the value of his
                    shares in the companies. Applying the exchange rate that I
                    adopted <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    insurance policies (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above), the Husband’s shares have
                    the following values in SGD:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 14 August 2005,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I first have to determine
                    the value of the Baywater Property at the time of the
                    interim judgment. In his first affidavit of assets and
                    means, the Husband estimated that the Baywater Property had
                    a value of S$600,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> However, the
                    Husband did not provide any basis or documentary evidence
                    for his estimation. It was only in his second affidavit of
                    assets and means that he provided an estimation of S$862,330
                    based on transacted prices as at April 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>
                    In the absence of better evidence of the value of the
                    Baywater Property, I accept the Husband’s estimation
                    of S$862,330. The outstanding mortgage loan as at
                    5 February 2010 is S$385,421.63.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span>
                    Hence, I estimate the net value of the Baywater Property to
                    be S$476,908.37.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I next have to determine
                    the value of the <em>Husband’s
                        share</em> of the Baywater Property at the time of
                    the interim judgment. The Husband and Fan are joint tenants
                    of the Baywater Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> At the time
                    of the interim judgment, the Husband was not married to Fan
                    (according to the Husband’s counsel, the Husband and
                    Fan married in 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>).
                    Their contributions to the purchase price of the Baywater
                    Property were unequal, with Fan contributing
                        more.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> In view of
                    their unequal contributions, at the time of the interim
                    judgment, there would have been a presumption of resulting
                    trust, <em>ie</em>, the Husband and Fan
                    would be presumed to hold the Baywater Property as tenants
                    in common at equity in the proportions of their contribution
                    to the purchase price (see <em>Lau Siew Kim v
                        Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</em> [2008] 2
                    SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em>”) at [107]). There would not have
                    been a counter-presumption of advancement because, at the
                    time of the interim judgment, the Husband and Fan were not
                    in a spousal relationship and the conventional position is
                    that the presumption of advancement does not apply in a
                        <em>de facto</em> spousal
                    relationship (see <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>
                    at [73]). Although
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> did not exclude the possibility of a
                    future argument for the expansion of the presumption to such
                    relationships (see <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [74]), no argument was made by either party
                    that the presumption of advancement was applicable as
                    between the Husband and Fan at the time of the interim
                    judgment. I see no reason why the presumption of resulting
                    trust would be rebutted in the present case. Hence, I find
                    that at the time of the interim judgment, the Husband and
                    Fan held the Baywater Property as tenants in common at
                    equity in the proportions of their contributions to the
                    purchase price. As for the proportions held by the Husband
                    and Fan, mortgage repayments and other financial
                    contributions after the acquisition of the Baywater Property
                    will not be considered unless there was an agreement between
                    them on the repayment of the mortgage (see <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [115]–[116]).
                    There is no evidence of an agreement between the Husband and
                    Fan on the amounts that they would each contribute towards
                    the mortgage on the Baywater Property. Hence, I can only
                    take into account their contributions to the downpayment. In
                    this regard, I accept that the Husband contributed S$45,590
                    and Fan contributed S$75,810 to the S$121,400
                        downpayment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> On this
                    view, the Husband’s share of the Baywater Property was
                    37.5% at the time of the interim judgment. On my valuation
                    of the Baywater Property, the Husband share is accordingly

                    determine the true value from the Bursa Malaysia statements
                    that the Wife exhibited in her affidavit because those

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 2: Considering the direct financial
                contributions of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     There was initially a
                    dispute on the extent of the Wife’s direct cash
                    contributions to the Matrimonial Home. The Wife asserted
                    that she paid an amount of S$14,688 as part of the
                    downpayment and that she contributed S$10,000 for
                        renovations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband disputed this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>
                    However, at the hearing before me, both counsel agreed that
                    it was “not really disputed” that the
                    proportions of the direct contributions were 75:25 in favour
                    of the Husband. In the light of this concession, I find that
                    the direct contributions to the Matrimonial Home were in the
                    ratio of 75:25 in the Husband’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Apart from the
                    contributions to the Matrimonial Home, the Husband deposed
                    in his third affidavit of assets and means to paying for
                    utility bills, telephone bills, television and cable
                    television charges, management corporation charges,
                    household maintenance and repairs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 3: Considering the indirect contributions of
                the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Wife resigned from her
                    employment as a personal assistant in 1993 to take care of
                    Yong Jun and Yong Li.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> There
                    was initially some dispute as to whether the Wife cared for
                    the children. In his second affidavit of assets and means,
                    the Husband deposed that his mother took care of the
                    children, that he enlisted a maid to assist in caring for
                    the children and that the Wife “hardly looked after
                    the children”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> The
                    Wife contested this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> She also
                    referred to an affidavit filed by her former maid in which
                    it was deposed that the Husband’s mother did not play
                    a role in Yong Li’s care. The former maid also said
                    that the Wife showed Yong Li “unconditional
                    care” and that the Wife was a “full-time
                    mother” after she gave up her employment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Yong Jun
                    and Yong Li also filed affidavits. Yong Jun deposed that the
                    Wife was an “exemplary mother” and that she
                    committed to being a full-time mother after she resigned
                    from her employment in 1993.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Yong Li
                    expressed her gratitude at the Wife’s acceptance of
                    her notwithstanding that she was not her biological
                        daughter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> She also
                    explained that she was cared for by her mother with the
                    assistance of their former maid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> I accept
                    that the Wife made extensive indirect contributions in
                    caring for the children. Indeed, in his written submissions,
                    the Husband’s counsel submitted that the Husband
                    acknowledged and was grateful for the role that the Wife
                    played in the care of Yong Jun and Yong Li.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     However, the Husband
                    asserted that he also helped to care for the
                        children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> He
                    referred in this regard to affidavits deposed to by Yong Jun
                    and Yong Li:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     Yong Jun deposed
                        that his father contributed financially to the
                            family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> He
                        also paid for his overseas education.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>
                        Yong Jun said that he would not have graduated without
                        the Husband’s “moral and financial
                            support”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> Yong
                        Jun also recounted that his father bought him the Alfa
                        Romeo 2.0 Vehicle as a reward for his good results at a
                            polytechnic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Yong
                        Jun further deposed that the Husband assisted him with
                        starting a business by the name of “Alldo
                        Resources Sdn Bhd” (“Alldo
                            Resources”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>
                        He claimed that the Husband assisted him with running
                        the business when Yong Jun decided to further his
                        education overseas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     Yong Li deposed
                        that the Husband has been supporting the family
                            financially.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> The
                        Husband also covered her expenses and gave her the money
                        that she needed, both for education expenses as well as
                        other expenses such as holiday trips.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     On the basis of the
                    evidence of Yong Jun and Yong Li, which I accept, I find
                    that the Husband also contributed both financially and
                    non-financially to the care for the children. However, it is
                    fair to say that the Wife’s contributions were more
                    substantial. The Husband’s non-financial contributions
                    were supportive in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Wife also claimed to
                    have contributed to Chong Park Singapore after her
                    resignation from her previous employment in 1993. She
                    explained that she oversaw the company’s operations
                    together with the Husband and joined him on overseas trips.
                    She claimed that she provided the “essential
                    backup” in Singapore that the Husband could rely
                    upon, such that he was able to travel overseas for long
                        periods.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband disputed this. He claimed that the Wife’s role
                    was “nominal”. He said that she merely signed
                    documents for the company as a director. He claimed that she
                    hardly went to the company’s office and did not go for
                    sales trips. She did not also travel for
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I find the Wife’s
                    claims of having contributed extensively to Chong Park
                    Singapore to be inconsistent with her claim that she was a
                    full time caregiver to her children upon her resignation
                    from her previous employment in 1993. I find that it is more
                    likely that she was a full time mother from 1993 and that
                    she played, at most, a minor role in Chong Park
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Step 4: Deciding on a just and equitable
                apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making orders to
                achieve this most conveniently</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preliminary issue: Should an adverse inference be
                drawn against either party?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law on drawing adverse
                inferences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The parties have a duty of
                    full and frank disclosure (see <em>NK</em> at [57]). If a party fails to comply with this
                    duty, an adverse inference may be drawn. There are at least
                    two possible consequences to the drawing of an adverse
                    inference. First, the court may divide the matrimonial
                    assets on the basis of the assets that were disclosed (see
                        <em>NK</em> at [58]). This approach
                    entails ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed assets
                    to the other party (see <em>NK</em> at
                        [62]).
                    Alternatively, the court may determine the value of the
                    undeclared assets (see <em>NK</em> at
                        [59]). In
                    pursuing this second approach, the court must be careful not
                    to be unnecessarily speculative in determining the values of
                    the undeclared assets (see <em>NK</em>
                    at [61]). As will be
                    seen, I have adopted the first approach because there is no
                    basis for me to determine the true amount of the undeclared
                    assets with any accuracy.</p>

                    on 19 November 2009 that “he had no other
                    business entities in Singapore or

                    noted that the existence of his interests in the two
                    companies was first raised by the Wife in her second
                    affidavit of assets and means dated 22 February
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Husband’s
                    explanation for this was that his first affidavit of assets
                    and means and his answers to interrogatories were filed by
                    his previous solicitors and were incomplete.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> He
                    corrected this omission by making full disclosure in his
                    subsequent affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I do not accept the
                    Husband’s explanation. The very first page of his
                    first affidavit of assets and means stated that he
                    “made full and frank disclosure of [his] assets and
                    means” and that he has “no other assets and
                    means aside from what has been disclosed in [the]

                    have been clear to the Husband that he had a duty to
                    disclose all his assets. He cannot hide behind the
                    convenient fact that he had a change of
                solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(II)   Income from companies in Singapore and
                MAlaysia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Wife referred to Chong
                    Park Singapore’s balance sheet for the financial year
                    which ended on 31 July 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> This balance sheet
                    indicated that an amount of S$727,944 was due to Chong Park
                    Singapore’s directors in 2008. For the year 2009, this
                    amount was reduced by S$111,043 to S$616,901. The cash flow
                    statement in the balance sheet indicated that this amount
                    was paid to directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> The
                    Wife pointed out that Chong Park Singapore has only two
                    directors, <em>viz</em>, the Husband
                    and herself. As she did not receive any payment, she
                    submitted that the payment must have been made to the
                        Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> The

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Husband’s
                    explanation for the amount reflected in the balance sheet as
                    being due to the directors is that those monies were loans
                    given by his mother, aunt and uncle to Chong Park Singapore.
                    He claims that the benefit of those loans was transferred to
                    him when they transferred their shares to him in
                        1989.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Husband’s
                    explanation does not satisfactorily explain the reason for
                    the reduction in the amount due to the directors. Even if
                    the amount reflected as being due to the directors was a
                    loan from the Husband’s relatives, he has not
                    explained the reason for the <em>reduction</em> in that amount in 2009 with an
                    accompanying outward cash flow. He has not also contradicted
                    the Wife’s assertion that she did not receive the
                    amount of S$111,043. The only remaining possibility is that
                    the Husband received that amount. His failure to disclose
                    this fact was a breach of his duty of full and frank
                    disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Wife next referred to
                    inconsistencies in the Husband’s affidavits on the
                    source of his declared income from Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> For
                    example, the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and
                    means stated that he drew a RM96,000 annual income from Jun
                        Marketing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span>
                    However, he later claimed that this income was from Chong
                    Park Pharmaceuticals in 2007 and from IDR Superior in
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> She
                    also referred to the financial statements of the Malaysian
                    companies of which the Husband was a director. These
                    financial statements indicated that directors’ fees,
                    remuneration and bonuses of various amounts were paid. The
                    amounts that were paid out exceeded the Husband’s
                    disclosed Malaysia-sourced income (<em>ie</em>, RM96,000 per annum).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> The Wife
                    submitted that it was “logical to believe”
                    that the Husband received most if not all of the money that
                    these companies paid to its directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Husband explained that
                    the inconsistencies in relation to the source of his income
                    were mistakes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> As for
                    the directors’ fees paid by the other Malaysian
                    companies, he explained that his <em>fellow
                        directors</em> received those amounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> He
                    asserted that his annual income from Malaysia was, as
                    declared, <em>viz</em>,
                        RM96,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> As

                        return.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> He also
                    produced the income tax notices of his fellow directors
                    disclosing that they received the relevant directors’
                    fees, remuneration and bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> At the hearing before me,
                    his counsel also offered to arrange for these directors to
                    file affidavits to confirm that they received those
                        amounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I accept the
                    Husband’s explanations for the inconsistencies in the
                    source of his income. I also accept that his
                    Malaysia-sourced income was only RM96,000. His assertion
                    that he only received that amount was not unsubstantiated.
                    He was able to produce documentary evidence which, on its
                    face, supported his assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(III)   Loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino
                Distributors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Wife also referred to
                    the unaudited balance sheets of Rhino Distributors for the
                    years which ended on 31 December 2007 and
                    31 December 2008. The balance sheets disclosed a loan
                    from Alldo Resources in the amount of
                        RM1,139,229.32.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> The
                    Wife submitted that Yong Jun, who was a director and 50%
                    owner of Alldo Resources, was a cover for the
                        Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> She
                    asserted that the Husband was running Alldo Resources even
                    though he claimed to have no interest in the
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Husband referred to an
                    affidavit by Yong Jun in which Yong Jun deposed that he is a
                    director and shareholder of Alldo Resources and that the
                    Husband had helped him to run the business while he was
                    studying in Australia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> As for
                    the loan from Alldo Resources to Rhino Distributors, the
                    Husband pointed out that the <em>audited</em> accounts of Rhino Distributors do
                    not reveal that such a loan was made.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I accept that the
                    Husband’s role in Alldo Resources was to assist Yong
                    Jun in running the business. There is no reason to
                    disbelieve Yong Jun’s evidence that he was a
                    shareholder and director of Alldo Resources and that his
                    father’s role in the company was to simply assist him
                    in running it in his absence. In view of this finding, the
                    issue of whether a loan was made to Rhino Distributors is
                    immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(IV)   Expenses beyond disclosed
                income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Wife submitted that
                    the Husband’s disclosed monthly expenses totalled
                    S$20,875, excluding his own personal and other
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span>
                    The Husband’s counsel disputed this estimation. He
                    said it included Yong Jun’s expenses for his overseas
                    education even though Yong Jun had completed his
                        education.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span>
                    However, even so, the Husband’s expenses exceeded his
                    declared monthly income of S$6,163.50 and
                        RM8,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> At the
                    exchange rate of RM2.47 per unit of SGD (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above), his net monthly
                    income is S$9,402.37. His expenses far exceed his
                    income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Husband’s
                    explanation for how he is able to cope with the shortfall is
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     He charged some
                        of his expenses, such as for his cars and his meals, to
                        his companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     The expenses for his car (the
                        Mercedes Benz 250E Vehicle) were paid for by Chong Park
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     Fan assisted him financially by
                        making contributions to his personal
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I do not accept the
                    Husband’s explanation for how he is able to maintain
                    his expenses with his current income. Even if the first two
                    explanations are taken into account, the shortfall is still
                    substantial. His claim that Fan assists him financially is a
                    bare assertion. The Husband must have some other undisclosed
                    assets or sources of income to support his
                expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(V)   Other assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Wife claimed that the
                    Husband tried to hide his purchase of the Mercedes Benz 250E
                        Vehicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I accept the
                    Husband’s explanation that the non-disclosure of the
                    purchase was not intentional. The Husband’s
                    explanation is that the non-disclosure of the new vehicle
                    was an error because it had the same license number as his
                    previous vehicle (<em>ie</em>, the
                    Mercedes Benz 240E Vehicle). He further explained that he
                    had no intention to hide the purchase because he exhibited a
                    document on the Preferential Additional Registration Fee /
                    Certificate of Entitlement rebate for the Mercedes Benz 250E
                    Vehicle in his second affidavit of assets and means. If his
                    non-disclosure was intentional, he would not have disclosed
                    that document.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Finally, the Wife referred
                    to the Husband’s failure to disclose the existence of
                    his four Standard Chartered Bank accounts (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above). The Wife first
                    raised the existence of three of these accounts in her
                    second affidavit of assets and means dated 23 February
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> The Husband
                    then disclosed the four accounts in his second affidavit of
                    assets and means dated 21 September 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband’s explanation for his non-disclosure was that
                    the accounts were closed and the balances were used to
                    finance the operations of Rhino Distributors. His
                    explanation was not satisfactory because the accounts were
                    only closed in the course of 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> There is no reason

<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Alleged non-disclosures by the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Husband argued that an
                    adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife for her
                    alleged non-disclosure of income. These arguments were made
                    in the context of the Wife’s claims for maintenance.
                    However, they are also relevant to the issue of division of
                    matrimonial assets. Hence, I will consider his arguments
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Husband first argued
                    that the Wife claimed to have given tuition for about 10
                    hours a week, which earned her S$540 per month. The Husband
                    argued that the figures did not tally because, according to
                    him, the market rate for tuition is at least S$40–S$50
                    per hour. Hence, the Wife should be earning a total of
                    S$1,600–S$2,000 a month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span> He
                    also argued that the Wife’s disclosures of her recent
                    jobs, and her income from those jobs, were not supported by
                    any documentary evidence. I accept the Wife’s
                    explanation that her income from tuition was not as much as
                    the Husband asserted because of her relatively lower level
                    of education (she has an “Ordinary” Level
                    General Certificate of Education).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> I do
                    not consider her failure to produce documentary evidence to
                    substantiate her other sources of income to be of any
                    significance. The Wife actually disclosed that she received
                    income from those sources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Next, the Husband argued
                    that the Wife failed to disclose her dividend income from
                    her shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> The
                    Wife’s explanation was that she was not able to obtain
                    records of the dividends that she received in the years 2008
                    and 2009 and that she was only able to deduce the amount of
                    dividends that she earned in the year 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> I find
                    that the Wife did not deliberately fail to disclose her
                    dividend income. Her very first affidavit of assets and
                    means exhibited her notice of assessment of taxable income
                    (dated 5 August 2008).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span> This
                    assessment noted her dividend income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Finally, the Husband
                    submits that the Wife failed to disclose the existence of
                    her investments in unit trusts and her shares in Malaysian
                    companies until her third affidavit of assets and
                        means.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span> This
                    is not strictly accurate because her first affidavit of
                    assets and means exhibited her CPF Investment Scheme Special
                    Account Investment Portfolio.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span> This
                    portfolio statement disclosed three of her investments in
                    unit trusts. Hence, the Wife could only be said to have
                    breached her duty of full and frank disclosure <em>vis-à-vis</em> one of her investments and
                    her investment in Malaysian shares (which she claims was
                    inadvertent – see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The just and equitable apportionment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The Husband submitted that
                    the Matrimonial Home should be sold, with the proceeds to be
                    apportioned in the ratio of 60:40 in his favour. He further
                    proposed that each party retain the assets held in his or
                    her name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The Wife submitted that
                    the Husband’s share of the Matrimonial Home should be
                    transferred to her because she has been living there since
                    its purchase and she wants to retain her present lifestyle.
                    She proposed that the Husband transfer his share without any
                    refund to his CPF account. She also proposed that the
                    Husband should repay the outstanding mortgage
                        loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> As for the
                    other assets, she made the following proposals:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     She will not
                        “make a claim” on the Husband’s
                        share of the Baywater Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     Chong Park
                        Singapore should be valued and the Husband should buy
                        over her share in Chong Park Singapore at 50% of the
                        determined value.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Husband’s Malaysian
                        companies should be valued and the Wife should be
                        entitled to 50% of the Husband’s shares in the
                        companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Husband is to repay the
                        outstanding loan taken on the Great Eastern Life Policy
                        (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above).
                        The Wife submitted that the Great Eastern Life Policy
                        should be maintained because insurers are unwilling to
                        provide her with coverage because of her medical
                        condition (she suffers from Systemic Lupus
                        Erythematosus, scoliosis and myofascial
                            syndrome<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Wife should be
                        given 50% of the Husband’s money in his bank
                        accounts (including the amount in the Public Growth
                        Fund).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Wife also proposed that she be
                        given 50% of the HSBC Structured Investment. However,
                        this proposal is no longer tenable in view of my
                        conclusion that this investment was not a matrimonial
                        asset (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Wife will not “make a
                        claim” on the Husband’s CPF savings and
                        shares in listed companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_h"></a>(h)     The Husband should transfer
                        his SRC membership to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Husband should
                        transfer ownership of the Alfa Romeo 2.0 Vehicle to the
                        Wife. He should repay the outstanding loan on the
                        vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_j"></a>(j)     The Wife should be allowed to keep
                        her shares in listed companies because she claims to
                        have started her investments before her marriage. She
                        further claims that some of the shares belonged to her
                        father.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_k"></a>(k)     The Wife should retain her CPF
                        monies, investments in unit trusts, shares in Malaysian
                        companies and her savings in her bank account with Yong
                        Jun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Wife’s approach
                    will entail more costs and administrative burden for both
                    parties because several assets will have to be transferred.
                    As I noted above, I consider it to be in the interests of
                    fairness and justice that I take a global approach to
                    dividing the matrimonial assets in the light of the direct
                    and indirect contributions, as well as other relevant
                    factors (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In addition to the factors
                    that I have already considered above (<em>viz</em>, the direct and indirect contributions
                    and the non-disclosures), I should also consider the
                    following in deciding on the proportion of the
                    division:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     There is no
                        indication that the Wife paid any rent for her exclusive
                        occupation of the Matrimonial Home since the Husband
                        moved out in 1996. This is a relevant consideration
                        under the Charter (see s 112(2)(f) of the
                        Charter);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     The parties had a fairly long
                        marriage (they were married for 31 years), however, they
                        were also separated for an extended period of 14
                        years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Taking into account the
                    direct and indirect contributions of the parties, the
                    non-disclosures by the parties (with the Husband’s
                    non-disclosures being more substantial), the fact that the
                    Wife enjoyed a substantial period of rent-free occupation
                    and the fact that the parties were separated for a
                    substantial proportion of their long marriage, I order that
                    the matrimonial assets should be divided equally. On this
                    division, each party is entitled to
                S$1,290,245.22.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Wife requested in her
                    skeletal arguments for the Husband to repay a S$36,000 loan
                    that she alleges he took out against the Great Eastern Life
                    Policy (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above).
                    The fact that this loan was taken out before was not
                    previously disclosed. It was suggested above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> that there is no evidence
                    of the existence of the loan. I therefore disregard this
                    allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consequential orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I make these orders with a
                    view to minimising the reshuffling of assets and ensuring a
                    clean break in the parties’ relationship:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife is to
                        transfer her shares in Chong Park Singapore to the
                        Husband for a nominal consideration of S$1. With this
                        order, the assets in the Wife’s name will be
                        reduced to S$434,540.83. A sum of S$855,704.39 would
                        have to be paid to her to equalise the division of
                        matrimonial assets. I will round this down to
                        S$855,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Matrimonial Home is to be sold on
                        the open market within a period of six months from the
                        date of this judgment, with liberty to apply for further
                        extensions if necessary. A sum of S$855,000 from the
                        sale proceeds is to be paid to the Wife. This amount
                            <em>includes</em> the CPF
                        monies which she spent in the purchase of the
                        Matrimonial Home.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     The remainder of the sale proceeds is
                        to be paid to the Husband.</p>

                        closed. The remaining balance is to be paid to the

                            regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the
                            financial position in which they would have been if
                            the marriage had not broken down and each had
                            properly discharged his or her financial obligations

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As the Court of Appeal
                    recently recognised, the objective in s 114(2) of the

                    “commonsense holistic approach” (see <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam </em><em>Heng Chow</em> [2012] SGCA 15

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In its present form, Clause 5(1) requires the
                            court, first, to consider the relevant factors set
                            out in paragraphs (a) to (f) and then so
                            far as it is practicable and, having regard to the
                            conduct of the parties, “just to do
                            so”, to put the party in whose favour the
                            order is to be made in the position he or she would
                            or should have been had the marriage not broken
                                down. <em>This formula could
                                lead to the conclusion that, where no question
                                of penalising misconduct arises, and where there
                                is enough money to do so, the court must put the
                                payee in his “pre-breakdown”
                                position, regardless of the effect on the payer.
                                This could produce a most unfortunate result. If
                                one takes a case where there is a decree granted
                                to a wife petitioner on the grounds of five
                                years’ separation and no question arises
                                of misconduct by either husband or wife, the
                                wife may be receiving an appreciable income of
                                her own—for example from practice as a
                                doctor or from the profits of a
                                business—which is much greater than that
                                of her husband. From the way the parties behaved
                                before the breakdown, it may be clear that, but
                                for the breakdown, the wife would have continued
                                to be the financial mainstay of the family. It
                                would hardly be right for the husband to claim
                                that, on divorce, he was entitled to be put back
                                in his financial status quo, even if this meant
                                the wife's paying him more than half her
                                income.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>It is notoriously true that two
                                separate homes are much more expensive to run
                                than one. It will, therefore, in almost every
                                case be impracticable so to reallocate the
                                resources of the parties as to put one spouse in
                                his or her pre-breakdown financial position
                                without drastically reducing the standard of
                                living of the other. In some cases, for example
                                where that other's conduct is the more
                                blameworthy, this may be a fair result. But
                                where there is no question of one being more to
                                blame than the other, it will not be fair. The
                                principle underlying the Amendment is that the
                                court should aim at getting as near as possible
                                to putting both parties in their pre-breakdown
                                financial position, so that, where some
                                reduction in the standard of living is
                                inevitable (as it usually will be), that
                                reduction is shared and not borne entirely by
                                one party—save where his own bad conduct
                                makes it just that he should be the one to
                                suffer the greater financial
                            loss.</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Consequently (and in accordance with this commonsense

                        gainful employment and contribute to preserve her

                    she has not disclosed the sources of her income and that she
                    can earn as much as S$4,800 to S$6,000 per month, if not
                    more. Given these circumstances, he submitted that no order
                    of maintenance should be made.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span> It should
                    be noted that the Husband’s allegations in relation to
                    the Wife’s sources of income and the amount that she
                    earned from tuition have been dealt with above (see
                        <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>). I accepted
                    the Wife’s explanations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The Wife estimated her
                    monthly expenses at S$3,260. She submitted that in order to
                    sustain her present lifestyle, she would need monthly
                    maintenance in the sum of S$5,000. This represents an
                    increase of S$1,500 from the S$3,500 that she used to
                    receive from the Husband after she resigned from her
                    employment in 1993. She justified the increased amount on
                    the basis of an increase in living and medical costs and her
                    need to employ a full-time maid in the light of her medical
                        condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span> She also
                    wanted her maintenance payments to be backdated to the date
                    of filing of the writ for divorce. She submitted that she
                    should receive lump sum maintenance of S$720,000 on the
                    basis of a 12-year multiplier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In my view, maintenance in
                    the amount of S$720,000 was extravagant in the light of the
                    assets and means of the parties. As I have noted above, the
                    Husband has not fully disclosed his assets and income.
                    However, his non-disclosures were taken into account in the
                    division of matrimonial assets, with the effect that the
                    Wife was awarded a higher proportion of the matrimonial
                    assets than I would have awarded if full disclosure was
                    made. I should also take into account the fact that the Wife
                    has a considerable portfolio of shares from which she earned
                    a dividend income of S$6,056 in the year 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span> She

                    prefer to order lump sum maintenance. There is no fixed rule
                    on the multiplier to be used for this purpose (see <em>Foo Ah Yan</em> at [18]). The Husband was 55
                    years of age at the time of the filing of his first
                    affidavit of assets and means on 8 June 2009. This
                    means that he is presently 57 or 58 years old. The Wife is
                    54 or 55 years old at present. In the circumstances, a
                    multiplier of 12 years would be excessive. I will use a
                    multiplier of eight years. On this multiplier, the lump sum
                    maintenance award is S$192,000. This sum is to be paid
                    within a month of the completion of the sale of the
                    Matrimonial Home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The Wife also sought the
                    recovery of arrears of maintenance in the amount of
                    S$49,378.48 from 2005 to 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span> She
                    claims that, since 2005, when the Husband purchased the
                    Baywater Property, he ceased reimbursing her for monthly
                    expenses. She claimed that the Husband only paid her S$1,000
                        sporadically.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband disputed the Wife’s claims for arrears. He
                    asserted that there is no basis for such a claim. He also
                    pointed out that the court had made an order for him to pay
                    monthly maintenance of S$1,000 from November 2008. No order
                    was made for the payment of arrears.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> I agree.
                    The Wife has not explained the basis for her to claim those
                    amounts, which allegedly accrued <em>prior</em> to the institution of the divorce
                    proceedings, in these ancillary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance of Yong Li</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Yong Li is presently
                    above the age of 21 years. She is undergoing her university
                    education. She is entitled to maintenance under
                    s 69(5)(c) of the Charter. The Husband is presently
                    paying for her expenses and her school fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span> Yong Li
                    confirmed in an affidavit that the Husband is indeed paying
                    for her educational and other additional
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In the circumstances, I
                    will make no order for the Husband to pay the Wife
                    maintenance for Yong Li. Yong Li may, of course, apply for
                    maintenance herself should the Husband cease to pay her
                    maintenance (see s 69(3)(b) of the
                Charter).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Considering all the
                    facts and circumstances of this case, I make no order as to
                    costs subject to the following. If either party feels there
                    are special circumstances that entitles one party to an
                    order for costs against the other party, that party is at
                    liberty to apply, for oral argument therefor within 10 days
                    from the date hereof, failing which my order on costs will
                    stand. The parties shall have liberty to
                apply.</p>
