The three accused persons were convicted on the charge that they</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(O)n the 17<sup>th</sup> day of August

  2001, at about 3.45 pm., at 732, Upper Changi Road East, #02-02, Singapore, in furtherance

  of the common intention of all of (them), did jointly traffic in a controlled drug

  specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter

  185, to wit, by having in (their) possession for the purpose of trafficking 43 packets, 1

  sachet and 1 orange bowl of loose yellow granular substances and some loose yellow

  granular substances, containing not less than 112.91 grams of diamorphine, without any

  authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and, (they) have

  thereby committed offences under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of

  Drugs Act, Chapter 185 and section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under

  section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.

        The place of the offence is an apartment within

a condominium known as the Cascadale at Upper Changi Road. The three accused persons were

arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") in an operation

directed at them.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.

        The first accused Azman bin Ismail

("Azman") who is also known as Jio and Man was kept under surveillance when he

went to the apartment on the day of arrest, 17 August 2001 at about 1.50 pm. He left the

apartment at about 2.05 pm and went by taxi to the Kranji MRT station. At about 2.40 pm a

van drove up to the station. A person came out of the van with a travelling bag. They met,

Azman handed something to him, and took over the bag. Azman then left the station in

another taxi. At about 3.10 pm when the taxi was at the junction of Upper Changi Road East

and Upper Changi Road North CNB officers intercepted it, arrested Azman and seized the

bag. Azman was searched and the keys to the apartment and a sum of $42,364.29 were

recovered from him. The bag was found to contain 30 packets of heroin. Azman faced a

separate charge for trafficking in these drugs, but this charge was stood down pending the

disposal of the joint charge against him, Ruzaini and Isnin.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.

        The second accused Ruzaini bin Ajis

("Ruzaini") who is also known as Kecik was the next person arrested. He was

arrested at about 3.35 pm at the driveway of Cascadale condominium.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.

        The third accused Mohamed Isnin bin Saleh

("Isnin") who is also known as Boy, Arab and Nin was arrested at about 3.43 pm

in the master bedroom of the apartment after the CNB officers gained entry into the

apartment using the keys recovered from Azman. Isnin also had the apartment keys with him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.

        Azman and Ruzaini were taken to the apartment

after their arrests. When the CNB officers searched the apartment 23 packets of

diamorphine were found concealed in the ceiling of the master bedroom toilet and another

20 packets of the same drugs were hidden in the ceiling of the kitchen toilet. These 43

packets contained 112.23g of diamorphine, almost all the diamorphine found in the

apartment. The rest of 0.68g of diamorphine was found in a plastic bowl, an unsealed

sachet, and a loose pile on the floor of the master bedroom. It transpired that the

investigation officer scooped and packed the loose pile of drugs into 25 sachets before

any photograph was taken of it in their original state. That should have waited. The drugs

should have been photographed in the state they were found when there was no danger of

them being dispersed or lost. The packing should be done after photographs are taken.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman’s statements</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.

        The first officer to question Azman was

Inspector Herman bin Mohamed Hamli. Insp Herman recorded the exchange<sup>2</sup> -</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : The stuff inside the Umbro

  bag [the travelling bag recovered from the taxi] belongs to who?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : I do not know. Sam asked me to go

  to Kranji and he told me later someone will give.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : Who is Sam?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : Sam is my friend. I do not know

  his number.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : What is the stuff inside?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : I do not know.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.

        Azman was brought into the apartment, and he,

Ruzaini and Isnin were questioned on the drugs found there. He said that he did not know

who the drugs belonged to.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. Later on Insp Herman questioned Azman

further<sup>4</sup> -</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : The stuff inside the house

  belongs to who?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : I do not know.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : How did the keys to this

  house is inside your bag?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : This morning, Sam called my

  handphone. He asked me to come to this house. He hid the keys inside the plants in front

  of the house. I took the keys and went inside. I smoked heroin. Later, a man from Malaysia

  called my handphone. He asked me to go to Kranji to receive stuff.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Insp Herman : After you took the bag what

  happened?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman : I waited. Sam called me asking me

  to come here. I took a taxi to come here but I was arrested.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.

        On 22 August 2001 Azman made a cautioned

statement to a charge of trafficking the drugs recovered from the taxi, in which he said<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I do not admit to the charge. I was not

  aware that the thing I was carrying contain drugs. I received instructions from a friend

  to carry the bag. I was then told to send the bag to a Condominium in Upper Changi Road.

  Another person would then received the bag.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He also made another cautioned statement

in response to a charge of trafficking the drugs in the apartment. In this cautioned

statement<sup>6</sup> he denied the charge.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.

        Two investigations statements were recorded

from him on 27 and 29 August.<sup>7</sup> In the first statement, he stated that on the

day of the arrest he received a call from a friend he knows as Brother, who is a male

Malaysian Malay. Brother told him that there would be work for him later, and instructed

him to go to Cascadale condominium to collect the keys to unit #02-02 from the letter box.

He was to go to the kitchen of the apartment, collect a black bag holding more than

$40,000 and go to Kranji MRT station where he was to meet a person and exchange the money

for a bag. He went to the apartment as instructed. He found the bag of money, took a drink

and left the apartment with the bag. He took a taxi to Kranji MRT station. On the way

there he received a call from Brother that he was not to give the money to the person at

the station. At the station, he met with a male Chinese who arrived in a van. That person

placed the bag in front of him and left. He took the bag and boarded another taxi to go

back to Upper Changi Road. While he was in the taxi Brother called again and told him that

someone would collect the money and the bag from him at the lobby of Cascadale

condominium. In the event he was arrested before reaching his destination.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.

        In the second statement, Azman said that he had

worked for Brother on a previous occasion. On that occasion Brother offered him a job

collecting VCDs. He went to Kranji MRT station and collected two bags from a man and he

delivered to Brother at Beach Road and was paid $2000. Three days prior to his arrest,

Brother asked if he could do a similar job for him, and he agreed.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Ruzaini’s statements</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.

        Ruzaini made his first statement<sup>8</sup> to

Station Inspector Ronnie See Su Khoon. He told S.I. See that he was waiting for his friend

Azman as they had arranged to meet at the garden of Cascadale condominium and go to

Orchard Road. He had not gone into the apartment and the drugs in the apartment did not

belong to him, and he did not know anything about them.<sup>9</sup> He repeated to Insp.

Herman that he did not know who the drugs belonged to<sup>10</sup> when the inspector

questioned him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.

        On 22 August, in answer to a joint charge with

his two co-accused for trafficking the drugs recovered in the apartment, he made a

cautioned statement that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I was arrested at the car park and not in

  the house. I was not in possession of any drugs when I was arrested. I do not know

  anything about the drugs found in the house.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Isnin’s statements</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.

        When Isnin was questioned by Insp. Herman on

the day of arrest he stated that he did not know who the drugs in the apartment belonged

to.<sup>12</sup> On 18 August he gave a cautioned statement<sup>13</sup> that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I received instructions from my friend to

  pack drugs but he was not the one who was arrested together with me. I do not know

  anything about the 43 packets of heroin. I only found out about it when CNB found the

  heroin. That’s all.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.

        Subsequently a series of investigation

statements were recorded from him. In a statement recorded on 23 August,<sup>14</sup>

Isnin said that in the morning of the day of arrest he received a telephone call from

Ruzaini. Ruzaini said he needed his help, which he understood to be to pack drugs. That

afternoon Azman also called him. Azman asked if he was going to "the place" and

said Ruzaini would be there, but he did not name the place. Isnin decided to check with a

friend he called Brother who had instructed him to send food and provisions to the

apartment as well as to pack drugs there on earlier occasions. When he telephoned Brother,

he was told to buy some drinks to the apartment and to pack drugs. (In a subsequent

statement he added that Brother did not inform him of the amount of the drugs or their

whereabouts.<sup>15</sup>) He carried out Brother’s instructions. He bought some

drinks and went to Cascadale condominium. He took the keys to the apartment from the

letter box and entered the apartment at about 2.45 pm. There was no one there. He went to

the master bedroom and saw some heroin on the floor and a bowl of heroin. He settled down

and started to pack the heroin. About half an hour later, he heard some noise outside the

apartment’s main door and saw some men outside. He placed a chair against the door to

prevent it from being opened, and tried to dispose of the sachets of heroin into the

toilet bowl. His efforts were futile because the officers entered the apartment, and

arrested him. He only knew about the drugs in the master bedroom, and did not know of the

other drugs recovered in the apartment. The drugs did not belong to him, and he did not

know if they belonged to Azman or Ruzaini.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.

        In a statement made on 27 August<sup>16</sup>

Isnin explained that he had been to the apartment on other occasions prior to his arrest.

On the first occasion, about two weeks earlier, he brought provisions and a mini-compo

sound system there on Brother’s instructions. When he arrived at the apartment

Ruzaini and his girlfriend (whose name is Rohaizan or Rose) were at the apartment. He

deposited the things he brought, and left without packing any drugs. Two or three days

later he went to the apartment again on the instructions of Brother who had told him to

pack drugs. On this occasion he gained entry with keys taken from the letter box. There

was no one else there. He packed 50 sachets of heroin in the master bedroom and left. On

16 August, the day before his arrest, Brother instructed him to pack drugs in the

apartment again. On this occasion, Ruzaini let him in. Azman was also there, and the three

of them packed drugs together.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.

        In a further statement dated 29 August,<sup>17</sup>

he stated that he had gone to the apartment three times to pack drugs. When he was there

alone in the apartment to pack drugs on the first occasion he checked some areas of the

apartment, in the course of which he touched the ceiling of the kitchen, the kitchen

toilet and the master bedroom toilet for drugs, but he did not find any drugs.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.

        In his next investigation statement of 5

September,<sup>19</sup> Isnin described Brother as an Indian Muslim and his mobile phone

number is 90223824. When he was shown the photograph of Ismadi bin Kasban (the subscriber

of telephone 90223824), he responded that he did not know that person or his name.<sup>20</sup></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Other evidence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.

        There was other evidence adduced by the

prosecution which formed part of the whole case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.

        <i>Fingerprints. </i>Fingerprints were found on

the false ceiling boards of the master bedroom toilet and the kitchen toilet false ceiling

where the 23 and 20 packets of heroin were concealed. When the prints were examined the

fingerprint on the false ceiling board of the master bedroom toilet was ascertained to be

Isnin’s, and that on the false ceiling board of the kitchen toilet was Azman’s.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.

        <i>Rohaizan binte Buang’s evidence. </i>She

is the girlfriend of Ruzaini and is also known as Rose. In her statement admitted in

evidence,<sup>21</sup> she stated that in late July 2001 Ruzaini had asked her to rent an

apartment for him to stay with his friends. She saw an advertisement of the apartment, and

on 24 July<sup>22</sup> they went to view it. She took up the tenancy and paid the deposit

and rental with money provided by Ruzaini. When she received the apartment keys she handed

them to Ruzaini. A few days later she went to the apartment. Ruzaini who was there alone

told her that his friend was staying in the master bedroom. When she visited him next,

Azman was in the living room, and Ruzaini informed her that Azman was staying there.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.

        Azman’s counsel did not dispute her

assertion that Azman was at the apartment with Ruzaini. Ruzaini’s counsel did not

dispute her evidence that Ruzaini had told her that he wanted to rent the apartment for

him and his friends to stay in or put to her that Ruzaini told her that he was renting the

apartment on behalf of a friend.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.

        <i>Identity of Brother. </i>The investigation

officer ascertained that the telephone number 90223824 which Azman and Isnin stated to be

Brother’s telephone number was subscribed by someone by the name of Ismadi bin

Kasban. He obtained this person’s photograph from the national registration

authorities and showed it to all three accused persons. Each of them said that it was not

the photograph of Brother.<sup>23</sup> Brother was described differently by each of them.

Azman described the Brother he knew as a Malaysian Malay, whereas the Brother Isnin dealt

with is an Indian Muslim, and according to Ruzaini, Brother is a Malaysian Chinese Muslim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.

        The investigation officer did not contact

Ismadi bin Kasban or arrange for his statement to be taken. He felt that this was not

necessary because he was not identified by the three accused and because their

descriptions of Brother differed. He could have done more. Ismadi bin Kasban could have

shed light on the shadowy Brother. He could confirm if he was known as Brother, and if he

knew any of the accused. If he was in possession of the mobile phone, he could explain the

calls with the accused. If he was not in possession of the phone, he may identify the

person who did. The investigation officer was right in concluding that the three

accuseds’ descriptions of Brother and their failure to identify Ismadi bin

Kasban’s photograph were unsatisfactory. That was cause for further investigations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.

        There was evidence adduced on the newspaper

used to wrap the packets of drugs, the call tracing records of the accuseds’

telephones. However this evidence did not really add to the case for the prosecution or

the defence.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Close of the prosecution case</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.

        The evidence against Azman was that he was at

the apartment before going to Kranji MRT station. He had the keys to the apartment, and by

s.18(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act he was presumed to be in possession of the drugs in the

apartment. His fingerprint was on the ceiling board of the kitchen toilet. There was also

Isnin’s statement that he was packing drugs at the apartment on the day before (16

August).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.

        For Ruzaini, the evidence was that he rented

the apartment through Rohaizan, and had received the apartment keys. There was

Isnin’s statement that he was in the apartment after the keys were delivered to him,

and that he was there on 16 August packing drugs. Isnin had also stated that Ruzaini

telephoned him on 17 August and asked for help, which he understood to mean help to pack

drugs. Azman had stated that he was going to Cascadale condominium to deliver the bag he

collected from Kranji MRT station to someone waiting for him there and Ruzaini had stated

in his statement that he was waiting for Azman when he was arrested.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.

        Lastly, for Isnin, he had the keys to the

apartment, his fingerprint was on the false ceiling board on the master bedroom toilet

where 23 packets of heroin were concealed, and he admitted to packing drugs in the

apartment before and on the day of his arrest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.

        I found that a reasonable inference can be

drawn that the three of them were in possession of the drugs in the apartment for the

purpose of trafficking. That was sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for the

accused to be called on to enter their defences – see <i>Tan Chuan Ten v PP</i>
<nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 348</nobr> at para 25.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Azman’s defence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.

        On 17 August he received a call from his friend

Brother who is a Malaysian Malay.<sup>24</sup> Brother wanted him to collect VCDs for him

from Kranji. Brother’s instructions were that he was to go to Cascadale condominium

first to collect the money for the VCDs from apartment #02-02. He did not know where

Cascadale condominium and the apartment were and Brother gave him the directions.<sup>25</sup>

He went to Cascadale condominium, collected the keys to the apartment from the letter box

and gained access to the apartment. He went to a bedroom and took the money which was

about $40,000. After taking the money, he went to the kitchen and had a drink and then to

the kitchen toilet to urinate. While he was there he noticed the false ceiling opening was

slightly open, and he raised himself on the toilet bowl and closed it. He went to the

living room, smoked some heroin, then left the apartment for Kranji MRT station by taxi.

On the way there Brother called. Brother instructed him not to pay the money to the person

delivering the VCDs. He was to return to Cascadale condominium after collecting the VCDs

and someone will be waiting for him, and he was to hand the money, keys and bag of VCDs to

this person. He went to Kranji MRT station, received a bag from a man there and proceeded

to bring it back to Cascadale condominium. He presumed the contents to be VCDs because in

a similar transaction two weeks earlier, they were VCDs.<sup>26</sup> His trip was

disrupted by the CNB officers who arrested him. He added by way of clarification that when

he told Insp. Herman about Sam, he was referring to Brother as he knew him by both names.<sup>27</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.

        Azman admitted that he knew Ruzaini and Isnin

and was in regular contact with them over the telephone when they would talk about

football.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.

        Under cross-examination Azman said that he had

not been to the apartment prior to the date of arrest. He confirmed that Brother had given

him his telephone numbers, 90223824<sup>28</sup> and 97865007.<sup>29</sup> He denied

Isnin’s counsel’s assertion that he and Ruzaini were there on 16 August packing

drugs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.

        The prosecutor asked him why he had stated in

his statement of 29 August<sup>30</sup> that he did not have the contact number of

Brother. His explanation was that he could not remember the number as he had entered them

into his mobile phone.<sup>31</sup> He claimed that he had told several CNB officers

including Insp. Herman, that Brother’s contact number was in the mobile phone.<sup>32</sup>

(This was not put to any of the officers, none of whom had mentioned this in his

evidence.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.

        On further cross-examination by the prosecutor,

Azman admitted that he stated in his investigation statement dated 12 September that

Brother had instructed him on 17 August that after collecting the bag, he was to telephone

someone called Boy and to deliver the bag to him.<sup>33</sup> Azman also admitted that

Boy was Ruzaini.<sup>34</sup> When asked why he did not say that in court, Azman explained

that he had made that up because he suspected Ruzaini as they had intended to go out

together that day, and he was confused after his arrest.<sup>35</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.

        Azman also agreed with the prosecution that

when he was arrested, he knew that the officers were CNB officers.<sup>36</sup> He was

asked why he told them he did not know what was in the bag, when he thought he was

collecting VCDs, his answer was he was in shock.<sup>37</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.

        Lastly, Azman admitted when he was asked about

the fingerprint on the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet, he denied that he touched it.<sup>38</sup>

His explanation for this was that he was in shock when he said that on 30 August.<sup>39</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.

        The prosecutor confronted him with another part

of that statement<sup>40</sup> where he said he did not call Isnin on 17 August between

1-2 pm, contrary to his evidence in court that he had called Isnin.<sup>41</sup> His

explanation was that he lied because he did not know if Isnin was involved with the drugs

and did not want to commit himself either way.<sup>42</sup></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Ruzaini’s defence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.

        Ruzaini explained his involvement with the

apartment. The apartment was rented for a Malaysian Chinese Muslim friend Brother, who

wanted his help to rent an apartment. He in turn told Rohaizan that Brother needed his

help to rent an apartment.<sup>43</sup> (This did not come out in Rohaizan’s

evidence, and was not put to her by Ruzaini’s counsel.) When the apartment was

secured, Rohaizan handed the apartment keys to him<sup>44</sup> and he delivered them to

Brother’s girlfriend about a week later. During that week only Rohaizan had visited

him at the apartment.<sup>45</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.

        On 17 August he received a call that his

adopted mother was warded at the National University Hospital ("NUH"). He took a

shower and went directly to the hospital and reached there sometime after 11 am.<sup>46</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.

        At 9.45 am he telephoned Isnin and told him

that he needed his help.<sup>47</sup> He received a call from Azman at 2.49 pm.<sup>48</sup>

They agreed to go to Orchard Road together, and arranged to meet at Cascadale condominium

first. Sometime after 3 pm, he took a taxi from Tampines Mall to Cascadale condominium.

Azman was not there and did not answer his calls. About 5 minutes later the CNB officers

came and arrested him. They took him to the apartment. He did not have the keys to the

apartment on him and had no knowledge of or anything to do with the drugs found in the

apartment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.

        In answer to his counsel’s question,

Ruzaini said that he had called Isnin on the telephone that morning and asked Isnin for

his help with transport. (It was not put to Isnin that he was asked to help with

transport). He needed Isnin’s help to bring a few items of clothings to his adopted

mother. He denied that he was at the apartment with Isnin and Azman on 16 August. He

claimed that Isnin made those allegations against him because Isnin suspected that he was

a CNB informer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.

        In cross-examination by Azman’s counsel,

Ruzaini confirmed that he did not meet Azman on 16 August, that Azman had never visited

him at the apartment, and that he did not tell Rohaizan that Azman stayed at the

apartment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.

        In response to questions by counsel for Isnin,

Ruzaini said that Isnin had told him that he thought Ruzaini was a CNB informer while they

were at the Subordinate Courts lockup. (This was denied by Isnin.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.

        The prosecutor referred him to his

investigation statements where he said that he did not know Azman and Isnin. He agreed

this was untrue.<sup>49</sup> The prosecutor also asked him to explain why Rohaizan did

not say that he told her that the apartment was rented for Brother, and why it was not put

to her in cross-examination. His response was "I have nothing to say."<sup>50</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.

        The prosecutor also referred him to other parts

of his statements. In a statement dated 4 September<sup>51</sup> he said that Azman was

not the person who arranged to meet him at Cascadale condominium to go to Orchard Road

together. This was in direct contradiction with his evidence in court that they had

arranged to meet. Ruzaini’s explanation was that his evidence was correct and he made

the untrue statement because he was in shock and was confused,<sup>52</sup> more than two

weeks after he was arrested.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.

        He had also said in the statement that he had

known Azman for about 2 weeks whereas his evidence was that they first met much earlier,

in a drug rehabilitation centre, and then renewed their acquaintance in May/June 2001.

Again, he explained that the statement was wrong and was made while he was in shock and

confused.<sup>53</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.

        In the same statement<sup>54</sup> he stated

that he had not seen Isnin before although his evidence in court was that they had known

one another since 2000. Initially Ruzaini offered the same explanation – that the

statement was wrong because he was in shock and was confused when he made it, then he

admitted that he did not want to be involved with Isnin.<sup>55</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.

        In a later statement of 10 September,<sup>56</sup>

he stated that he did not know someone called Man. In court he admitted that Man was

Azman. In another part of the statement<sup>57</sup> he denied that he was known as Kecik

when in fact Isnin called him by that name<sup>58</sup> and he said that he had not heard

of Nin, when he knew Isnin by that name. The same reason were given for these

discrepancies, that he was in a state of shock.<sup>59</sup> In re-examination, he said

that "At that time I was in a state of shock. That’s why I lied."<sup>60</sup></font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Isnin’s defence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.

        He knew Azman and Ruzaini before their arrest.

He knew Brother, an Indian Muslim because they were from the same kampong. One month

before their arrest, they renewed their friendship. He agreed to help Brother by

delivering drinks, biscuits and other edibles to the apartment. Subsequently Brother

telephoned him, and gave him the address and told him that there was someone at the

apartment. He did as was instructed and took the items to the apartment. Ruzaini and

Rohaizan were there. He left the items at the apartment and left. Two or three days later,

Brother instructed him to take more food and a mini-compo sound system to the apartment.

He went to the apartment with those items, and again he met Ruzaini and Rohaizan at the

apartment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.

        He went to the apartment on a third occasion in

the beginning of August, for a different purpose. On this occasion, Brother asked for his

help to pack "a few packets" of drugs.<sup>61</sup> He did not elaborate on the

number or size of packets. Brother told him to collect the keys to the apartment from the

letter box and to get to pack the drugs in the master bedroom.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.

        He went to the apartment and he checked through

the apartment. He gave two reasons for doing that. The first was that when he saw the

drugs in the master bedroom, and became frightened because he had not seen such a large

quantity of drugs before. This lead him to check the whole apartment to ascertain if there

were more drugs.<sup>62</sup> The second reason was that Brother had asked him to check

the apartment for breakage and damage.<sup>63</sup> (It was not made clear why Brother

wanted him to check for breakage and damage on this visit and not the earlier visits.) So

he went through the apartment, including the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet, where he

removed the ceiling board to look at the concealed pipes, then he went to the master

bedroom and saw the drugs.<sup>64</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.

        There was an inconsistency in the two accounts

i.e., whether the search was done before or after he saw the drugs in the master bedroom.

In cross-examination he went on to say that he checked the kitchen and kitchen toilet

twice, before and after he saw the drugs.<sup>65</sup> In any event he did not find any

more drugs. But he was sufficiently concerned by what he saw that he called Brother, who

told him to continue packing. He packed the drugs into more than 50 sachets<sup>66</sup>

and left.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.

        His next visit was on 16 August. Brother called

him to go to the apartment and pack drugs again. On this occasion Ruzaini and Azman were

there before him, and they packed drugs into 80-150 sachets.<sup>67</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55.

        On 17 August (the day of arrest) Ruzaini called

him at about 9.45 am. Ruzaini told him that his mother was at NUH, and that he needed his

help. He understood that to mean that Ruzaini wanted his help to pack drugs. It was not

put to him that Ruzaini told him he needed help with transport.<sup>68</sup> In the

afternoon Azman also called to tell him that he and Ruzaini would be going to "that

place" and asked if he was going. Azman called him again later in the day and told

him that Brother wanted him to go to "that place". He called Brother and was

told to bring drinks and titbits to the apartment, get the keys from the letter box to

gain entry and pack drugs.<sup>69</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56.

        He did as he was told. While he was packing

drugs, the CNB officers raided the apartment. He tried to flush the drugs down the toilet

bowl, but was arrested before he completed that. He did not suspect that Ruzaini was a CNB

informer<sup>70</sup> and had not accused him of being that,<sup>71</sup> and had told the

truth in his investigation statements.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Evaluation of the evidence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.

        When Azman was arrested, he had the keys to the

apartment on him. He had collected the bag containing 30 packets of heroin, and was going

to deliver it to someone at Cascadale condominium. Inside the apartment his fingerprint

was found on the kitchen ceiling where 20 packets of heroin were hidden. There was

Isnin’s evidence that he was at the apartment on 16 August packing drugs, and that he

gave instructions to Isnin which the latter understood were for him to go and pack drugs

there on 17 August.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.

        He claimed that he did not know anything about

the drugs he collected, or those found in the house. However his conduct after his arrest

and his account of the events raised serious questions over his credibility. He admitted

that he told many falsehoods in his investigation statements in the weeks after his arrest

because he was in shock and that he lied to distance himself from Ruzaini and Isnin.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.

        His evidence was that he believed the bag he

collected contained VCDs, but when he was questioned, he did not say that they were VCDs,

but claimed ignorance instead.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.

        When he was questioned about the apartment, he

said that Sam had asked him to collect them, and that he had taken the apartment keys from

inside the plants in front of the house.<sup>72</sup> There were no plants hiding the keys

and that was changed to the letter box. In his defence, the instructions came from

Brother, who is the same person he had earlier referred to only as Sam.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.

        I did not accept his explanation for his

fingerprint on the kitchen toilet false ceiling. During the investigations, he

specifically denied touching it.<sup>73</sup> I did not accept his explanation that he put

his hand on the ceiling board to put it in its proper position. He was at the apartment to

collect the money to pay for the bag he was to collect at Kranji, not to do housekeeping.

If he had adjusted the ceiling board out of a sense of orderliness, there was no reason

why he should not mention it when he was asked about it during the investigation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.

        There was evidence which showed that Azman had

been to the apartment on previous occasions. Rohaizan said she saw him with Ruzaini when

she visited the apartment, and she was not challenged. Isnin testified that Azman was at

the apartment on 16 August 2001 packing drugs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.

        I rejected Azman’s defence that he had no

knowledge of the drugs in the flat, and had nothing to do with them. His evidence,

exemplified by his changing positions on the retrieval of the apartment keys, the

instructions from Sam, the false ceiling, whether he had been to the apartment before the

day of arrest was unsatisfactory and cannot be believed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.

        Ruzaini used Rohaizan to rent the apartment and

received the apartment keys from her. She saw him with Azman when she visited the flat.

Isnin had also stated that Ruzaini and Rohaizan were in the apartment when he brought food

and drinks there, and that Ruzaini and Azman were there with him on 16 August 2001 when

they packed drugs together. Isnin had also said that Ruzaini telephoned him on 17 August

2001 for his help, which he understood to be help to pack drugs in the apartment.

Ruzaini’s evidence was that he needed help to carry some clothes to his adopted

mother. He said that he had asked Isnin for help with transport, but that was not put to

Isnin. It was also not put to Isnin that he was wrong to think that the request was for

help to pack drugs when help was specifically sought for transport. When Isnin went to the

apartment and found the drugs, that confirmed his understanding that Ruzaini wanted his

help to pack drugs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.

        His explanation for renting the apartment did

not stand up to examination. He said that he rented it for Brother, and had told Rohaizan

that when they looked for the apartment. Rohaizan’s evidence was that he told her he

wanted an apartment for him to stay in with his friends. Her evidence was not disputed,

and it was not put to her that she was told that the apartment was rented for his friend.

Rohaizan’s unchallenged evidence that she had gone to the apartment to meet Ruzaini

on several occasions showed that he had more to do with the apartment than being

Brother’s proxy for renting it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66.

        His defence that he was waiting for Azman when

he was arrested. He said they arranged to meet at Cascadale condominium to go to Orchard

Road. This ran counter to Isnin’s evidence that Ruzaini had called him to help pack

drugs, and Azman told him that Azman and Ruzaini would be there.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.

        Isnin was arrested in the apartment while he

was packing drugs. By his own admission he had packed drugs there on two previous

occasions, once alone and once with Azman and Ruzaini. He had the keys to the apartment,

and his fingerprint was on the master bedroom false ceiling where 23 packets of heroin

were hidden.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.

        He knew that there was a lot of drugs in the

premises, enough to cause him to search the apartment and call Brother. His account of the

search was varied. Did he search because Brother told him to check for damage, or because

he saw the drugs, and did he search before he saw the drugs, or after, or both before and

after?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69.

        I accepted Isnin’s evidence that he, Azman

and Ruzaini were packing drugs in the apartment on 16 August as well as his evidence that

Ruzaini and Azman called him and spoke to him about going to the "place" on 17

August. He had already disclosed this in his investigation statements. Isnin was not

seeking any advantage for himself by making these admissions. He was not trying to shift

blame to Azman and Ruzaini or extricate himself, and was implicating himself instead.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70.

        The evidence before me was that after Ruzaini

obtained the keys to the apartment on 24 July, he was at the apartment, and Azman and

Isnin were also there. It was not innocuous presence. They were there together on 16

August to pack heroin, and 80-120 sachets of that were packed, obviously for the purpose

of trafficking. Azman and Isnin also left their fingerprints where the heroin was hidden.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71.

        Their involvement with the apartment and the

drugs there did not cease on 16 August. The packing of drugs was not completed. There was

more heroin to be packed. On 17 August each of them still had something to do with the

apartment. Azman was there before he went to collect the bag of 30 packets of heroin from

Kranji MRT station, and he was returning to the condominium with the bag. Ruzaini was at

the driveway of the condominium waiting for Azman. Isnin went to the apartment after

receiving calls from Ruzaini and Azman about going to the apartment, and was at the

apartment packing drugs when he was arrested.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72.

        When they were arrested the three of them were

still involved with packing drugs in the apartment. They were in possession of the drugs

in the apartment for the common intention of trafficking. I therefore found them guilty

and convicted them.</font></p>
