From around July 2013, RO Solutions paid the Appellant an additional sum of S$15,000 <span class="font-italic">per</span> month though the reason for these payments is disputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Appellant was also separately appointed as project manager for the MOPU BOSS1 Project from November 2013 to March 2014, the MODEC Project from November 2014 to June 2015, and the MOPU D18 Project from June 2015 to March 2016. In 2016, RO Solutions entered into a contract with Caevest Private Limited (“Caevest”) for a project (the “Caevest Project”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 1 July 2018, the Appellant resigned from his positions as engineering director at RO Solutions and managing director of ROSE. In Suit 626, he claimed for unpaid fees pertaining to certain projects against RO Solutions under the ROSE Agreement and sought relief as a minority shareholder of ROSE from the oppressive conduct of RO Solutions and Mr Lim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Judge allowed the Appellant’s minority oppression claim but dismissed all his other claims for unpaid fees. In relation to the Appellant’s claim for commission for the Caevest Project-, the Judge found that the Appellant had not initiated the Caevest Project within the meaning of cl 5.4 of the ROSE Agreement and was not entitled to be paid a commission (Judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [86] to [93]). In relation to the Appellant’s claim for compensation as the project manager of the MODEC Project, the Judge found that cl 5.5 of the ROSE Agreement required prior agreement for such remuneration and there was no such agreement made (Judgment<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [94] to [97]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In CA 101, the Appellant appeals against the Judge’s findings in relation to the Caevest Project and the MODEC Project. In our judgment, the Appellant’s appeal with regard to the Caevest Project has, for the reasons set out below, no merit and must be dismissed. However, we find that the Appellant is, for the reasons set out below, entitled to reasonable compensation for his work as project manager of the MODEC Project. We accordingly allow CA 101 in part. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9  Before turning to our decision on the Caevest Project and the MODEC Project, we address two preliminary issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 First, we make no order on HC/SUM 12/2022 (“SUM 12”), the Respondents’ application to strike out the Appellant’s Reply on the basis that the Appellant’s Reply was filed in contravention of O 56A r 9(7) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). At the outset, the plain language of O 56A r 9(7) of the ROC provides for when an appellant <span class="font-italic">must </span>file a reply. It does not state that the court must strike out an appellant’s reply if it takes the view that it was not required to be filed. This decision would be left to the discretion of the court to act in the best interests of the dispute and justice. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter </span>[2017] 2 SLR 185 at [22], the Court of Appeal made no order on a summons filed by the first respondent seeking to strike out the Appellant’s Reply for non-compliance with O 57 rr 9A(5A)–9A(5B) of the ROC because it was “inclined to consider the arguments raised in the reply in any event”. In this case, we consider it arguable that the respondents relied on arguments and/or evidence which were not clearly considered or relied on by the Judge. For instance, the Respondent’s Case made submissions on why the evidence of Mr Ernest Enver of Caevest and Mr Chia on the Caevest Project were contradictory.

While the Appellant seems to be under the impression that the Judge found that he “should not be entitled to any of his project claims because of his failure to ask for payment until the last day of his notice period”,

In our view, the Judge’s observations regarding the need for “some instrumentality in enabling RO Solutions to secure the Project” seems to have conflated the need for the Appellant to have <span class="font-italic">initiated</span> the project with the requirement for RO Solutions to have <span class="font-italic">secured</span> the project.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The word “initiate” in the context of cl 5.4 and in plain English means to begin or to start. We agree that the negotiating context shows that parties intended that the Appellant would need to expend some effort in order to bring in an introduction or referral such that he could be described as having “initiated” the new project. Unlike other contexts, in the context of the marine and offshore oil and gas industry in which the parties operated, there will be some process of validation by the counter party, which includes proof of relevant expertise, ability to secure the appropriate workforce, quality control and track record, before the project or contract will be awarded to them. Hence the reference in cl 5.4 to “initiated” and “securing” of the contract by the Company. We agree that this is illustrated by the Appellant and Mr Chia’s email discussion regarding whether BW Offshore (“BWO”) ought to be excluded for the purposes of commissions. The Appellant himself justified the inclusion of BWO by explaining that he had “many contacts in BWO” and BWO was a company he was very strongly focused on getting module work from. Even though they were a client, it would be difficult for RO Solutions to secure other module work without his help.

</div> This shows the parties’ expectation that some work was to be done by the Appellant to bring new clients to the table (or new work from existing clients) even though there was no express discussion of any threshold of effort. Clause 5.4 would not encompass a situation where the Appellant was merely a conduit for an already interested customer. It would not be commercially sensible for the Appellant to be paid significant sums of money in commissions if he was simply relaying an order from an already interested customer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In this case, the Appellant did not put in any effort to bring the Caevest Project to RO Solutions and cannot be considered to have “initiated” the Caevest Project.

</div> However, the evidence shows that this was not the reason for the Caevest Project. In April 2016, Mr Enver, Stuart Robinson (“Mr Robinson”) and Tony Compagnino, the three directors of Caevest, held a discussion on which company to engage as a subcontractor for the Caevest Project.

As it turned out, Tech Offshore went directly to make a bid to Saipem SA after we approached them. Then, Stuart Robinson went to approach another company, Sun Marine. Sun Marine did the same thing and went to bid directly with Saipem SA. Another company was a small company called Fab Tech. However, Stuart Robinson met the person in charge and said the person could not speak proper English and so did not have confidence in him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 Only subsequently, around 30 April 2016, Stuart Robinson <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">verbally told me in the office to call </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[the Appellant] to arrange for a meeting with ROS to discuss the possibility of [RO Solutions]</span> joining the Caevest Project. Consequently, on or about 30 April 2016 at around 4.00 PM, I called [the Appellant] on his personal mobile number to discuss the opportunity for [RO Solutions] to provide professional services for the Caevest Project. During the conversation, [the Appellant] expressed [RO Solutions’] interest in participating in the Caevest Project and asked that I send him an email with more details on the project so that he could refer the project to the relevant personnel(s) in [RO Solutions] who dealt with the type of work required for the Caevest Project.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is apparent that when Mr Enver suggested RO Solutions as a possible subcontractor for the Caevest Project, it was not because of any efforts on the part of the Appellant or because of the Appellant himself. On the contrary, it was only when he was asked if he had any contacts at RO Solutions did Mr Enver reply that he knew the Appellant. While it is true that Mr Enver later approached the Appellant as the point of contact to invite RO Solutions to participate in the Caevest Project after having been instructed to do so by Mr Robinson on 30 April 2016, this was only after Mr Robinson had already made the decision to approach RO Solutions since his approaches to two other companies were unsuccessful and ended in some level of grief for them. We agree with the Judge that Caevest’s decision to contact the Appellant was purely out of convenience since Mr Enver was acquainted with the Appellant. Mr Enver himself testified that the motivation to contact the Appellant was to “bypass” the “ding-donging, passing the chain” if he had contacted RO Solutions through the enquiry sales. We thus dismiss the Appellant’s claim for commission for the Caevest Project.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">MODEC Project</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 We find, with respect, that the Judge erred in her construction of cl 5.5 of the ROSE Agreement (as rectified by the Judge) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.5 Regarding compensation for managing &amp; executing of [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] any in-house work <span class="font-italic">for the ROS Group</span>, Appointee agrees not to charge any additional fee assuming he is billing for consulting work being performed directly by himself as per 5.3 above.

She noted that specific remuneration agreements were made between Mr Chia and the Appellant in relation to both the MOPU BOSS1 Project (which preceded the MODEC Project) and the MOPU D18 Project (which followed the MODEC Project). Yet, there was no agreement made for the MODEC Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Appellant submits that cl 5.5 of the ROSE Agreement does not require a separate agreement for entitlement to payment. Instead, cl 5.5 is itself the agreement for entitlement to payment for work done because it states that “reasonable compensation agreed by both parties <span class="font-italic">shall be paid </span>to [the Appellant]” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> In our view, the plain wording of cl 5.5 that “<span class="font-italic">reasonable compensation agreed by both parties shall be paid</span> to [the Appellant] to manage or execute this work” supports the Appellant’s submission. The clause envisages that should no consulting fees within the meaning of cl 5.3 be billed, the Appellant <span class="font-italic">shall </span>be paid reasonable compensation. What should be “agreed by both parties” is the quantum of compensation that is reasonable for each project. The use of “shall” provides for the entitlement to payment. Thus, even though there was no separate agreement for the Appellant’s remuneration for the MODEC Project, we find that he is entitled to reasonable compensation for his project management services for the MODEC Project under cl 5.5 of the ROSE Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 We reject the Respondents’ further point that the Appellant was compensated for his work on the MODEC Project by his $15,000 monthly payment from July 2013 to July 2018.

</div> In our view, his evidence at trial cohered better with the negotiations and the need for separate agreements for the MOPU BOSS1 Project and the MOPU D18 Project. If the Respondents’ case was to be believed that all the project management services were to be included within the $15,000 salary, there would have been no need for Mr Chia to persuade or convince the Appellant to be compensated via some other way (via ROSE for the MOPU BOSS1 Project) or not to be compensated (for the MOPU D18 Project). Mr Chia could have simply directed the Appellant to do the necessary because he was already being paid for it. Finally, this is supported by contemporaneous evidence in a letter dated 3 April 2018 from RO Solutions to the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority which states that the Appellant’s designation at RO Solutions was Engineering Director and his fixed salary was $15,000.
