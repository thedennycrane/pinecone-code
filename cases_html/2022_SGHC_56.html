</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The following principles from <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span> were also relevant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court should be extremely hesitant to punish litigants for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases, by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights: [24].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations: [26].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is a difference between an amendment that merely clarifies an issue in dispute and one that raises a totally different issue at too late a stage. To allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different defence: [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In this regard, I note that the defendant here is a corporate litigant. This was also the plaintiff’s first application to amend the SOC. Furthermore, the application was made at an early stage of the proceedings, long prior to trial. In the course of the oral hearing, the defendant referred me to <span class="font-italic">EA Apartments Pte Ltd v Tan Bek and others </span>[2017] 3 SLR 559 at [50], where the court held that it would not be just to allow the plaintiff a further opportunity to amend its pleadings given all the previous opportunity afforded to it. This was based on the guiding principle that the court has the power and responsibility to prevent abuses of process. However, these comments were made in the context of the plaintiff seeking another opportunity to rectify pleadings in further arguments, after the court had heard the initial application to amend and found that the draft amended SOC was defective. As such, I did not find this applicable to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant’s main objection was not that the proposed amendments would cause it injustice or injury which could not be adequately compensated by an appropriate costs order. Instead, the defendant’s objection to the proposed amendments was that the SOC was inherently defective and incapable of being cured by the proposed amendments.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Unfortunately, the bulk of the defendant’s submissions in this regard was based on a misunderstanding of the effect of the proposed amendments. The defendant did not address the fact that, through the proposed amendments, the plaintiff’s claim was no longer premised on the defendant being a guarantor for PT Brewin’s debts. By including Clause 3.1, which contains a direct undertaking from the defendant to the plaintiff, and including damages to be assessed as alternative relief, the plaintiff had now framed its claim as one of breach of a primary obligation owed to it by the defendant. In other words, a key part of the plaintiff’s case was no longer anchored on there being any form of a guarantee in the Deed. Any submissions made by the defendant which characterised the plaintiff’s claim as one based on a guarantee therefore did not address the effect of the proposed amendments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Under Clause 3.1 (see [8] above), there is clearly an obligation on the defendant as a Support Party to provide assistance and support to PT Brewin to ensure “Completion” by 31 March 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Certainly, Clause 3.1 does not render the defendant (as a Support Party) directly liable to the plaintiff for the specific sum of IDR 198,143,289,709 (or any portion of it), which is what PT Brewin allegedly owes the plaintiff under the Facility Agreement. In this respect, I agreed with the defendant’s submissions that the Deed does not make it a guarantor for PT Brewin’s debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 However, while the Deed may not make the defendant a guarantor, it does create obligations that are owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. For example, Clause 3.1 provides the plaintiff with a cause of action against the defendant where the defendant has failed to provide such assistance and support to ensure “Completion” by the set date. If the defendant is in breach of such obligations, the plaintiff has a claim against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In oral arguments, the defendant argued that there were insufficient particulars of any such alleged breach for it to found a reasonable cause of action. However, because the obligation in Clause 3.1 is for the defendant to provide “all necessary assistance and support to ensure that Completion will occur by 31 March 2020”, I found the simple fact, that Completion did not take place by then, to be sufficient particulars of the breach such that the claim was not obvious to be struck out. Of course, this finding does not preclude a future application for further and better particulars by the defendant, if necessary. Such an application would have to be separately assessed on its merits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In similar vein, I find that there could also be a reasonable cause of action in respect of the defendant’s alleged breach of Clause 3.3. Clause 3.3 imposes an obligation on the defendant to make available to PT Brewin additional equity contributions as necessary to enable PT Brewin to meet its interest payment obligations. PT Brewin did not meet its interest payment obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Accordingly, I found that the proposed amendments, particularly the inclusion of damages to be assessed as alternative relief, did “enable the real issues between the parties to be tried”, per <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman</span> at [6]. Taking into consideration <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span> at [106], I did not find this to be a situation where “it [was] obvious that the amended claim would be struck out at trial”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of the Homologation Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 At the hearing, counsel for the defendant recognized that there is an obligation under Clause 3.1, which could potentially provide the plaintiff with a cause of action. The defendant then argued that the plaintiff’s claim was inherently defective because of a judgment that had been obtained by PT Brewin in Indonesian restructuring proceedings, which deferred PT Brewin’s payment obligations under the Facility Agreement.

On 22 June 2021, judgment was given by a court in Indonesia to approve a composition agreement for PT Brewin (the “Homologation Judgment”). Pursuant to the Homologation Judgment, PT Brewin’s obligations as principal debtor under the Facility Agreement were deferred until 14 June 2024.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of Moh Rizah Khanafi at Tab 3-B. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The defendant made three arguments pertaining to the effect that the Homologation Judgment had on the plaintiff’s potential claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, the defendant argued that the deferment of PT Brewin’s payment obligations under the Homologation Judgment meant that the defendant’s secondary obligations to the plaintiff as guarantor fell away. However, as mentioned above, this argument does not address the plaintiff’s claim, taking into account the proposed amendments. I found that the proposed amendments gave the plaintiff a cause of action against the defendant that was not premised on the defendant being a guarantor for PT Brewin’s debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 To elaborate further, PT Brewin’s obligations as principal debtor to the plaintiff under the Facility Agreement are separate and distinct from the defendant’s obligations to the plaintiff under the Deed. Consequently, the obligations that were deferred pursuant to the Homologation Judgment and the obligations which the plaintiff now seeks to enforce under the Deed are very different:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Deed involves different parties from the Facility Agreement, which the Homologation Judgment relates to. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under the Deed, the obligations are primary obligations owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Under the Facility Agreement, the obligations are owed by PT Brewin to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The nature of the obligations under the Deed is also different from those under the Facility Agreement. PT Brewin’s obligations under the Facility Agreement relate to its repayment of the loan from the plaintiff. The Homologation Judgment only deals with such obligations. This is in contrast to the obligations under the Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For example, Clause 3.1 imposes an obligation on the defendant (and the other Support Parties) to provide all necessary support and assistance to ensure Completion by 31 March 2020. This obligation is wholly independent of PT Brewin’s repayment obligations. It therefore cannot be affected by the default of PT Brewin and the Homologation Judgment. If breached, it was breached at latest on 31 March 2020, which is long before the PKPU Proceedings even begun. Contrary to the defendant’s submissions, the obligation in Clause 3.1 is not contingent on there being debts presently due from PT Brewin to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, the defendant submitted that because of the Homologation Judgment, there is no loss to the plaintiff. This is because under the Homologation Judgment, PT Brewin’s obligations as principal debtor have only been deferred, and they remain owing to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As highlighted above, this fails to recognise that the obligations under the Homologation Judgment, which arise from the Facility Agreement, are distinct from the obligations under the Deed. In addition, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that there could have been loss suffered by the plaintiff arising from the defendant’s alleged breaches of the Deed. For example, this loss could include the cost incurred by the plaintiff in having to pursue the PKPU Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, the defendant submitted that the Homologation Judgment changed the obligations in prior contracts such as the Deed. However, as stated above at [30], any alleged breach of Clause 3.1 predates the PKPU Proceedings. I did not see how the Homologation Judgment could have retroactively changed whether a breach of Clause 3.1 had occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I therefore found that the Homologation Judgment did not affect the viability of the plaintiff’s cause of action under either Clause 3.1 or Clause 3.3, on the evidence before the court. I did not find it obvious that the action would be struck out because of the Homologation Judgment, per <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span> at [106].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The disallowed amendment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In contrast, I did not allow the plaintiff’s application to amend the original SOC to include an alternative claim for misrepresentation. This is because the plaintiff did not indicate in its revised pleadings any false representations of fact that were made. The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant’s promise to provide assistance and support to PT Brewin to ensure “Completion” amounted to a misrepresentation, because the defendant ultimately did not do so. However, this is not a false representation of fact that legally founds an action for misrepresentation. It is instead a claim based on a promise made and allegedly not delivered on. That is not misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [20]–[21].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As such, I did not allow this amendment per <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng </span>at [106] because it was obvious that the misrepresentation claim would be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For the reasons above, I allowed the plaintiff’s application in SUM 5043 to amend the SOC in part.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judicial Commissioner </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leo Cheng Suan, Lee Shu Xian and Teh Ee Don (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nawaz Kamil and Alston Yeong (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
