They have </span>three children namely (i) ‘B’ born in 2008; (ii) ‘C’ born in 2012 and (iii) ‘D’ born in 2013. CVB is 48 years of age and CVC is 39 years old. Currently, CVB is self-employed as a director of three car workshop companies after he was made redundant from his last employment with ‘XX’ Holdings Limited (‘XX’) in June 2021. CVC works as the Chief Corporate Officer and company secretary for ‘YY’ Healthcare Berhad, a listed Malaysian entity. She is also the Vice President for the ‘ZZ’ group.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 CVB instituted divorce proceedings in the Family Courts against CVC on 28 April 2017 <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> on the ground that CVC had behaved in such a way that CVB cannot reasonably be expected to live with her. On her part, CVC filed a defence and counterclaim for divorce based <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> on the same grounds as stated in CVB’s statement of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 9 May 2018, the Family Court granted an interim judgment (“the IJ”) on CVB’s statement of claim as well as on CVC’s defence and counterclaim. The issues relating to custody, care and control, access to and maintenance, of the children and division of matrimonial assets were adjourned to later dates to be dealt with by the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After many and protracted interlocutory proceedings in the Family Court that took place between the parties from 2018 to 2022, the ancillary matters relating to the children’s access and division of matrimonial assets finally came up for hearing before this court on 8 March 2022. Apart from the mandatory affidavits for ancillary proceedings, the parties filed no less than 21 affidavits after the IJ was granted. It would be well-nigh impossible to refer to all their affidavits as doing so would render these grounds of decision unnecessarily lengthy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The parties’ first affidavits of means (“AOM”) for the ancillaries hearing were filed on 14 February 2020 while their second AOM was filed on 30 June 2021 (by CVC) and on 30 July 2021 (by CVB). In the case of CVC, her first AOM contained exhibits that totalled 1,541 pages comprised in four thick volumes whilst her second AOM comprised of five thick volumes of exhibits that numbered 2,188 pages. The exhibits were an indiscriminate, expensive, wasteful and sometimes wholly unnecessary exercise. It was akin to throwing all manner of items into the kitchen sink and hoping that the drainer left in the sink (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the unfortunate court) would sift out and salvage some useful items.

CVB was more selective in his choice of exhibits which were still considerable. The second volume of his first and second AOMs consisted entirely of exhibits whilst his first volume in both AOMs consisted of the text as well as part of his exhibits. The parties filed their third AOM on 5 November 2021 followed by their fourth AOM on 20 December 2021. Both parties were obviously not constrained by cost considerations in their court battle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The hearing of the ancillary matters on 8 March 2022 could not be concluded within the day. Hearing resumed on 22 and 27 June 2022. On 27 June 2022, the court was informed that the parties had agreed that each party would retain his or her own assets.

However, some disbursements were awarded to CVB due to CVC’s unreasonable conduct in many instances, in particular, in maintaining that CVB had hidden assets worth $163m which allegation was found to be wholly unsubstantiated.

</div>, CVC still persisted in her allegation and submitted that $167,865,974.43 from CVB’s assets should be added to the matrimonial pool.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The court therefore awarded CVB $11,840 as reimbursement of half of the disbursements he had incurred (50% of $23,672.39 = $11,836.20 rounded up) as set out at para 12 of his Costs Submissions. Less the costs of $2,200 due to CVC on previous costs orders set out at para 20 of CVC’s Costs Submissions, CVC was ordered to pay CVB $9,640.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 CVC is unhappy with the orders made and has filed an appeal against the 27 June Orders and the Costs Order (in Civil Appeal No 68 of 2022) save for the orders made in respect of custody, care and control and access to the children as set out in [7] above. The court now sets out the reasons for the two sets of orders that were made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In their affidavits, the parties traded accusation against one another on many issues, in particular, over CVB’s access (or lack of access according to him) to the children. Each side further accused the other of either failing to disclose assets or dissipating known assets. Hence, the number of affidavits filed below largely related to applications and cross applications for discovery by the parties. In the case of CVC, she alleged that CVB had hidden away assets worth $163m (over and above the unfounded $10m cash allegation in [9]). CVB similarly accused CVC of hiding her assets. Had it not been for CVC’s allegation, the ancillaries hearing would have remained in the Family Courts instead of being transferred to the High Court, in the light of the parties’ relatively modest disclosed assets.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13  The parties had filed a voluminous joint summary of assets as at 7 March 2022. CVB quantified the parties’ joint assets as being worth $1,535,072.29, whereas CVC’s estimate was $1,266,325.94. Those figures were modified at the last hearing on 27 June 2022.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 CVB estimated his own assets as being worth $795,459 whereas CVC estimated they were worth $1,977,505.38. As for her own assets, CVC’s estimate was $578,969.10 whereas CVB stated that they were worth $1,477,375.03.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The joint matrimonial assets </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Bishan flat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Bishan flat was purchased for $758,000 in March 2013. There is a mortgage on the Bishan flat in favour of Maybank to secure a housing loan of $500,000 which as of 31 December 2019 had an outstanding sum of $180,971.74 (“the outstanding loan”). Based on SRX’s valuation obtained by CVB, the Bishan flat is valued at $741,000 as at 5 December 2019. CVC values the Bishan flat at $629,273.67 (the market value less the outstanding Maybank loan as at 14 May 2021).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The parties did not dispute the direct contributions they made towards the purchase of the Bishan flat. CVC paid the option fee of $5,000. CVB paid for the $17,340 in stamp and miscellaneous fees through his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account as well as $7,800 in agent’s fees. CVC paid $2,364.20 through her CPF contributions and issued two cashier’s orders for agency and legal fees of $9,475 and $1,391 respectively. The parties agreed that CVB contributed $105,000.20 towards the down-payment of the Bishan flat and CVC contributed $7,749.80 towards the down-payment and paid $129,384 to the vendors. They also agreed that CVB paid $252,287.21 and CVC paid $119,989.46 towards Maybank’s housing loan. Their total contributions were $382,427.41 for CVB and $275,353.46 for CVC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 CVB worked out his direct contributions as 79.46% and CVC’s contributions as 20.54% towards the flat. The net value of the Bishan flat is $560,028.26 ($741,000 less outstanding loan of $180,971.74). Using his percentage of 79.46%, CVB valued his share in the Bishan flat at $444,998.46 (79.46% x $560,028.26) and CVC’s share as $115,029.80 (20.54% x $560,028.26). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 CVC on the other hand valued the Bishan flat at $629,273.67 without providing any explanation or basis for the figure. She pegged her contributions as 42% and CVB’s contributions as 58%. According to her, her share is therefore $264,294.94 (42% x $629,273.67) and CVB’s share is $364,978.73 (58% x $629,273.67). On 22 June 2022, the court was informed that CVC had adopted and agreed to CVB’s value of $560,028.26 for the Bishan flat.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It should be noted that the Bishan flat has always been rented out and has never been occupied by the couple. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Malaysian properties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The couple jointly purchased two properties from Country Garden Danga Bay Sdn Bhd (“the developers”) situated at Danga Bay, Johor Bahru, on 30 December 2013 for investment purposes. The first unit at Block 11-A-1702 (“Malaysian property no 1”) was purchased for RM1,440,151 whilst the second unit at Block 12-A-3601 (“Malaysian property no 2”) was purchased for RM1,470,049.

For Malaysian property no 1, CVB paid S$198,820.06 and for Malaysian property no 2, he paid S$205,107.80. The amounts were more than 50% of the respective purchase prices. CVB said he asked CVC to pay her 50% share when the developers asked for further progress payments but she refused. This resulted in the developer forfeiting 20% of the progress payments he had made on or 8 May 2019, of S$96,654.43 for Malaysian property no 1 and S$98,661.01 for Malaysian property no 2, or a total sum of S$195,315.44. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 CVC asserted that the difference between the payments made by CVB and the sums forfeited by the developer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$154,881.31 and S$160,162.72 for Malaysian Property no 1 and no 2 respectively, should be put back into the pool of assets for division. She referred to a clause in the sale and purchase agreements that states the developer is contractually obliged to refund those sums. CVB disagreed as the developer to-date did not make any refunds despite reminders from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the light of the disagreement between the parties, the court directed at the first hearing on 8 March 2022, that CVB write to the developers which he did. CVB then filed an affidavit on 15 June 2022 confirming he did not receive any refund.

Apart from CVC’s contribution of $5,189.50 and $107, CVB contends he funded the entire cash portion of the purchase price of the shop unit. For the completion of the purchase, CVB paid $85,793.35 taken from the funds in CVC’s Citibank Account No XXXXXXXX04 which he contended came from the loan of $400,000 he had extended to CVC (which CVC disputes). He added that that the sum should be considered his direct contribution as it came from the redemption of unit trusts bought using his loan of $400,000.

What is in evidence is that CVC took the shop unit’s rental from April 2017 to 23 March 2020 amounting to $49,000. She diverted the rent to a different bank account from the CIMB account. After the IJ (9 May 2018), CVC continued to receive rental from the shop unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 CVB alleged that without his knowledge. CVC unilaterally closed the CIMB account around 29 January 2019. He further alleged that CVC “siphoned” $42,600 from the CIMB account on 11 April 2017 which she deposited into the Child Development Account (“CDA”) account of the youngest child ‘D’. As at 7 May 2018, the balance in the CIMB account was $3,697.68. CVB therefore asserts that $46,297.68 ($42,600 + $3,697.68) should be notionally added back to the pool of assets for division. CVB asserted that CVC is to also account for the rental proceeds that CVC continued to receive from the shop unit after the IJ, that was deposited into ‘D’’s CDA account. It should be noted at this stage that ‘B’ and ‘C’ also have CDA accounts opened by CVC. ‘B’’s CDA was closed on 31 January 2021

He pointed out that in AR Tan Zhi Xiang’s grounds of decision on CVC’s application for discovery in Summons No 1913 of 2020 in the court below, AR Tan made no order for discovery in relation to ‘JJ’ and AR Tan had also agreed that CVB is not a shareholder of ‘MM’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For purposes of division of the matrimonial assets, the Family Justice Court had on 4 September 2020 ordered that an independent valuation of the three car companies be conducted. This was carried out by the valuation company, Gao, whose letter of engagement was dated 15 October 2020. Gao was tasked to determine the fair market value of the three car companies as of 31 December 2018. Gao’s first report prepared by Ms Yak Chau Wei (“Ms Yak”) was dated 31 May 2021 (“Gao’s first report”) and exhibited in Ms Yak’s first affidavit filed on 23 June 2021. At the court’s behest, Ms Yak updated her report to 31 December 2021 by her second report dated 2 June 2022 (“Gao’s second report”) which she exhibited in her second affidavit filed on 13 June 2022.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In Gao’s first report, Ms Yak valued the three car companies at $1,194,389, In Gao’s second report, her valuation was $1,079,816 which represented a decrease of $114,573 from Gao’s first report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It should be noted that although Gao was the court-appointed valuer, CVB took it upon himself to appoint another firm of valuers to value the three car companies. He engaged Chay Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd (“Chay”) whose founder/CEO Mr Chay Yiowmin prepared two reports for CVB, the first dated 21 May 2021 and the second dated 29 July 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Chay’s first report was prepared to conduct an evaluation of Gao’s draft reports dated 2 February 2021 and 10 March 2021. He was highly critical of the two draft reports. Chay’s second report was to “evaluate the appropriateness of the final valuation report prepared by [Gao] and subsequently provide an indicative valuation on the three car workshops”

</div>, CVB explained at length why he sold his shares in BSP to Ms Ku. She is a woman of substantial means and a seasoned and savvy investor. He pointed out that only she would have the wherewithal to take over BSP (a heavily indebted company). BSP had entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 15 December 2009 (“the SPA”) to buy from ITC’s subsidiary, Macau Prime Property (China) Limited (“Macau Prime”), 92% of Newskill’s shares. BSP was required as the BIC in the SPA but failed to redevelop a piece of land in Guangzhou for a project company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Under the SPA, BSP undertook to but could not fulfil various undertakings in order to redevelop the Guangzhou land. In addition, BSP had to but could not demolish buildings, carry out resettlement and deliver vacant possession of the land to the project company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 BSP therefore undertook on 19 June 2015 to buy back from ITC 100% of Newskill’s issued share capital and shareholders’ loans for HK$595m. BSP had sold 92% of the shares in Newskill to ITC for HK$883.2m. ITC however retained HK$324.4m of the consideration as the local Chinese government in Guangzhou recovered the undeveloped land. Hence BSP sustained a loss in the entire transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 CVB added that BSP’s agreement with ITC required BSP to pay to ITC HK$200m in cash on completion. CVB did not have the means to do so. Hence his sale to Ms Ku of his shares in BSP for US$1.00 consideration. CVB pointed out (and which the court took into consideration) that he acquired his shares in BSP before his marriage and he disposed of them on 8 June 2015 before the marriage broke down.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As for the sum of RMB7.5m (mentioned above in [68]) that he allegedly forfeited from China Enterprise due to its failure to complete the MOU for his shares in Always Rich, CVB deposed

To allow them to keep playing when she knows that the Father [CVB] is waiting is not a good lesson in self-discipline and not a good example to set for the Children.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">153 She also undermines [CVB] by ignoring the time set for him by the Court. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">154 ‘B’ has admitted that she calls [CVB] “stupido” and makes fun of him “in mummy’ s house”. This is not something that should be encouraged or tolerated by [CVC] who should take an active role in disciplining the child and ensuring that the child is not rude to [CVB].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">155 Whatever [CVC’s] grievances are with [CVB], the child should know that she needs to respect her Father and cannot get away with calling him names. It is when this behaviour is tolerated that it is viewed as being encouraged and the child is then emboldened into thinking she can now choose how to live her life and whether she wants to see the Father or not. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">156 On Saturday nights when the Father attends to pick the Children up for his period of access, [CVC] should be actively exercising her authority to have the Children meet the Father instead of giving them the option of not going; or allowing them to believe that they do not have to go.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">158 The fact that the language and views of the 2 older Children are so similar with that of [CVC] shows that much of what they say and think is highly influenced by [CVC].  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">160 It is the CR’s belief that [CVC’s] failure to actively encourage the Children’s relationship with the Father has resulted – consciously or unconsciously, in what can be interpreted as alienating behaviour.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ms Parhar’s observations reflect poorly on CVC as a mother and her deplorable upbringing of ‘B’ – that her daughter has no respect for her father CVB.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 To elaborate on the court’s disapproval of CVC’s conduct, the court noted from the affidavit filed by CVB for Summons No 1695 of 2018 (“Sums 1695”) and Summons No 2221 of 2018 (“Sums 2221”) as well as his affidavit filed 24 August 2020 (which allegations the court accepts as true) and more importantly from Ms Parhar’s report, that CVC either denied CVB access or made access difficult for him. Sums 1695 and Sums 2221 filed on 17 May 2018 and 20 June 2018 respectively were CVB’s applications for leave to commit and committal proceedings against CVC. CVB cited as the basis for his application CVC’s breach of orders of court for his access to the children dated 28 September 2017 (“the 28 September order”) and 28 November 2017 (“collectively the two access orders”). The Family Justice Court (“FJC”) did not make any orders on 21 November 2018 for Sums 2221. At the first hearing, the court mistakenly thought that CVC was fined for her contempt of court but she was not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The omission of the FJC to punish CVC for her transgression of the two access orders, even with a fine, seemed to have emboldened her. She would have continued making it difficult for CVB to have access to the children had the court not reprimanded her in the strongest terms (see above at [134]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In Summons No 767 of 2018 (“Sums 767) filed on 2 March 2018, earlier than CVB’s committal applications in [135], CVC applied to stay or vary the two access orders even though the 28 September order was a consent order.

</div>, CVB offered to pay $500 as maintenance per child as being reasonable because the figure was in line with (i) the proportion of the parties’ average monthly income, and (ii) CVB’s estimate of the children’s reasonable monthly expenses. He submitted that no lump sum backdated maintenance should be awarded quite simply because CVC never made a claim for maintenance previously.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In his submissions, CVB cited the principles enunciated in <span class="font-italic">AMW v AMZ</span> [2011] 3 SLR 955 for the court in deciding whether to order backdated maintenance.

Further, CVB had indirectly contributed to the children’s maintenance from the rental of the shop unit which entire sum CVC took from May 2017 until present amounting to about $63,037.90. She had also taken $42,600 from the company’s CIMB account in 2017 without CVB’s knowledge. As a 50% owner of the company, CVB was entitled to 50% of the monies CVC took.

</div> He added that even if he were able to find employment that pays him his last drawn salary from ‘XX’ of $18,111.08 per month, it would take him more than three years to repay the backdated sum claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The court decided that no backdated maintenance would be ordered as CVC failed to explain or give good reasons for her omission in not applying for interim maintenance for five years (see <span class="font-italic">AXM v AXO</span> [2014] 2 SLR 705). The court also noted that CVC collected rent from a lady called Penny who stayed at the Bishan flat between September 2013 and March 2017 as well as from Calvin (who moved there in September 2013) from October 2013 to March/April 2017. CVC claimed she used the rental to cover ‘C’’s and ‘D’’s school fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It is not in dispute that CVC earns considerably more than CVB and should therefore shoulder a higher proportion of the maintenance sums. CVB’s income from the workshop business is also unpredictable/uncertain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 CVC provided constantly changing figures for her income as well for the children’s maintenance prior to the agreed sums totalling $7,797.71. The court decided to adopt a pragmatic approach on the proportion of maintenance each party should bear for the children, based on their income/earning capacity as well as the reasonable needs of the children of the ages that ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ were at. The court rejected CVB’s offer of $500 per child per month as it was inadequate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) sets out the factors to be considered in the determination of maintenance for children:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may order maintenance of wife, incapacitated husband and children</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife, an incapacitated husband or a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the financial needs of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any physical or mental disability of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) the standard of living enjoyed —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) by the wife before her husband neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) by the incapacitated husband before his wife neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for him; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In regard to s 69(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter, the court is mindful that CVC earns more than three times what CVB can earn from the workshop businesses every month.

It would also serve as a reality check on her to expend moneys only on the children’s actual <span class="font-italic">needs </span>based on their ages as against what she or they <span class="font-italic">desire.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Consequently, the court ordered CVB to pay maintenance of $900 per child from 1 July 2022 up to 30 June 2023, and thereafter the sums would increase to $1,200 per child per month.

If the children’s agreed monthly expenses total $7,797.71 (see above at [145]) and CVB pays $2,700 as his share, the balance of $5,097.71 would roughly equate to 24% of CVC’s monthly income of $21,000 (rounded down from CBV’s figure of $21,673.42 and considerably less than her own figure of $35,362.75 for 2020 – see [144] above). After one year, CVB’s maintenance obligation of $3,600 in total per month would amount to 60% of his monthly income. The court hopes that the workshop businesses would have improved by then (or CVB found gainful employment at a higher salary than $6,000) while CVC’s liability would decrease to 20% of her income ($7,797.71 less $3,600 = $4,197.71÷ $21,000).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Costs Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The court had already touched on the issue of costs previously (see above at [8]–[9]).

Apparently, in requesting the court to appoint Gao as the valuer of the workshop businesses, CVC had given a figure of $40,000 as Gao’s fees. However, it transpired Gao’s fees were time-based. The parties had to pay an additional $14,049.56 over and above the $40,000 expected. CVB asked CVC for reimbursement of half thereof amounting to $7,024.78 due to his being misled by her. He also claimed that the inaccuracies in Gao’s report necessitated and culminated in the issuance of Chay’s second report dated 29 July 2021. Hence. CVB wanted CVC to pay $39,400 being the cost of Chay’s first ($9,200) and second ($30,200) reports. The court declined as the court had already rejected Chay’s reports (see above at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In his Costs submissions, CVB complained of CVC’s spurious claims
