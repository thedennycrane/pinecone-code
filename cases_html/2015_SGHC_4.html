<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a case where controlled drugs, concealed
                    in a luggage bag, were brought from Nigeria to Singapore for delivery to
                    Malaysia <em>via</em> the Woodlands Causeway. The evidence
                    established that the luggage bag was brought into Singapore by the second
                    accused, Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi (“Ilechukwu”), a 29 year
                    old Nigerian male, and handed over to the first accused, Hamidah Binte Awang
                    (“Hamidah”), a 49 year old Singaporean female, to be delivered
                    into Malaysia. The issue was whether they had knowledge of the drugs concealed
                    in the luggage bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Hamidah was charged with attempting to export
                    not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine, an offence under s 7 read with
                    s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“MDA”), punishable under s 33 or s 33B of the MDA.
                    Ilechukwu was charged with trafficking by giving to Hamidah not less than
                    1,963.3g of methamphetamine, an offence under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA, punishable under s 33 or s 33B of the
                    MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Both Hamidah and Ilechukwu claimed trial. At the
                    end of the trial, I convicted Hamidah and acquitted Ilechukwu. I now give my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s case </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 13 November 2011, Ilechukwu flew
                    from Lagos, Nigeria to Singapore. He had checked in a black luggage bag bearing
                    a logo which reads “Star Express” (“the Black
                        Luggage”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Upon his
                    arrival in Singapore, Ilechukwu collected the Black Luggage from the luggage
                    belt and eventually made his way to Hotel 81, Chinatown at 8.36pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> At 10.16pm, Ilechukwu
                    left the hotel with the Black Luggage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He met Hamidah and handed her the Black
                        Luggage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Hamidah placed
                    the Black Luggage in the boot of her car and eventually made her way to the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the Woodlands Checkpoint, Hamidah was stopped
                    and her car was searched.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    The Black Luggage was cut open at the sides and two packets of crystalline
                    substance wrapped in brown packaging were recovered (exhibited and marked P3 and
                        P4).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Hamidah was
                    then arrested. The next morning, Ilechukwu was arrested in his room at Hotel 81,
                    Chinatown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The two packets of crystalline substance marked
                    A1 and A2 were subsequently analysed by the Health Sciences Authority. The
                    analysis revealed that A1 contained not less than 980.2g of methamphetamine and
                    A2 contained not less than 983.1g of methamphetamine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, adding to a total of
                    not less than 1963.3g of methamphetamine (“the
                Drugs”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Hamidah did not dispute that she was, at the
                    time of her arrest, in control and possession of the Black Luggage in which the
                    Drugs were found.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, she denied knowledge of the Drugs in
                    the Black Luggage. Ilechukwu similarly denied knowledge. Since Hamidah and
                    Ilechukwu had the Black Luggage in their possession at the material time, by
                    virtue of s 18(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA, the Drugs
                    were presumed to have been in their possession at those times. Pursuant to
                    s 18(2) of the MDA, they were also presumed, until the contrary was proven,
                    to have known the nature of the Drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The crux of the case, therefore, was whether
                    Hamidah and Ilechukwu could prove on a balance of probability that each of them
                    did not know about the Drugs: <em>Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<em>Nagaenthran</em>”) at [23]–[24] and [31]. The
                    prosecution took the position that both Hamidah and Ilechukwu had not rebutted
                    the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. I now turn to their
                    respective cases and my reasons, starting with Hamidah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for Hamidah’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Hamidah’s case was essentially one of
                    trust and betrayal. Her evidence was that she did not know that the Black
                    Luggage contained the Drugs. She was asked by her lover, Bengoodman Chukwunonso
                    (“Bengoodman”), whom she trusted, to deliver a piece of luggage to
                    him in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He told her that it contained two Nigerian
                    passports. Hamidah added that when she received the Black Luggage, she had
                    checked to make sure that it did not contain any drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I found that Hamidah had not rebutted the
                    presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Hamidah’s defence did not
                        paint a consistent story; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hamidah’s behaviour at the time of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I will elaborate on my reasons
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Hamidah’s inconsistent defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Amolat Singh (“Mr Singh”),
                    counsel for Hamidah, argued that she was a “simpleton” who had
                    been tricked by her lover, Bengoodman. Hamidah’s evidence was that she had
                    met Bengoodman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and eventually became intimately
                    involved with him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> To support this, Mr Singh highlighted the phone
                    records and in particular the short messaging service (“SMS”)
                    message sent by Hamidah to Bengoodman, a few days before the date of her arrest,
                    on 11 November 2011, which reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bengood men you never change since i no you i no you always make me like a
                        fool i thank you for tat i test you so many things wat i can see you dont
                        really luv me i no you are married <em>i dont no why i still
                            luv you</em> ben all the money tat you gv is for my debt not tat i

                        again so left everything to GOD hands thank you ben [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     While this is evidence that Hamidah has had an
                    intimate relationship with Bengoodman, it is equivocal as to whether she trusted
                    him at the material time. The message contains expressions of disappointment and
                    betrayal, and it is not clear from her evidence whether their relationship had,
                    by 13 November 2011, been restored to the level that she would trust
                    that he would not put her in harm’s way. The evidence would suggest that
                    Hamidah was infatuated with Bengoodman, but that could also mean that she was
                    willing to transport drugs for Bengoodman to prove her affection for
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     More importantly, Hamidah had given evidence
                    which would indicate that she did not believe that Bengoodman would never use
                    her to transport drugs. Her assessment of Bengoodman in court suggested that she
                    could not have believed that Bengoodman would not harm her. Hamidah admitted
                    during cross-examination that she knew very little about Bengoodman,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and
                    that she did not trust him completely.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Among other
                    things, Hamidah accepted that she knew that Bengoodman cheated women of their
                        money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It was also apparent from the SMS message
                    dated 11 November 2011 ([11] above) that she had doubts about whether Bengoodman
                    actually loved her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Further evidence of distrust is found in
                    certain aspects of Hamidah’s conduct. Hamidah gave evidence that she had
                    checked the Black Luggage for drugs when Ilechukwu handed it to her, as advised
                    by her Nigerian fiancé, Simwuba Samuel (“Samuel”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It was also
                    revealed during the trial that she had previously delivered a luggage, said to
                    contain “traditional Nigerian clothes”, to Bengoodman in Malaysia
                    ([16] below). Hamidah’s evidence was that she had also checked the
                    contents of the luggage for drugs on that occasion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> This
                    would be inconsistent with Hamidah’s case that she had trusted Bengoodman
                    and genuinely believed that he would not have used her to transport drugs. On
                    the contrary, if these checks were made, it would be precisely because Hamidah
                    did not trust or believe Bengoodman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     If Hamidah had been the trusting simpleton
                    that Mr Singh had submitted, it is puzzling that she did not show any sign of
                    shock or disbelief when the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
                    (“ICA”) officers at Woodlands Checkpoint cut the Black Luggage and
                    took out the Drugs in her presence. There was no evidence from her or from any
                    of the officers present that she had reacted in this manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Hamidah also described an earlier delivery.
                    About one or two months before Hamidah was arrested, Bengoodman had asked her to
                    pick up a bag of “traditional Nigerian clothes” from a couple who
                    had just arrived in Singapore and deliver it to him in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> As she was planning to visit her mother in
                    Malaysia, Hamidah said that she agreed to help Bengoodman “as a favour
                    for a friend”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> She got the contact details of the couple from
                    Bengoodman and met them at the lobby of Hotel 81, Geylang.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Hamidah’s evidence was that she
                    had requested to see the contents of the bag to make sure that the bag did not
                    contain “drugs or anything illegal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> She then delivered the bag to Bengoodman at his
                    condominium in Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After this first delivery, Bengoodman again
                    contacted Hamidah on 2 November 2011. Hamidah received two SMS
                    messages from Bengoodman in the wee hours of the morning:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Hamidah did not talk about this incident in
                    her statements. At trial, she explained that Bengoodman had asked her to meet a
                        person.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Hamidah’s evidence was that
                    Bengoodman gave her the contact details but did not tell her the reason for
                    which she was supposed to meet the person.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Bengoodman
                    told Hamidah that the person’s name was “Usman” but a lady
                    answered when she called the number.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> She hung up and
                    related this to Bengoodman. Bengoodman then gave her the name of Hajia Memuna
                        (“Hajia”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Hamidah said
                    that the meeting did not happen because Hajia was supposed to meet a person with
                    a young child and Hamidah did not have one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Hamidah said that she did not know why she was
                    asked to meet Hajia but she made the calls because she was curious.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> At the trial, she explained
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, at first, Ben Goodman---<em>at that time,

                        the hotel the person is staying. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Later, while Hamidah was explaining why she
                    did not eventually meet up with Hajia, she said that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This person says that <em>she has to give to a person who

                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There were clear indications that
                    Bengoodman’s requests were not simple deliveries. Hamidah, on her own
                    evidence, asked to check the luggage in the first delivery for drugs ([16]
                    above). It was also strange that Bengoodman had made his second request in the
                    wee hours of the morning and refused to tell Hamidah what was the item that she
                    was supposed to collect ([17]-[18] above). As for the third request, Hamidah
                    decided not to use her real name but chose to use her alias,
                        “Maria”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the delivery was supposed to be
                    given tosomeone who was carrying a young child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> If Hamidah had
                    no inkling of any illegality, these circumstances would have aroused her
                    suspicions. Contrary to Mr Singh’s contention,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> and
                    unlike in <em>Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011]
                    3 SLR 201 (see [23]–[28] of the judgment), there was no consistent pattern
                    of conduct which induced Hamidah into believing that she was not delivering
                    drugs for Bengoodman. Rather, the evidence showed that Hamidah was suspicious of
                    Bengoodman on the occasions that she helped him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 13 November 2011, Bengoodman made
                    his fourth and final request. He informed Hamidah that someone was coming to
                    Singapore and asked her to collect from that person a luggage which would
                    contain clothes and two passports.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> According to
                    Hamidah, she initially refused but Bengoodman managed to convince
                        her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Bengoodman told her that the passports were
                    hidden inside the clothes and explained that it was meant for two of his
                    Nigerian friends whose passports had expired.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    Hamidah was supposed to collect the luggage and deliver it to Bengoodman in
                        Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> This was the Black Luggage that was in
                    Hamidah’s possession when she was arrested at the Woodlands
                    Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In Hamidah’s statements, it was recorded
                    that Bengoodman had promised to pay her RM1000 for the delivery:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Statement
                        dated 17 November 2011:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">... I am now asked why I had agreed to help him despite knowing
                                that I would be doing something illegal. I agreed to help him
                                because I was on the way to Malaysia to meet my mother so I agreed
                                to do him a favour. Furthermore, he had offered to give me RM1000 as
                                transport money. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At the trial, Hamidah shifted from the
                    position taken in her statements and claimed that Bengoodman was only joking
                    when he offered to give Hamidah the sum of RM1000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Her evidence
                    was that she was not doing it for the money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> She also alleged
                    that she did not take Bengoodman’s offer seriously as he owed her S$2000
                    which he had yet to repay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> However, the
                    alleged debt was not mentioned in her statements. Instead, she stated on two
                    occasions that Bengoodman had promised her RM1000 for the
                delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Hamidah was cross-examined by the prosecution
                    on this point, and was referred to her SMS message to Bengoodman dated
                    11 November 2011 ([11] above). The relevant part of the SMS message
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... all the money tat you gv is for my debt not tat i use to enjoy myself
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Hamidah agreed that the SMS message showed
                    that Bengoodman was giving her money but she explained that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yes, because he owed ---he owed me. It is very difficult to ask back for
                        money if they had owed us. We have to portray that we are in debt and we
                        need the money, that’s how they would give us the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before Hamidah met Ilechukwu to collect the
                    Black Luggage, she called her fiancé, Samuel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> She told Samuel that she was helping
                    Bengoodman deliver a luggage to Malaysia, and was advised by Samuel to check the
                    luggage to see if it contained drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>
                    Hamidah explained that Samuel had advised her to check because he, being a
                    Nigerian, was aware that some Nigerians were involved in drug
                        activities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Indeed, Hamidah said
                    that she shared the same concern; in her statement she said that she told Samuel
                    that she felt “very scared” and that she will decide whether to
                    help Bengoodman with the delivery later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Hamidah met Ilechukwu at a bus stop near
                    Clarke Quay at or around 10.47pm on 13 November 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> Hamidah said
                    that, at the bus stop, she observed that the Black Luggage was on the floor a
                    few meters behind Ilechukwu and that he “looked

                        scared and I was very suspicious of him. Furthermore, I also found it
                        suspicious that the bag was some distance away from [Ilechukwu] when we
                        first met. ... [Ilechukwu] looked like he wanted to get rid of the bag.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Despite that, Hamidah allowed Ilechukwu to put
                    the Black Luggage into the car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> This was notwithstanding her own
                    observation that Ilechukwu had behaved suspiciously at the bus stop and the fact
                    that Samuel had warned her about the possibility of drugs just moments before
                    her meeting with Ilechukwu.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     After Hamidah dropped Ilechukwu at the taxi
                    stand near Clarke Quay, she called Ilechukwu and then Samuel. Her evidence in
                    her statement clearly showed that she remained suspicious:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After I dropped [Ilechukwu] off, I called [Ilechukwu] again. I asked him
                        what’s wrong with him and why he looked so scared. He just said
                        nothing. I asked if he had reached his hotel. He said wait and told me that
                        he will call me back. I am now asked if I believed [Ilechukwu] when he had
                        said nothing in response to my question as to why he looked so scared. I
                        wish to say that I did not believe him. I am now asked why I had called
                        [Ilechukwu]. I had called him because I was still very suspicious of him and
                        feel that something is not right. After that, while I was travelling towards
                        Woodlands Checkpoint, I talked to [Samuel] on the phone. I told him that I
                        had already met [Ilechukwu] and picked up the luggage bag. I did not mention
                        that the person’s name was [Ilechukwu], I just said ‘the
                        person’. I told him that [Ilechukwu] looked very scared and that I was
                        very suspicious of him and the contents of the bag. [Samuel] told me that if
                        my heart doesn’t feel right, then I should U-turn and return the bag
                        to him. I am now asked why I did not make a U-turn and return the bag to
                        [Ilechukwu] since I was so highly suspicious. I wish to say that again I
                        thought of what my mother had told me, which is go straight and don’t
                        look back. I am now asked if I wanted to, could I have made a U-turn and
                        return the bag to [Ilechukwu]. I wish to say that I could have done that but
                        I did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This was corroborated by Ilechukwu, who
                    testified at the trial that Hamidah had called him after she dropped him off at
                    the taxi stand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> This was also
                    supported by Hamidah’s phone records which revealed that there were
                    several calls between Hamidah and Ilechukwu at around 11.33pm to
                        11.39pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu was seen entering the

                    Moreover, Hamidah’s phone records also confirmed that at least two calls
                    were made to Samuel at 11.42pm,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> after the
                    last call was made to Ilechukwu at 11.39pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Based on Hamidah’s evidence in her
                    statement, corroborated by Ilechukwu’s evidence and Hamidah’s phone
                    records, Hamidah was highly suspicious of the Black Luggage. At that point,
                    Hamidah was not just worried about the Nigerian passports. From her own
                    evidence, Hamidah was worried that it might have been drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Hamidah’s behaviour at time of arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After Hamidah dropped Ilechukwu at the taxi
                    stand in Clarke Quay, she drove towards the Woodlands Checkpoint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> At around 11.55pm, Hamidah
                    was stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint for a search.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Hamidah was asked by
                    the ICA officer if the Black Luggage belonged to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> She said that it belonged to
                    her friend by the name of “Rina”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> The Black Luggage was eventually cut
                    open at the sides and two packets of crystalline substance wrapped in brown
                    packaging were recovered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> Hamidah was asked if she knew what the
                    crystalline substance was, to which she simply answered that she did not
                        know.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> She did not express
                    any surprise that drugs were found in the Black Luggage. She did not say that
                    she was under the impression that the only contraband was Nigerian passports.
                    Hamidah’s response when the two packets of crystalline substance were
                    found was consistent with suspicion or knowledge on her part that she was
                    carrying drugs (see <em>Pang Siew Fum and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] 2 SLR 635 at [65]–[67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     To my mind, the most significant evidence
                    against Hamidah was her confession. This was recorded in her cautioned statement
                    dated 14 November 2011, shortly after she was arrested. The statement
                    that was recorded stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I don’t want to say anything but just to say that I am guilty. I am
                        begging not to receive the death penalty because of my children. Please try
                        and help me. I don’t know what else to say. The evidence is already
                        there. I’m only begging for a lighter sentence. I wouldn’t do
                        this anymore. I wouldn’t carry anybody’s bag anymore. I
                        don’t know what to say to the judge. I never go through this and face
                        the judge and go through court. I am begging for leniency due to my
                        age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Hamidah’s case was that the statement
                    was inaccurately recorded due to an error in the translation. She claimed that
                    she had said “<em>apa saya nak cakap, saya dah buat
                        salah</em>”, which should have been translated to “I
                    have done something wrong” and not “I am
                        guilty”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The interpreter gave evidence in court. She
                    testified that she could not recall the exact words that Hamidah had said to
                    her, but if Hamidah had in fact said the words claimed then she (the
                    interpreter) would have recorded them as “I have done something
                        wrong”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> The interpreter also stated that the
                    statement was read back to Hamidah and she did not want to make any
                        amendments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In my view, Hamidah’s claim did not make
                    sense in the context of the rest of the statement and the situation she was in.
                    She did not dispute that the remainder of the statement was recorded accurately.
                    What followed the first sentence were pleas for a lighter sentence. This was
                    consistent with the note of resignation in the disputed first sentence. Hamidah
                    was in a situation where she was facing a capital charge, a fact that she was
                    fully aware of from the words in her statement. She had testified that at that
                    time she was “scared and sad”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> and that she
                    loved and trusted Bengoodman. Yet, she did not appear to have been in shock and
                    disbelief at the betrayal and did not come out with what she claimed was the
                    truth, that she had thought that the only illegal items in the Black Luggage
                    were the two Nigerian passports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I should add that I also accepted the evidence
                    of the interpreter and found that the statement was accurately
                recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Checking the Black Luggage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There was some controversy in the trial over
                    whether Hamidah had checked the Black Luggage when she received it from
                    Ilechukwu. In my view, this issue was a red herring. Firstly, even if she had
                    conducted a check, detailed or otherwise, this did not mean that the presumption
                    of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA was rebutted. The fact that an
                    accused had performed a check but could not find any drugs in the bag would not,
                    in itself, suffice to prove on a balance of probability that the accused had no
                    knowledge of the drugs and thereby rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of
                    the MDA. At issue is whether an accused person has knowledge of the drugs found
                    in his possession and not whether he was negligent in failing to ensure that
                    there were no drugs. Indeed, someone who has no suspicion at all that the bag he
                    is given contains drugs would not be likely to make a check. And the fact that a
                    bag is checked could very well indicate that the person doing it believes that
                    there could be something sinister about its contents. In my view, the notion of
                    wilful blindness expounded in <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 has been misinterpreted in such a
                    manner that concepts from the law of negligence have been imported into this
                    area of criminal law. The issue is not whether any duty of care has been
                    satisfied by performing an adequate check of a bag. It is about whether the
                    accused had knowledge of the nature of the drugs found in his possession. In
                    this connection, the statements in [30]–[31] of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Nagaenthran</em> are apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    In <em>Tan Kiam Peng at
                                [141], this court held that s 18(2) of the MDA included
                                both actual knowledge in its “purest form”
                                (also referred to as “actual
                                knowledge simpliciter</em>” in <em>PP v Lim Boon Hiong </em>[2010] 4 SLR 696) as
                            well as <em>wilful blindness</em>. However,
                            one must be careful to avoid unnecessary refinement of
                                the <em>mens rea of knowledge. Wilful
                                blindness (or “</em>Nelsonian blindness”) is
                            merely “lawyer-speak” for <em>actual
                                knowledge</em> that is <em>inferred</em> from the circumstances of the case. It is
                            an indirect way to prove actual knowledge; <em>ie</em>, actual knowledge is proved because the inference of
                            knowledge is <em>irresistible</em> and is
                                the <em>only rational inference
                                available on the facts</em> (see <em>Pereira v Director of Public
                            Prosecutions</em> (1988) 63 ALJR 1 at 3). It is a subjective
                            concept, in that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of
                                the <em>accused</em> and not that
                            which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of
                            the accused (although this last-mentioned point may not be an irrelevant
                            consideration) (<em>ibid</em>). Wilful blindness is
                            not negligence or an inadvertent failure to make inquiries. It refers to
                            the blindness of a person to facts which, in the relevant context,
                                he <em>deliberately refuses to inquire into.
                                Such failure to inquire may sustain an inference of knowledge of the
                                actual or likely existence of the relevant drug. It must also be
                                emphasised that where the Prosecution seeks to rely on actual
                                knowledge in the form of wilful blindness, the alleged wilful
                                blindness must be proved beyond a reasonable
                            doubt</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    In so far as <em>rebutting</em> the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge
                            is concerned, we have stated earlier that the accused only needs to
                            prove that he had no knowledge of the <em>nature</em> of the controlled drug. Consistent with the
                            burden which he has to discharge, the accused has to adduce sufficient
                            evidence to demonstrate, on a <em>balance of
                                probabilities</em>, that he did not know the <em>nature</em> of that drug. This is a question of
                            fact in each case, and turns very much on the trial judge's assessment
                            of the credibility of the defence witnesses (especially that of the
                            accused, if he chooses to testify).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Accordingly, I found that Hamidah’s
                    confession, together with her reaction when the charge was read out to her, was
                    strong evidence that she knew that the Black Luggage contained drugs. This,
                    combined with the inconsistent evidence she had given in court, formed the basis
                    of my conclusion that Hamidah had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge
                    under s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for Ilechukwu’s acquittal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ilechukwu’s case was that he came to
                    Singapore for business,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> and had been asked to deliver the
                    Black Luggage on behalf of a friend to a business contact he was supposed to
                    meet in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> He had no reason to suspect that
                    the Black Luggage contained drugs given the various checks that were
                        done.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> In addition, it was not

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I accepted that Ilechukwu had rebutted the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ilechukwu’s evidence was
                        consistent with his position that he had come to Singapore as a trader and
                        had carried the Black Luggage as a favour for a friend, with no reason to
                        suspect that it contained drugs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ilechukwu’s defensive stance after he was arrested
                        and charged was not sufficient to show that he knew about the drugs in the
                        Black Luggage <em>before</em> the
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I will elaborate on my reasons
                        below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ilechukwu’s evidence consistent with his position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     According to Ilechukwu, he ran a business in
                    Nigeria selling second-hand electronic goods such as laptops.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> His purpose in Singapore was to buy
                    second-hand electronic goods for resale in Nigeria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>
                    In relation to these two points, Ilechukwu’s statement was generally
                    consistent with his evidence at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Ilechukwu gave evidence that he was budding
                    businessman in Nigeria,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> with a shop in Alaba
                        International.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> He wanted to come to Singapore to source
                    for cheap second-hand electronic goods for resale in Nigeria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> His
                    childhood friend, Izuchukwu had put him in touch with one Kingsley, who had
                    contacts in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu said that he
                    relied on Kingsley to provide him with the Singaporean contact upon
                    arrival.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">At Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Nigeria</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the day of Ilechukwu’s flight into
                    Singapore, he met Kingsley and Izuchukwu at the Murtala Muhammed International
                    Airport in Lagos, Nigeria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Kingsley passed
                    the Black Luggage to Ilechukwu with a request to pass it to the contact in
                    Singapore who was going to help Ilechukwu source for the second-hand electronic
                        goods.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Kingsley then called his contact
                    in Singapore to tell him that Ilechukwu was on his way.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu testified that this was the first
                    time he knew of this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> He was told that it contained clothes that
                    belonged to Kingsley’s contact in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu testified that he did not think
                    anything about it because Kingsley was Izuchukwu’s friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> While
                    Ilechukwu did not know Kingsley very well,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> he was aware
                    that Izuchukwu was “quite close” to Kingsley.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> To
                    him, it was just a small favour for Kingsley and his contact in
                        Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu opened the Black Luggage to
                    confirm that it contained clothes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> He explained that he checked even though
                    he did not think that there were drugs in the Black Luggage because it was
                    customary in Nigeria to check the contents of a bag that one was asked to
                        carry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu stated that the Black Luggage
                    also went through a physical check as well as an X-ray scan at the immigration
                    counter in the airport before it was checked-in for the flight to
                        Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Those checks had gone
                    through without incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Ilechukwu gave evidence that he had tried to
                    ask Kingsley for the details of the contact person but Kingsley had
                        refused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu said that he went along with
                    Kingsley’s arrangement because he felt that once he was able to meet up,
                    he would be able to conduct future transactions through that
                        contact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> While this may not be the most prudent
                    course of action to take, it was certainly not implausible given the context; a
                    young man with an ambition to succeed in business presented with an
                    opportunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I found that Ilechukwu’s testimony on
                    this point was corroborated by evidence. Firstly, he had entered Singapore with
                    the equivalent of US$5000; at the time of his arrest, he had US$4510, S$275.90
                    and 1,615 Nigerian Niara.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> This was consistent with his evidence
                    that he was here to source for second-hand electronic goods for resale in
                    Nigeria. Secondly, Kervinn Leng Seng Yau (“Kervinn”), the director
                    of ESP Lines (S) Pte Ltd, a freight forwarding company, gave evidence that many
                    Nigerians came to Singapore to buy electronic goods and ship them back to
                        Nigeria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> Kervinn also said that he had been informed
                    by his Lagos office that Ilechukwu was a trader coming to Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>
                    The prosecution had neither challenged nor offered an alternative explanation
                    for the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">At Changi Airport in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Ilechukwu received several SMS messages
                    shortly after he arrived in Singapore on 13 November 2011. These SMS
                    messages are set out below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     At the trial, Ilechukwu explained that it was
                    his first time travelling out of Nigeria.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> Izuchukwu, who
                    was working as a travel agent, told Ilechukwu that he had arranged the visa for
                    another Nigerian, and asked if he had seen him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> Izuchukwu then
                    gave Ilechukwu the number of the other Nigerian and asked Ilechukwu to call
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu’s evidence was that the
                    words “ESP [phone number redacted]” were written at the back of
                    his visa and he was told by Izuchukwu to ask the ICA officers to call the number
                    if he encountered delays or problems at Changi Airport.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> He also confirmed that the “ESP”
                    in the SMS messages referred to the freight forwarder that was mentioned earlier
                    ([48] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In my view, the SMS messages were not
                    indicative that Ilechukwu knew or must have suspected that the Black Luggage
                    contained drugs. While it was clear from what had happened that Kingsley and
                    possibly even Izuchukwu had knowledge of the illicit contents of the Black
                    Luggage, what was important was to test the evidence against Ilechukwu’s
                    evidence. This was his first time travelling out of Nigeria. It would not be
                    unusual for Izuchukwu, as a childhood friend and the person in charge of
                    Ilechukwu’s travel arrangements, to be concerned with whether Ilechukwu
                    was able to clear immigration in Singapore. There was only one SMS message that
                    referred to a “bag” (at 9.21am), and Ilechukwu’s evidence
                    was that it meant “go and carry your bag”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>
                    Ilechukwu said he did not know what “Delet” meant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> I
                    noted that the name of the other Nigerian who was on the same flight as
                    Ilechukwu ([50] above) was recorded in the transcript as “Adili”
                    or “Diley”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> and the
                    SMS message might have been meant for him instead. I also considered the
                    possibility that it was instructions for Ilechukwu to delete the SMS message
                    after reading it. However, the prosecution did not explore with Ilechuku what
                    “Delet” might possibly mean. As such, I did not think that it was
                    appropriate to draw any inferences based on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Despite the delay at the immigration,
                    Ilechukwu remained composed and went ahead to collect the Black Luggage instead
                    of quietly walking away. This was inconsistent with the behaviour of a person
                    who knew that the bag that he was asked to carry contained drugs. Such a person,
                    having been picked out by the authorities, would have seriously considered
                    walking away without the bag. However, Ilechukwu went to pick up the Black
                    Luggage and, more importantly, did not appear from the CCTV recording to be
                    flustered. He was certainly not flustered enough to be stopped by the ICA or
                    Central Narcotics Bureau officers when the Black Luggage was passed through the
                    X-ray machine and physically checked by an officer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Ilechukwu’s conduct at Changi Airport
                    was consistent with his position that he had no idea that there were illicit
                    drugs in the Black Luggage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">From Changi Airport to Hotel 81, Chinatown</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Ilechukwu left Changi Airport for Kim Tian
                    Hotel, where he was originally supposed to stay. However, when he got there, he
                    was asked to go to Hotel 81, Chinatown instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> When he inquired at the
                    check-in counter, he found that he did not have enough Singapore dollars to pay
                    for the room in Hotel 81. He went out to a moneychanger which was located across
                    the street.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> According to the CCTV footage,
                    Ilechukwu left the Black Luggage at the hotel lobby for about 12 minutes
                    (between 8.40pm and 8.52pm) before returning from the moneychanger with the
                    local currency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> This suggested that he
                    had no knowledge of the drugs in the Black Luggage. It would have been unusual
                    for a person with the knowledge that that he is carrying a bag containing drugs
                    for a drugs syndicate to leave the bag unattended in that manner as he would
                    expect severe consequences if he lost it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Ilechukwu paid for one night’s stay at
                    the hotel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> He explained that this was because
                    Kingsley’s contact was to show him where to get the second-hand electronic
                    goods the following day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> When the
                    prosecution pointed out to him that the call from Kingsley’s contact
                    (telling Ilechukwu, <em>inter alia</em>, that he will meet
                    him tomorrow) had come only <em>after</em> he checked in at
                    the hotel for one night, Ilechukwu maintained that his reason for staying only
                    for one night was that he did not know what the arrangement with
                    Kingsley’s contact was, but added that the hotel was too expensive and
                    Kingsley’s contact might relocate him to a cheaper one after the first
                        night.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> This might be prevarication on the part
                    of Ilechukwu. However, Ilechukwu’s consistent evidence had been that
                    Kingsley’s contact would meet him on the day after his arrival in
                    Singapore. This was why, according to Ilechukwu, he decided to only pay for one
                    night’s stay in Hotel 81, Chinatown. I noted that Ilechukwu had earlier
                    testified that Kingsley had called him when he was at Kim Tian
                        Hotel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Besides telling Ilechukwu to go to
                    Hotel 81, Chinatown, Kingsley had also told Ilechukwu that his contact would
                    meet Ilechukwu on the next day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> This was before
                    the call from Kingsley’s contact that the prosecution had pointed out to
                    Ilechukwu. In other words, Ilechukwu knew that he was meeting Kingsley’s
                    contact on the next day even before he reached Hotel 81,
                Chinatown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Ilechukwu’s conduct after he left Changi
                    Airport up to the check in at Hotel 81, Chinatown was consistent with his
                    position that that he did not know about the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Meeting with Hamidah</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Apart from arranging to meet on the next day,
                    Kingsley’s contact had also told Ilechukwu that “[his] woman will
                    come and take the bag” from Ilechukwu.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> This led to the
                    meeting between Ilechukwu and Hamidah on the night of
                    13 November 2011. Because Hamidah did not know the way to Hotel 81,
                    Chinatown, it was decided that Ilechukwu would take a taxi and meet Hamidah at
                    Clarke Quay instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Hamidah arrived at the designated place but
                    could not see Ilechukwu there.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> She called him
                    to ask for his location, and with the assistance of a Caucasian man who happened
                    to be nearby, Hamidah managed to find him at the bus stop in Clarke
                        Quay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     When Hamidah arrived at the bus stop in Clarke
                    Quay, she noticed that the Black Luggage was “near a dust bin or rubbish
                    bin”, at the rear of the bus stop, some distance away from
                        Ilechukwu.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> As mentioned earlier
                    ([30]–[31] above), Hamidah observed that Ilechukwu looked
                        worried.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> She explained that when
                    Ilechukwu went to retrieve the Black Luggage, he was looking to his right, and
                    she wondered if he was looking for or at someone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> However, she
                    did not try to ascertain who or what Ilechukwu was looking at.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span>
                    Given that this was his first time in a foreign country ([50] above) and left in
                    an unfamiliar place by the taxi that took him there, it would have been quite
                    normal for Ilechukwu to appear a little worried.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> Ilechukwu said that he had left the Black
                    Luggage at the rear of the bus stop in order to approach the Caucasian
                        man,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> and not because he wanted to put a
                    distance between himself and the Black Luggage, which was not in itself
                    unusual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     After Ilechukwu handed the Black Luggage to
                    Hamidah, they did not part immediately. Instead, it was the evidence of both
                    Hamidah and Ilechukwu that he got into the car with Hamidah.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> There was some inconsistency as to the
                    exact sequence of events, but both of them stated that Hamidah asked if
                    Ilechukwu had eaten and he replied in the negative. Hamidah offered to take him
                    to an African restaurant and Ilechukwu, who had not eaten since he landed
                    several hours earlier, accepted her offer. If Ilechukwu knew of the illicit
                    contents of the Black Luggage, it would be highly unusual for him to agree to
                    continue to be associated with it and prolong the risk of being caught, no
                    matter how hungry he was at that moment. The natural instinct of any person with
                    such knowledge would be to go off immediately. Ilechukwu’s conduct in this
                    regard was consistent with his position that he did not know about the
                    drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defensive stance after arrest </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     After his arrest, Ilechukwu had insisted in
                    all of his statements that he did not have anything to do with the Black Luggage
                    or Hamidah. This was subsequently proven to be untrue. The prosecution submitted
                    that these lies showed that he knew that the Black Luggage contained illicit
                    drugs, otherwise he would have come clean upon questioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In his first statement recorded shortly after
                    he was arrested, Ilechukwu said he brought only one luggage into
                        Singapore:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Ilechukwu explained that he did not lie in
                    this statement because he considered that the laptop bag (or in his words,

                    one laptop bag and one luggage (<em>ie</em>, Black
                    Luggage), it was not wrong for him to say that he had only brought one luggage
                    into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> The prosecution submitted that

                    Ilechukwu claimed that everything, including his laptop bag, had been taken out
                    of the hotel room and the officer did not point to any bag when the statement
                    was taken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was not disputed that SI Mohamed Affendi
                    Bin Ideris (“SI Affendi”), the officer who recorded the statement,
                    asked the question “[i]s that the luggage” and Ilechukwu answered
                    it in the positive. The only question was whether the laptop bag was in the
                    room, and whether SI Affendi pointed to it. SI Affendi testified that the laptop
                    bag was still in the room when the statement was taken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> I noticed that the evidence of ASP Edmund
                    Lim Changwei (“ASP Lim”) was that the items in Ilechukwu’s
                    room were seized before the statement was recorded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    At about 11.17 a.m., after Ilechukwu was handcuffed,
                            SI Affendi and Senior Staff Sergeant Mohammad Abdillah Bin Rahman
                            (“SSS Abdillah”) commenced a search of the hotel room in
                            his presence. <em>A number of items found in the room

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    ... At about 1.00 p.m., SI Affendi recorded a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>However, this did not contradict SI Affendi’s evidence
                        given that he had testified that the items seized were placed in

                        above), if SI Affendi had asked the question without pointing at the laptop

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Ilechukwu’s counsel, Mr Eugene
                    Thuraisingam, ran the alternative case that Ilechukwu had lied in the statement
                    because he was told that there was an arrest the previous night and two packets

                    some of them might have told the accused what he was being arrested
                        for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> To add to that, SI Affendi
                    confirmed that it was DSP Lek who gave him the instructions with regard to the
                    taking of the statement from Ilechukwu.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On the evidence before me, I could not rule
                    out the possibility that Ilechukwu had lied because he realised that there was
                    an arrest on the night before and a luggage with two packets of drugs were found
                    and/or that he was arrested for drug trafficking. The statement was taken
                    approximately two hours after the officers entered Ilechukwu’s hotel room
                    (from 11.00am to 1.00pm). At least one of the officers, namely DSP Lek, knew
                    that there was an arrest on the previous night that was in some way related to
                    Ilechukwu’s arrest. None of the officers could rule out the possibility
                    that someone might have told Ilechukwu about it, and there was no evidence on
                    the officers who were present at the hotel room between 11.00am and 1.00pm. Even
                    if none of the officers had mentioned it to Ilechukwu, it was possible that he
                    might have overheard the conversations between the officers and surmise that his
                    arrest must have something to do with the Black Luggage before the statement was
                    taken. In any event, it would not have been too difficult for Ilechukwu to
                    surmise, after being told that the arrest was related to a drug offence, that
                    the arrest could have something to do with the Black Luggage, as he had arrived
                    the previous night and had not done anything except pass the Black Luggage to
                    Hamidah. At the end of the day, I was not convinced based on the evidence before
                    me that Ilechukwu had lied in the statement about the number of luggage that he
                    had brought into Singapore because he knew <em>before he was
                        arrested</em> that the Black Luggage contained drugs. It was a
                    possible inference to draw in these circumstances but not the only one. In my
                    view, it was equally possible that Ilechukwu realised (whether he was told or
                    otherwise) that there was an arrest on the night before and a luggage with two
                    packets of drugs were found and/or that he was arrested for drug trafficking,
                    and decided that the best way forward was to lie about the Black
                Luggage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In his cautioned statement and long
                    statements, Ilechukwu maintained that he had nothing to do with the Black
                    Luggage or Hamidah.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> At
                    trial, Ilechukwu explained that he was not informed about the full facts
                    surrounding his arrest, and having heard that the offence carried the death
                    penalty, he decided that the safest course of action was to deny everything that
                    was not in his possession.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> It was clear from the
                    evidence that Ilechukwu was being defensive, and perhaps excessively so, but I
                    did not think that this showed unequivocally that Ilechukwu must have known
                    about the drugs in the Black Luggage <em>before</em> he was
                    arrested. This is especially so given that I have found that his conduct
                        <em>before</em> his arrest was not at all consistent
                    with a person with knowledge of the drugs. I also took into account the fact
                    that he had considered himself to be a victim of circumstances and viewed the
                    investigating officer, ASP Deng Kaile, with absolute suspicion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> This could have
                    contributed to Ilechukwu’s decision to deny everything relating to the
                    Black Luggage and Hamidah. In these circumstances, I was not confident that the
                    lies in the statements meant that Ilechukwu must have known about the drugs
                        <em>before</em> he was arrested. It was equally
                    possible that he came to realise that there were drugs in the Black Luggage
                        <em>after</em> he was arrested but <em>before</em> his statements were recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeo
                        Choon Poh</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 302, the accused was charged for
                    abetment in conspiring to traffic drugs. His defence was that he was an innocent
                    bailee of the drugs and did not know what was inside the two plastic bags that
                    were found in the boot of his car. Despite finding that the accused was not a
                    “good witness”, the trial judge held that the accused had
                    successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA
                    and acquitted him. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and convicted the
                    accused. According to the Court of Appeal, the lies of the accused were a
                    deliberate attempt on his part to dissociate himself from his conspirators as
                    well as to maintain ignorance of the drugs in his car, and rejected his
                    explanation for the lies as being incredible (at [34]). The essence of the
                    appeal, as the Court noted, was whether the trial judge was correct to decide
                    that the accused was a credible witness and therefore successfully rebutted the
                    presumption of knowledge (at [43]). In this regard, the Court disagreed with the
                    decision of the trial judge and stated that (at [44]–[45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    ... Unfortunately, we were of the view that the
                            reasons he gave for this conclusion were focused more on the fact that
                            the respondent was not in the presence of the other conspirators at all
                            times and was kept out of their discussions. Since we have held earlier
                            that presence throughout is not critical to a conspiracy, <em>the trial judge should have directed his mind to the other
                                evidence against the respondent, and decided whether despite all the
                                contradictions and lies, the respondent could still be
                                believed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J
                                in <em>Tara Singh</em> <em>v</em> <em>PP</em> [1949] MLJ 88 at 89, the principle is that an
                            impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by
                            a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. Thus
                            in the present case, <em>we were not satisfied from the
                                reasons given in his findings that the trial judge had in the
                                present case sufficiently considered all the evidence against the
                                respondent, especially the contradictions and lies told by the
                                respondent, when he came to a conclusion as to his veracity. In
                                fact, as we have already observed, the respondent's evidence at some
                                points was quite incredible</em>. We were firmly convinced
                            that he was not a credible witness and had not succeeded in rebutting
                            the presumption of knowledge, and the trial judge ought to have rejected
                            his innocent bailee defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Applying this approach in the present case, I
                    found Ilechukwu’s evidence at the trial to be generally credible and
                    supported by objective evidence: <em>eg</em>, on the
                    meeting with Hamidah ([57]–[60] above) and with regard to his purpose in
                    Singapore as a trader of second-hand electronic goods ([45] above). Viewing the
                    evidence in its totality, the lies in Ilechukwu’s statements as against
                    his conduct from the time of his arrival into Singapore up to his arrest, I
                    found on the balance of probabilities that it was more consistent with a person
                    with no knowledge of the drugs in the Black Luggage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On the evidence that I have before me, I found
                    that Ilechukwu had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of
                    the MDA. The drugs were so well hidden that he could not have known about it
                    unless he was told of it. His behaviour throughout, except at the time of
                    arrest, had been consistent with a person who had no inkling of the presence of
                    drugs in the Black Luggage. His explanation for his lies at the time of arrest
                    was not unreasonable given the situation he found himself, including the fact
                    that he was in a foreign land for the first time and unfamiliar with its laws
                    and customs. Indeed, the evidence before me was such that, if Ilechukwu actually
                    knew about the drugs or even the possibility that there were drugs in the Black
                    Luggage, they were not sufficient to lead me to that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the above reasons, I convicted Hamidah for
                    the offence of attempting to export not less than 1963.3g of methamphetamine
                    under s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA, and I acquitted Ilechukwu for the
                    offence of trafficking not less than 1963.3g of methamphetamine under
                        s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA.</p>
