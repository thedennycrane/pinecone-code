<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Although it is settled law that an adjudication
                    determination under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment
                    Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOPA”) may be set aside
                    where the adjudicator has exceeded his jurisdiction or acted in breach of
                    natural justice, the precise contours of the former appear to be in a state of
                    flux, whereas the latter has yet to receive significant attention. Nevertheless,
                    this state of affairs proved no barrier to the present application, where both
                    issues arise, and after hearing the submissions of counsel, I reserved judgment
                    to properly consider the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff and the defendant are both
                    contractors in the business of building and construction. By a letter of award
                    dated 12 April 2010, the plaintiff appointed the defendant to carry out
                    various development works at MacRitchie Reservoir Park (“the
                    site”). The defendant commenced works shortly after.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Disputes arose between the parties and by
                    December 2010, the defendant had largely ceased work on the site. Nevertheless,
                    it was not disputed that rectification works continued after that. On
                    31 March 2011, the defendant served a document titled “Progress
                    Claim No. 8” on the plaintiff for the sum of $672,569.97. When this
                    sum was not paid, the defendant filed an adjudication application, SOP/AA059, on
                    19 April 2011. An adjudicator (“the Adjudicator”) was
                    appointed on 27 April 2011. The plaintiff served its adjudication response
                    on 29 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After considering the submissions of the
                    parties, the Adjudicator called for an adjudication conference (“the
                    Adjudication Conference”) on 4 May 2011. The parties were then given
                    an opportunity to make final submissions. On 26 May 2011, the Adjudicator
                    issued an adjudication determination (“the Adjudication
                    Determination”), finding in favour of the defendant and ordering the
                    plaintiff to pay the defendant the claimed sum of $672,569.97 plus interest and
                    costs. The defendant obtained leave to enforce the Adjudication Determination on
                    28 June 2011 by way of Originating Summons No 486 of 2011. Dissatisfied,
                    the plaintiff took out the present application on 25 July 2011to set aside
                    the Adjudication Determination on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Progress Claim No. 8 was not a
                        valid payment claim under the SOPA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     even if Progress Claim No. 8 was a valid payment
                        claim under the SOPA, it was served out of time and time-barred;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Adjudicator
                        breached the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is worth noting that in the course of the
                    adjudication, the plaintiff had raised the issue of the timeliness of the
                    service of Progress Claim No. 8 only at the stage of making final
                    submissions, after the Adjudication Conference had taken place. The issue of
                    service was not one of the original issues agreed upon by the parties at the
                    Adjudication Conference. As for the issue of the validity of Progress Claim
                    No. 8 as a payment claim under the SOPA, this was never raised as an issue
                    at any stage of the adjudication. Rather, the plaintiff had, throughout the
                    adjudication process, sought to establish that it had, by way of a letter dated
                    12 April 2011, served on the defendant a valid payment response under the
                    SOPA to Progress Claim No. 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The main issues that arose in the present
                    application are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether Progress Claim No. 8
                        constituted a valid payment claim (“the validity
                        issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, whether Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time (“the
                        service issue”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any event, whether there were breaches of natural
                        justice that warranted the setting aside of the Adjudication
                        Determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant also raised a preliminary issue of
                    whether the plaintiff was estopped from raising the validity issue and the
                    service issue because they had not been brought up during the Adjudication
                    Conference. I will deal with the preliminary issue before considering the other
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The preliminary issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In my judgment, the plaintiff was not estopped
                    from raising the validity issue and the service issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dealing with the service issue first, I observe
                    that the service issue <em>was</em> considered by the
                    Adjudicator in the Adjudication Determination as it had been raised by the
                    plaintiff in its final submissions. I saw no reason to limit the scope of what
                    was permissible for the plaintiff to argue in the present application to the
                    issues agreed on at the Adjudication Conference where the Adjudicator had not so
                    limited himself in the Adjudication Determination; the defendant provided no
                    authorities to persuade me otherwise. There was therefore no basis for the
                    defendant to object to the consideration of the service issue in the present
                    application on the ground of estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This, however, could not be said of the
                    validity issue, which did not arise in any form throughout the entire
                    adjudication process. Nevertheless, the plaintiff argued that the fact that the
                    validity issue did not arise in the adjudication process was no bar to it being
                    raised before a court, because the validity issue went to the jurisdiction of
                    the adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff relied on <em>Chip Hup </em><em>Hup Kee v Ssangyong Engineering
                        &amp; Construction</em> [2010] 1 SLR 658 (“<em>Chip Hup</em>”) at [44], where Judith Prakash J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...if the tribunal concerned does not have [jurisdiction in the strict
                        sense of capacity to hear], <em>any party to the dispute may
                            assert the lack of jurisdiction at any stage and can never be held to be
                            estopped from doing so or to have waived its right of
                        protest</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff recognised that Prakash J concluded (at [59] of
                        <em>Chip Hup</em>) that the adjudicator possessed
                    jurisdiction to hear and determine the adjudication application filed by the
                    claimant <em>as soon as he accepted the appointment made by the
                        Singapore Mediation Centre</em>, but submitted that in the light of
                    subsequent decisions of the High Court, the validity issue should be taken to be
                    a jurisdictional one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before exploring this matter further, I note
                    at this juncture that the service issue appears to have been recognised as a
                    jurisdictional issue the determination of which may lead to the setting aside of
                    an adjudication determination (see Prakash J’s decision in <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 733 (“<em>SEF
                    Construction</em>”) at [45(b)]; Lee Seiu Kin J’s decision in
                        <em>Sungdo Engineering &amp; Construction (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Italcor Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 459 (<em>“Sungdo</em>”) at [32]; and Tay Yong Kwang J’s decision in <em>Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction
                        Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili Terence)</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 109 (“<em>Chua Say
                    Eng</em>”) at [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The validity issue presents more difficulty as
                    the judgments of the High Court do not speak with one voice on the matter. To
                    provide a brief overview of these positions, I can do no better than quote Tay
                    J’s summary of the law in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> at
                        [13]–[21], describing the developments after
                        <em>Chip Hup</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13     About two
                            months after her decision in <em>Chip Hup</em>,
                            Prakash J set out her views in [<em>SEF
                                Construction</em>] on the court’s role when asked to set
                            aside an adjudication determination or a judgment arising from the same.
                            She said at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">42     Accordingly, instead of reviewing the
                            merits (in any direct or indirect fashion), <em>it is my
                                view that the court's role must be limited to supervising the
                                appointment and conduct of the adjudicator to ensure that the
                                statutory provisions governing such appointment and conduct are
                                adhered to and that the process of the adjudication, rather than the
                                substance, is proper</em>. After all, in any case, even if the
                            adjudicator does make an error of fact or law in arriving at his
                            adjudication determination, such error can be rectified or compensated
                            for in subsequent arbitration or court proceedings initiated in
                            accordance with the contract between the claimant and the respondent and
                            intended to resolve all contractual disputes that have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14     To further elucidate the
                        limits of the court’s role, Prakash J had regard to the New South
                        Wales Court of Appeal (“NSW CA”) case of <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport</em> [2004] NSWCA 394
                            (“<em>Brodyn</em>”). In <em>Brodyn</em>, Hodgson JA first stated (at [51]) that the
                        scheme of the equivalent New South Wales Act (“the NSW Act”)
                        “appears strongly against the availability of judicial review on the
                        basis of non-jurisdictional error of law.” The judge went on (at
                        [53]) to consider what the conditions for the existence of an
                        adjudicator’s determination were:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The basic and essential requirements appear to include the
                            following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">1. The existence of a construction contract between the claimant and
                            the respondent, to which the Act applies (ss 7 and 8).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>2</em>. <em>The service by the
                                claimant on the respondent of a payment claim
                            (s 13)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">3. The making of an adjudication application by the claimant to an
                            authorised nominating authority (s 17).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">4. The reference of the application to an eligible adjudicator, who
                            accepts the application (ss 18 and 19).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">5. The determination by the adjudicator of this application
                            (ss 19(2) and 21(5)), by determining the amount of the progress
                            payment, the date on which it becomes or became due and the rate of
                            interest payable (ss 22(1)) and the issue of a determination in
                            writing (ss 22(3)(a))."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for more detailed statutory requirements of the NSW Act such as
                        “section 13(2) as to the content of payment claims; section 17
                        as to the time when an adjudication application can be made and as to its
                        contents”, Hodgson JA disapproved of the approach which asked
                        “whether an error by the adjudicator in determining whether any of
                        these requirements is satisfied is a jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional
                        error” as he thought that approach “tended to cast the net too
                        widely”. He preferred to ask “whether a requirement being
                        considered was intended by the legislature to be an essential pre-condition
                        for the existence of an adjudicator's determination.” (see <em>Brodyn</em> at [54])</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15     At [44] and [45] of
                            <em>SEF Construction</em>, Prakash J adopted
                        Hodgson JA’s discussion on the basic and essential requirements
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    Although sub-paragraph (b) of [45] in <em>SEF Construction</em> … included the service
                            by the claimant on the respondent of a payment claim, Prakash J
                            made clear at [46] of <em>SEF Construction</em>
                            that whether a purported payment claim was actually a payment claim
                            under the SOPA was an issue for the adjudicator ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17     Prakash J next decided
                        the case of <em>AM Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna
                            National Golf and Country Club Ltd</em> [2009] SGHC 260
                            (“<em>AM Associates</em>”), in which
                        she applied her holdings in <em>SEF Construction</em>.
                        The respondent in the adjudication proceedings there applied to set aside
                        the adjudication determination on the basis that the payment claim it was
                        served with (“Payment Claim 1”) was not a valid payment claim
                        under the SOPA. Prakash J held (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... It was not my place to determine whether Payment Claim 1 was
                            a valid payment claim or not. This was an enquiry that fell squarely
                            within the jurisdiction of the Adjudicator and it is one that he
                            recognised and dealt with. <em>What the court would be
                                concerned with is whether prior to making an adjudication
                                application the claimant had served a purported payment
                                claim</em>. In this case, Payment Claim 1 had been served
                            by AMA and <em>whether it was actually a “payment
                                claim” within the meaning of that term under the SOP Act, was
                                a mixed question of law and fact for the Adjudicator</em>, who
                            would be privy to the facts, <em>to
                            decide</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Sungdo Engineering</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18     Shortly after the <em>AM
                            Associates</em> decision, Lee Seiu Kin J
                        (“Lee J”) decided the case of [<em>Sungdo</em>]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20     Significantly, Lee J
                        disagreed with Prakash J’s statements at [56] of [C<em>hip Hup</em>] …, stating (at [32]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not
                            vested until his appointment by an ANB (“authorised nominating
                            body”), <em>I am, with respect, unable to agree
                                that jurisdiction is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim or
                                service thereof</em>. The power of the ANB to appoint an
                            adjudicator arises from the receipt of an adjudication application from
                            a claimant, and that is predicated by a whole chain of events initiated
                            by the service of a Payment Claim by the claimant on the respondent
                            under s 10 of the Act. It must follow that if the claimant had
                            failed to serve a Payment Claim, or to serve something that constitutes
                            a Payment Claim, the power to appoint an adjudicator for that particular
                            claim has not arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for Prakash J’s view at [46] of <em>SEF
                            Construction</em> (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                        above) that whether or not a purported payment claim is actually a payment
                        claim under the SOPA is an issue for the adjudicator and not the court,
                        Lee J went on to say at [34]
                        that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... In principle, if the validity of a Payment Claim goes to
                            jurisdiction, I do not see how a court is precluded from examining this
                            issue on judicial review and I would, with respect, disagree with
                            this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21     Lee J then distinguished <em>SEF Construction</em> on the basis that in any event, the
                        2008 Letter did not <em>purport</em> to be a payment
                        claim under the SOPA as nothing therein stated that it was so. Finally,
                        notwithstanding Lee J’s disagreement in principle with Prakash J,
                        he stated that in practice, where a document did purport to be a payment
                        claim under the SOPA, the court should only review an adjudicator’s
                        decision that it was indeed a valid payment claim under the SOPA on the
                        basis of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness (see
                            <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v
                            Wednesbury Corporation</em> [1948]
                        1 KB 223)…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In short, although Prakash J has, <em>inter alia</em>, in <em>SEF
                        Construction</em> taken the position that the validity issue is an
                    issue for the adjudicator and not for the court, implying that it is not a
                    matter for the court’s consideration in a setting aside application, Lee J
                    had respectfully disagreed in <em>Sungdo</em>, concluding
                    that the court may review an adjudicator’s decision on the validity issue
                    and that where a document purports to be a payment claim under the SOPA, the
                    court may conduct its review on the basis of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Tay J in <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em> (at [28]) agreed with
                    the position taken by Lee J, having regard to the New South Wales Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Chase Oyster Bar v Hamo
                        Industries</em> [2010] NSWCA 190. That case was decided after
                        <em>SEF Construction</em>, and had departed from the
                    position in <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport</em> [2004]
                    NSWCA (which was followed in <em>SEF Construction</em>) to
                    favour a less restrictive approach towards the question of what constitutes a
                    jurisdictional issue in the context of an application to set aside an
                    adjudication determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It appears then, at present, that the weight
                    of authority reflects an approach where the failures to comply with the
                    specifications of time and other requirements laid down in the SOPA become open
                    to the court’s scrutiny on the basis that the parties’ rights to
                    avail themselves of the unique mechanism provided by the SOPA depended on strict
                    compliance with it. However, where an adjudicator had previously considered such
                    jurisdictional issues, then consistent with the aim of the SOPA to
                    “[maintain] cash flow in the [construction] industry” by providing
                    “a fast track procedure for an interim decision in respect of a disputed
                    payment claim” (<em>per</em> Prakash J in <em>Chip Hup</em> at [57]), an adjudicator’s determination
                    ought not to be reviewed too extensively. In <em>Sungdo</em> and <em>Chua Say Eng</em>, the
                    threshold for review has been pegged at the standard of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness. In particular, with respect to the
                    validity issue, the key question for the court to determine would be whether a
                    purported payment claim had been made according to the rules established in
                        <em>Sungdo</em> and <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em>. Although in the present case the validity issue had not
                    arisen for consideration by the Adjudicator, it was not disputed by the
                    plaintiff and defendant that the reasoning in <em>Sungdo</em> and <em>Chua Say Eng</em> remained
                    relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I therefore proceed to consider the substance
                    of the plaintiff’s claims in respect of both the service issue and the
                    validity issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Progress Claim No. 8 constituted a valid payment
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff argued that Progress Claim
                    No. 8 was not a valid payment claim for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was not intended by the defendant
                        as a payment claim under the SOPA, and even if it did, such intention was
                        not communicated to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was made in breach of reg 5(1) of the Building and
                        Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations 2005 (Cap 30B,
                        Reg 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOP Regulations”) as two
                        payment claims had been served in the month of March 2011;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     it was made in
                        breach of s 10(1) of the SOPA as the defendant had served more than one
                        payment claim for a progress payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was intended as a payment claim
                under the SOPA and if so, whether such intention was communicated</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff’s first argument was a
                    factual one. According to the plaintiff, its usual course of dealings with the
                    defendant was such that a payment claim would only be made by the defendant
                    after the plaintiff had issued an interim certification of the value of the
                    works done by the defendant. The defendant’s unilateral issuance of
                    Progress Claim No. 8 was not in line with this usual practice.
                    Additionally, the plaintiff also argued that after the works had ceased in
                    December 2010, the defendant began haphazardly submitting various progress
                    claims, sometimes two times in the same month and differing in format and style.
                    In this context, it could not be said that the intention to make a payment claim
                    via Progress Claim No. 8 had been communicated to the plaintiff. Further,
                    the cover letter enclosing Progress Claim No. 8 stated that it was
                    submitted “for work done ending up to 25<sup>th</sup>
                    March 2011 for your kind certification”. The plaintiff also relied on an
                    alleged admission in an affidavit made on behalf of the defendant where a
                    director of the defendant had stated that “Progress Claim No. 8 was
                        <em>simply a progress claim asking for
                    payment</em>” [emphasis added] to argue that it was not intended as
                    a payment claim under the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel for the defendant emphasised that the
                    plaintiff had not challenged the validity of Progress Claim No. 8 as a
                    payment claim under the SOPA until the present application, despite being
                    represented by counsel throughout. It also relied on <em>Sungdo</em> (at [17]) for the
                    proposition that “there is no requirement for a payment claim to
                    expressly state that it is made under the SOPA for it to be a valid payment
                    claim under [the SOPA]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I was not persuaded by the plaintiff’s
                    arguments and set out the material parts of the cover letter to Progress Claim
                    No. 8 for ease of reference:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     First, it was apparent that Progress Claim
                    No. 8, was “a business-like document” and from its contents,
                    it was apparent that it was claiming that a sum of money was due (see <em>Chua Say Eng</em> at [31]). Although a sentence in the cover letter had referred to
                    work done for the plaintiff’s “certification”, it must have
                    been evident to the plaintiff that payment was sought from the rest of the
                    document, for example, in the penultimate sentence “[w]e trust that the
                    aforesaid claim is in order and look forward to your prompt payment”. The
                    reference to “certification” was also consistent with the dealings
                    between the parties described by the plaintiff where the whole purpose of
                    certification by the plaintiff was so that the defendant could obtain payment
                    for work done. The plaintiff’s argument taken to its logical conclusion
                    would mean that due to the earlier course of dealings between the parties, the
                    defendant would be barred from making any claims for payment unless the
                    plaintiff had on its own initiative certified payments as being due. This was
                    not commercially sensible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Second, as established in <em>Sungdo</em> (at [17]), it was
                    not necessary for the payment claim to state expressly that it was made under
                    the SOPA, although this would have been the clearest way to communicate such an
                    intention. The only formal requirements for validity under the SOPA are found in
                    s 10(3) and reg 5(2) of the SOP Regulations that provide for every payment
                    claim to be in writing, to identify the relevant contract and contain details of
                    the claimed amount (see <em>Chua Say Eng</em> at [38]). It is not disputed that any of these
                    formal requirements have not been met in respect of Progress Claim
                    No. 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Third, an important factor was that the
                    plaintiff had by seeking to prove that it had made a valid payment response in
                    the course of the adjudication whilst not taking any issue with the validity of
                    the payment claim, apparently understood at the material time that Progress
                    Claim No. 8 was intended as a payment claim under the SOPA. In this
                    context, counsel for the plaintiff’s argument that the plaintiff had been
                    “ambushed” by Progress Claim No. 8, which was
                    “disguised” as a valid payment claim, rang hollow. It was apparent
                    from the plaintiff’s arguments in the adjudication that it had treated
                    Progress Claim No. 8 as a payment claim under the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Fourth, although it was true that previous
                    progress claims had been made where non-payment was not followed with an
                    adjudication application, including: (a) a $464,412.20 “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Progress Claim for Work Done Up to:</font>
                    31/Dec/2010” on 17 January 2011; (b) a $502,755.53 “Progress
                    Claim For Work Done Up To: 25/Dec/2010” on a subsequent unstated date;
                    and (c) a $395,755.53 tax invoice “Being 7<sup>th</sup>
                    Progress Claim” on 10 March 2011, this was but one factor and
                    considering all the circumstances of the case, would not lead me to conclude
                    that Progress Claim No. 8 was not intended as a payment claim under the
                    SOPA. Further, these earlier claim documents were of a different nature from
                    Progress Claim No. 8, which was accompanied by a formal cover letter, with
                    provision for the plaintiff to sign as “Acknowledgement of Receipt of the
                    Claim”. I also did not think that the statement in the affidavit made on
                    behalf of the defendant, read in context, could be treated as an admission that
                    the defendant did not intend Progress Claim No. 8 to be a payment claim
                    under the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Sungdo</em>, Lee J
                    came to the conclusion that the payment claim in question was not a valid
                    payment claim under the SOPA for five reasons: (a) the defendant did not
                    communicate its intention to the plaintiff that it was a payment claim under the
                    SOPA (there was no mention in the covering letter of a claim being made under
                    the SOPA or any other communication that would alert the plaintiff of the nature
                    of the document); (b) <em>the plaintiff did not treat it as a
                        payment claim</em> (no payment response was provided); (c) events
                    prior to the service of the letter suggested that it was not a payment claim
                    (there were previous instances where invoices had been submitted but no
                    adjudication application followed, <em>a writ was filed in court
                        and parties had filed pleadings before the alleged payment claim was
                        sent</em>); (d) the contents of the covering letter did not suggest it
                    was a payment claim due <em>inter alia</em>, to its
                        <em>informality</em> (the alleged payment claim was
                    titled “Letter from Italcor to Sungdo”, contained a festive
                    greeting, the person signing the letter was not identified, and the date was
                    handwritten); and (e) it was <em>against public policy</em>
                    to leave scope for potential claimants to ambush respondents by making multiple
                    submissions of documents and applying for adjudication the minute the respondent
                    failed to provide a payment response <em>even after litigation
                        had been commenced</em>. I have set out these reasons in some detail
                    to illustrate the unusual circumstances present in <em>Sungdo</em>. Based on the facts I have enumerated above (at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>), the present case was evidently quite different from
                        <em>Sungdo</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of reg 5(1) of
                the SOP Regulations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is not disputed that reg 5(1) of the SOP
                    Regulations applied in the present case and provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5.</b>—(1)  Where a contract
                        does not contain any provision specifying the time at which a payment claim
                        shall be served or by which such time may be determined, then a payment
                        claim made under the contract shall be served by the last day of each month
                        following the month in which the contract is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff argued that relying on Tay
                    J’s analysis in <em>Chua Say Eng</em> and on a
                    literal interpretation of reg 5(1), only one payment claim may be served each
                    month by the last day of each month. It argued that the document titled
                    “TAX INVOICE” dated 10 March 2011 and described as
                    “Being 7<sup>th</sup> Progress Claim” and
                    containing a breakdown of the “Total Work Done As At 25/12/2010”
                    (“the 10 March 2011 document”) (referred to at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) was a purported payment claim and
                    there were therefore two purported payment claims in March 2011. This was not
                    permissible under reg 5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Without going into the correctness of the
                    plaintiff’s interpretation of the law, this argument hinged on the
                    10 March 2011 document being a payment claim or at least a purported
                    payment claim under the SOPA. I find that this could not be the case as the
                    10 March 2011 failed to comply with reg 5(2)(<em>c</em>) of the SOP Regulations, which required a payment claim to
                    contain details of the claimed amount, including:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i) a breakdown of the items constituting the claimed amount;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii) a description of these items;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii) the quantity or quantum of each item; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv) the calculations which show how the claimed amount is derived</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The only calculation contained in the
                    10 March 2011 document was:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">There was no breakdown of the work done or a particularisation of the
                    description, quantity, quantum or the unit price of each item of work. Unlike
                    Progress Claim No. 8, such a detailed breakdown was also not attached. The
                    10 March 2011 could not therefore be a payment claim under the
                SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I would also add that apart from failing to
                    meet the formal requirements for validity under the SOP Regulations, it was
                    clear to me that the 10 March 2011 document could not have been a <em>purported</em> payment claim under the SOPA, <em>ie</em>, it could not have been intended as a payment claim
                    under the SOPA (see <em>Sungdo</em> at [20]). It took the form of an unremarkable tax
                    invoice and it was marked “Attn: Account Department”, without any
                    specific person’s attention being drawn to it. It was signed by an
                    “Authorized Signature” who was not identified and contained the
                    handwritten words “Total Amount including GST”, reflecting a
                    certain degree of informality. There was additionally no attempt made whatsoever
                    to describe and quantify the work done as evident from the lack of content in
                    the columns “Quantity” and “Unit Price”. These facts
                    did not suggest any sort of intention for the 10 March 2011 to be treated
                    as a payment claim under the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I therefore find that Progress Claim
                    No. 8 was not in breach of reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was made in breach of s 10(1)
                of the SOPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 10(1) of the SOPA provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>10.</b>—(1)  A
                        claimant may serve one payment claim in respect of a progress payment
                        on —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) one or more other persons who, under
                            the contract concerned, is or may be liable to make the payment;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) such other person as specified in or
                            identified in accordance with the terms of the contract for this
                            purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     “Progress payment” is in turn
                    defined by 2 of the SOPA to mean:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying
                        out of construction work, or the supply of goods or services, under a
                        contract, and includes —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) a single or one-off payment;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) a payment that is based on an event
                            or a date;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff argued that because works had
                    ceased at the site by December 2010 with only rectification works carrying on
                    thereafter, Progress Claim No. 8 although expressed as being for work done
                    “up to 25<sup>th</sup> March 2011”, was actually
                    for work done up to 31 December 2010. As the Defendant had previously
                    submitted other progress claims for work in that period, (see above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) a further claim for progress payment for
                    works done up to December 2010 could not be made because this would be in breach
                    of s 10(1) of the SOPA, which only allowed “<em>one</em> payment claim in respect of <em>a</em>
                    progress payment” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This argument hinged on the proposition that
                    rectification works were not works in respect of which a progress claim could be
                    made. When questioned, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that rectification
                    works were not “construction work, or the supply of goods or
                    services” under s 2 of the SOPA that would entitle the defendant to
                    a progress payment because rectification works would be paid for out of the
                    retention monies held back by the plaintiff. However, there was no provision in
                    the contract between the parties to that effect, neither was there any other
                    evidence on the practices of the construction industry that could establish such
                    a proposition. In any event, I observe that excluding rectification works from
                    the concept of “construction work, or the supply of goods or
                    services” which would entitle a claimant to a progress payment, would be
                    contrary to s 3 of the SOPA, which defined “construction
                    work”, “goods” and “services” in a manner
                    that could not on a reasonable interpretation be read as excluding rectification
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I therefore rejected the plaintiff’s
                    argument that Progress Claim No. 8 was in breach of s 10(1) of the
                    SOPA and consequently decided against the plaintiff in respect of the validity
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The second challenge brought by the plaintiff
                    to set aside the Adjudication Determination was the service issue. The plaintiff
                    argued that because all the works under the contract it had with the defendant
                    had ceased by December 2010 and only rectification works were carried out after
                    December 2010, in accordance with the interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA
                    and reg 5(1) of the SOP Regulations given by Tay J in <em>Chua
                        Say Eng</em>, Progress Claim No. 8 was served out of time as it
                    should have been served by 31 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant argued that the Adjudicator had
                    ample opportunity to consider the service issue and came to the conclusion that
                    because the contract continued between the plaintiff and the defendant at the
                    material time, with the defendant continuing to carry out rectification works as
                    well as payment negotiations with the plaintiff well into February 2011,
                    Progress Claim No. 8 was served on time (by 31 March 2011), regardless
                    of which interpretation of s 10(2) of the SOPA and reg 5(1) of the SOP
                    Regulations was adopted. There was therefore no reason to challenge the
                    Adjudicator’s decision as being unreasonable on a <em>Wednesbury</em> basis. The defendant also sought to distinguish
                        <em>Chua Say Eng</em> on the basis that this was a case
                    where the defendant was entitled to claim not only the additional sums due for
                    further works that were completed in March 2011, but also for all monies
                    previously unpaid at that point under s 10(4) of the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Suffice it to say, and for the reasons stated
                    in <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above, I saw no reason to disagree
                    with the Adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there were breaches of natural justice that warranted the
                setting aside of the Adjudication Determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Under s 16(3)(<em>c</em>) of the SOPA, an adjudicator is obliged to “comply with
                    the principles of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The breach of natural justice complained of by
                    the plaintiff was essentially that the Adjudicator had, in the Adjudication
                    Determination, referred to other unpublished adjudication determinations known
                    to the Adjudicator and that were not cited by the parties. The plaintiff
                    complained that by failing to allow it an opportunity to address the Adjudicator
                    on these other adjudication determinations, the Adjudicator had acted in breach
                    of the natural justice principle <em>audi </em><em>alteram </em><em>partem</em>. Citing
                        <em>SEF Construction</em>, <em>Soh Beng
                        Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR 86 (“<em>Soh Beng Tee</em>”),
                    the New Zealand High Court decision in <em>Trustees of Rotoaira
                        Forest Trust v Attorney-General</em> [1999] 2 NZLR 452
                        (“<em>Rotoaira</em>”) and the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Fox v PG Wellfair Ltd</em>
                    [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 514, the plaintiff argued that as long as the
                    adjudicator had incorporated his own opinions and ideas into the Adjudication
                    Determination, which were not reasonably foreseeable to the parties, and to the
                    extent that this had created surprise and deprived them of the right to address
                    full arguments on those opinions and ideas, the Adjudication Determination ought
                    to be set aside as being in breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The defendant, on the other hand, argued that
                    the plaintiff’s contention could not stand as both parties had ample
                    opportunity to present their cases to the Adjudicator. In any event, the
                    defendant also submitted that no prejudice was caused to the plaintiff as it was
                    clear from the Adjudication Determination that the references to the previous
                    adjudication determinations did not materially affect the Adjudicator’s
                    conclusions. The defendant relied on the summary of principles in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65], which was a case decided in
                    relation to an arbitration award, particularly for the statement that “an
                    award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules
                    of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately
                    remedied”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It is first important to recognise that what
                    is required by natural justice depends heavily on the context in which it
                    operates. Prakash J in <em>SEF Construction</em> at [52]
                    endorsed the views expressed by Assistant Registrar Lim Jian Yi in <em>Chip Hup </em><em>Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd
                        v Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd</em>
                    [2008] SGHC 159 at [50] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Justice, whether performed by a court, a tribunal or any quasi-judicial
                        body, is a balancing exercise between thoroughness and timeliness. More
                        formal settings, such as litigation through a court, would tend to emphasis
                        the former. The adjudication process under the [SOPA] instead chooses a
                        quicker, but somewhat less thorough, means of achieving justice. This is a
                        general theme which pervades the [SOPA] and in itself is not a ground for
                        saying that natural justice has been denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Court of Appeal in <em>Soh
                        Beng Tee</em> also recognised at [65(b)] that fairness was “a
                    multidimensional concept and it would be unfair to the successful party if it
                    were deprived of the fruits of its labour as a result of a dissatisfied party
                    raising a multitude of arid technical challenges”. The “overriding
                    burden [was] on the applicant to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes
                    could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the
                    award” (<em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65(d)]). This was
                    a question of fact and degree to be determined in the individual case (<em>Rotoaira</em> at 162). Although said in the context of
                    examining an arbitration award, these principles are equally applicable
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the present case, it was not disputed that
                    the Adjudicator had in the Adjudication Determination made various references to
                    other adjudication determinations that the parties had not cited to him. To that
                    extent, he had caused surprise. However, this should not in itself lead to the
                    setting aside of the Adjudication Determination, particularly where these
                    unpublished adjudication determinations, when read in context, served merely as
                    examples and illustrations and could not have affected the outcome of the case.
                    In respect of the reference to AA SOP No 62 of 2011, which the oral and written
                    submission of the plaintiff focussed on, the Adjudicator had clearly indicated
                    that he would not be relying on the interpretation of the SOPA and the SOP
                    Regulations contained in that case but regarded <em>Chua Say
                        Eng</em> as authoritative. He had also stated that whether he followed
                    the interpretation in AA SOP No 62 of 2011 or that in <em>Chua
                        Say Eng</em>, the same result would follow as his decision on the
                    service issue rested on a factual determination that the contract between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant continued into February 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was true that the parties were not invited
                    to address the specific adjudication determinations cited by the Adjudicator,
                    but it could not be denied that they had ample opportunity to address the
                        <em>issues</em> in question whether at the Adjudication
                    Conference or through the various rounds of submissions submitted to the
                    Adjudicator. It cannot be said that a reasonable litigant in the shoes of the
                    plaintiff could not have foreseen the possibility of <em>reasoning of the type revealed in the award</em> merely because the
                    particular examples and references provided by the Adjudicator were not
                    previously known to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In my judgment, the Adjudicator had complied
                    with the <em>audi </em><em>alteram
                        </em><em>partem</em> principle. The Adjudicator
                    had made known his concerns on the (contentious) service issue, and had invited
                    parties to address him on <em>Chua Say Eng</em> and the
                    first instance decision of <em>Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as
                        Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick Terence @ Li Weili
                        Terence</em> [2010] SGHC 333, and they had done so. Although
                    his decision on the service issue did not accept either the plaintiff’s or
                    the defendant’s submission in their entirety, he was not required or
                    obliged to do so (see <em>Rotoaira</em> at 463; <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65(e)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
