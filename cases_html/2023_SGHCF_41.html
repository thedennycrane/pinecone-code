The problem for the Husband is that he has no documentary or direct evidence to support the existence of any alleged [B] Agreement, or to prove that the transfer of the [D] shares to the Wife by her father was carried out pursuant to it. The Husband claims that this was a “verbal agreement”.

</div> In support of his contention that the [D] shares were held by the Wife on his behalf, he pointed to the fact that her father gave her [D] shares but gave none to her siblings. He argued that her father would distribute his assets allegedly according to a fixed formula, an inference drawn from the fact that he gave each of his sons a 20% shareholding in [C] Malaysia, and 5% to each of his daughters including the Wife.

The Husband applied the same logic to the Wife’s shares in [C] Singapore; given that her 15% shareholding therein is three times more than her 5% shareholding in [C] Malaysia, the disparity can only be explained on the basis that it was meant as consideration for the Husband’s stake in [B] Pte Ltd.

First, the notion that the Wife’s father would distribute the shares in his companies in accordance with the formula above is based entirely on the shareholding distribution of a single company, [C] Malaysia. This is hardly sufficient to evince some sort of general pattern from which any deviation is explicable only on the basis of something akin to the alleged [B] Agreement. Indeed, the distribution of shares in [C] Singapore amongst the Wife’s siblings, with two of her brothers receiving 23%, one brother receiving 30%, and two sisters receiving 5%,

Whether this is a deliberate if poorly executed attempt on his part to distort the Wife’s evidence to suit his case, or the result of genuine inability to comprehend what he is reading, the end result is that it is extremely difficult to accord much if any weight to his evidence. For example, the Husband claimed that the Wife’s father once told him that “he had already transferred partially then my 50% stake sales of [B]” to the Wife.

But the manner in which he does so only serves to further undermine his case and his credibility. In this connection, it is important to appreciate how the Husband’s case concerning the [B] Agreement evolved between his first and second AOMs. In his first AOM filed on 9 May 2022, the Husband claims that “when [Wife’s father] is passing away – he will sure allocate further more <span class="font-italic">[D]</span><span class="font-italic"> or [D] Properties Bhd</span> shares to my former spouse to make up for my stake of [B] [emphasis added]”, and “in fact, during our course of marriage, my former wife told me of such arrangement”.

This suggests that the Husband is simply making an opportunistic attempt to lay claim to as many of the Wife’s assets as he can plausibly tie to the alleged [B] Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Finally, I also note that [C] Singapore was only incorporated in 2018, with the Wife receiving her shares therein shortly after.

</div> On the Husband’s own account, this is well over a decade after any alleged [B] Agreement would have been made. This significant duration makes it very difficult to believe that there was in fact any link between the transfer of the [B] shares to the Wife’s father, and the Wife’s receipt of the [C] Singapore shares. Indeed, this only strengthens the inference that the Husband is simply attempting to draw links between the [B] Agreement and as many of the Wife’s assets as possible, regardless of how tenuous those links might be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Accordingly, I find that the [D] shares and the shares in [C] Singapore were both simply gifts to the Wife by her father. I accept the Wife’s account as to why the transfer of the [B] stake took place, namely that the Husband simply lost interest in [B] Pte Ltd after starting [E] as mentioned above at [8], and for the reasons laid out above, I reject the Husband’s claim that it was carried out pursuant to any alleged [B] Agreement. The [D] shares and [C] Singapore shares, and the dividends therefrom, cannot be considered the Husband’s, or be attributed to him as his contributions to the marriage. The implications of this finding will be further explored in my analysis of how each individual asset ought to be divided. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate analytical approach  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Having dealt with the Husband’s specific claim in respect of the [B] Agreement, I turn to consider the appropriate analytical framework for determining how parties’ assets ought to be divided based on their respective contributions to the marriage.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The first question is whether the present marriage ought to be considered a dual-income or a single-income marriage. This distinction is significant because where a marriage is determined to be a dual-income marriage, the appropriate analytical approach for division of matrimonial assets would be the structured approach laid out in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>”). Under this approach, the court must determine (i) the ratio of parties’ respective direct contributions to the matrimonial assets, and (ii) the ratio of their indirect financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage (<span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>at [22]-[25]). The court will then average the two ratios, which may or may not be attributed equal weight, to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family (<span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On the other hand, <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>’s structured approach should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be applied to single-income marriages (<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) at [46]). This is because financial contributions are not only given recognition under the first step of the structured approach, which considers parties’ direct contributions to the matrimonial assets, but also the second step, which includes consideration of indirect financial contributions to the marriage. As a result, the working spouse may be accorded a substantial percentage under the second step even if they have made little or no non-financial contributions. This would unduly favour the working spouse and cause the non-working spouse to be doubly disadvantaged (<span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [44]). Consequently, in long single-income marriages, the court will tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets, while paying heed to precedent cases and retaining the discretion to deviate from perfect equality (<span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [48]; <span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>[2017] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">UBM</span>”) at [41], [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Here, it is undisputed that the Wife held full-time employment and was drawing a regular salary.

</div> Additionally, to the extent that his case is that his indirect financial contributions comprised dividends from the [D] shares, and/or [C] Malaysia, this would be premised on the notion that they ought rightfully to be attributed to him in the first place, a claim which I have found to be wholly without merit. All this leads to the conclusion that the Wife would have been the only one supporting the family financially. Insofar as the question whether a marriage is single-income or dual-income turns on a qualitative assessment of parties’ contributions, this would seem to weigh in favour of considering this a single-income marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, I am of the view that the better approach to the question whether a marriage ought to be considered single-income or dual-income is to focus on capacity to contribute rather than actual contributions. I find support for this in the following passage from <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [42], which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have no doubt that the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> approach works well in what, for the sake of convenience, we shall refer to as “Dual-Income Marriages”, <span class="font-italic font-underline">ie</span>, marriages where both spouses are working and are therefore <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">able</span> to make both direct and indirect financial contributions to the household. This was in fact the type of marriage before this court in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> itself… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I read this passage as placing the focus on whether parties are drawing an income and therefore <span class="font-italic">able</span> to make financial contributions towards the family, rather than whether they <span class="font-italic">actually </span>contributed that income towards the family. I regard this to be a more principled approach. It must be recalled that the reason why the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>structured approach should not be applied to single-income marriages is because to do so would unduly disadvantage the <span class="font-italic">non-working spouse</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">TN</span><span class="font-italic">L </span>at [44]). A focus on actual rather than potential capacity for financial contribution would allow a spouse who is drawing an income to avail himself of a more favourable methodology for division of assets, by simply declining to contribute such income towards the family and so rendering himself a “non-working spouse”. In my view, this would be neither just nor equitable, and inconsistent with the “spirit in which <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>was decided” (<span class="font-italic">UBM </span>at [49]).

</div> These investment activities should be regarded as constituting at least part of his occupation and corresponding income, and the Husband ought therefore be considered as having been employed and drawing an income, making this a dual-income marriage in respect of which the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>structured approach is to be applied in the division of matrimonial assets. That said, I also bear in mind that even where this approach is applicable, it is not intended to be used as a set of “hard and fast rules that must immutably be applied even to cases of exceptional facts”, and that its limitations can be avoided if it is instead simply “embraced as a useful guide to be exercised within a broad brush approach” (<span class="font-italic">UBM </span>at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Finally, I also must consider whether the matrimonial assets should be assessed as a single pool, or in distinct classes. The court may determine a just and equitable division of the entire pool of matrimonial assets in light of the parties direct and indirect contributions and all the circumstances of the case. This is known as the global assessment methodology. Alternatively, the court may employ the classification methodology, which entails dividing the matrimonial assets into distinct classes and determining a just and equitable division of each class or the value thereof (<span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [31]–[32]; <span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR and another matter </span>[2013] 1 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">AYQ</span>”) at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the present case, parties are in agreement that each asset ought to be considered separately from the others.

</div> Much like the Husband’s wanton adultery, his foul and domineering behaviour is another factor which is relevant in assessing parties’ indirect contributions to the marriage (<span class="font-italic">AVM v AWH</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1274 at [67(a)], [69], [78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the round, and bearing in mind that the court should not be further breaking down the second step of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> structured approach by assigning separate ratios for indirect financial and non-financial contributions (<span class="font-italic">TN</span><span class="font-italic">L </span>at [47]), I would assess the parties’ indirect contributions to be 80:20 in favour of the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I recognise that such a ratio might seem at odds with the trend towards equal division in long marriages, whether single-income or dual-income, and the underlying philosophy of marriage as an equal partnership (<span class="font-italic">UBM </span>at [66]; <span class="font-italic">TN</span><span class="font-italic">L </span>at [45]). However, I do not think that this is the case, and I begin by examining precedent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">WGE v WGF </span>[2023] SGHCF 26 (“<span class="font-italic">WGE</span>”), which involved a marriage of just over ten years, the court assessed parties’ indirect contributions at 70:30 in favour of the wife, who cared for the child of the marriage and the home without the help of a domestic helper or family members (at [158] and [162]). On the other hand, the husband was often away from home traveling for work, and the court made clear that “the fact that the Husband did spend some time with the child did not equate to his being an involved father” (at [159]). The court made clear that “where the wife has borne the bulk of the responsibility for the child(ren) of the marriage, the courts have tended to attribute to the wife a far higher percentage of the parties’ indirect contributions than 50% – even where the husband is the sole breadwinner” (at [160]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In coming to this conclusion, the court in <span class="font-italic">WGE </span>also conducted a comprehensive and succinct survey of several other cases in which the ratio of indirect contributions was heavily weighted towards one party. In <span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU and another appeal</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1137, parties indirect contributions were assessed at 35:65 in favour of a wife who had been the “sole anchor at home” (at [36]–[37]). In <span class="font-italic">UAP v UAQ</span> [2018] 3 SLR 319, a full-time homemaker’s indirect contributions were assessed at 80%, as her husband was often on overseas attachments and attending night classes, and focused on his piloting career as well as side businesses and other ventures (at [80]). In <span class="font-italic">TYS v TYT</span> [2017] 5 SLR 244, the wife’s indirect contributions were assessed at 75% owing to her role as the primary caregiver of the parties’ son who was on the autistic spectrum, and despite the fact that the husband had made “significant indirect financial contributions” (at [42]). Even where a husband was found in <span class="font-italic">TUV v TUW </span>[2016] SGHCF 15 to have “contributed to the family’s welfare in no small amount” by taking care of the home and the other children when one of them fell ill with cancer (at [40]), the wife was awarded 60% of indirect contributions. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT </span>[2017] 4 SLR 213, an “involved father” who made “significant indirect financial contributions” was awarded only 40% of indirect contributions (at [41]–[44]). It is generally in cases where there are no children to the marriage, that indirect contributions tend to be assessed on a more equal basis (<span class="font-italic">WGE </span>at [155]). And it cannot be overemphasised that in all these cases, as well as in <span class="font-italic">WGE </span>itself, the husband was contributing financially to the upkeep of the family. Surely a similarly favourable attribution of indirect contributions is due to a wife who has not only borne the bulk of the responsibility of caring for the children and providing for the family, but also the suffering caused by the Husband’s wanton infidelity and domineering nature.

</div> This is clearly untrue. According to the figures he provides, as of 1 May 2022, the Alibaba shares which he purchased at around US$170 to US$175 per share were worth US$97.09, and the Tencent shares purchased at prices ranging from US$48.55 to US$53.30 were worth US$47.07, yielding a total loss of over US$30,000.00. This is yet another inconsistency in the Husband’s evidence which undermines his credibility. Nevertheless, the understanding between the parties was that the investment portfolio would be managed by the Husband on behalf of the Wife and that she would enjoy any gains therefrom. The corollary is that any losses would also be hers to bear. The fact that it did not perform as well as she might have hoped, or as well as the Husband wanted the court to believe, does not change this. As there does not appear to be any reason not to give effect to parties’ original intentions in respect of this asset, I order that the Husband return the shares which he bought using the funds in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Wife’s loans to the Husband </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is not disputed that the Wife regularly loaned money to the Husband over the course of the marriage.

</div> Based on the Wife’s documents, which records some loans in Singapore dollars and some in Malaysian ringgit, the difference appears to turn on the exchange rate between the two currencies, with the Husband using an approximate exchange rate of 1 SGD to RM3.05269, and the Wife using an approximate exchange rate of 1 SGD to RM2.93785. Absent any evidence as to which I should prefer, and bearing in mind that these transactions took place over a period of several years, I adopt an approximate midpoint of S$1 to RM3, which yields a sum of S$1,093,695.39. This is the figure I shall adopt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Wife’s written submissions seem to suggest that she is also seeking the return of S$1,249,840.84 which she had “loaned to the Husband throughout the marriage”.

</div> the value of intellectual property does not cease to exist merely because the person holding it decides he no longer wishes to utilise it and would rather carry it to the grave. For the court to believe his assertion that [E] Plt is now worthless demands documentary evidence. This has not been provided. The same applies with equal force to the question how he acquired the funds to purchase the two Malaysian properties, which on his account were at least in part the source of the capital he used to build his main streams of income from investing. I therefore find that the necessary substratum of evidence has been established against the Husband, and that he is the only one in a position to supply the information necessary to plug the gaping holes in his evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The next question is what the effect of this adverse inference ought to be. As observed in <span class="font-italic">UZN </span>at [28], the court may give effect to an adverse inference in one of two ways. First, it may make a finding on the value of the undisclosed assets based on the available evidence, include that value in the matrimonial pool for division, and attribute it to the party against whom the adverse inference is being drawn. This is known as the quantification approach. Alternatively, the court may simply order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the other party, in what is known as the uplift approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the present case, there is simply insufficient material for me to make any finding as to the value of any allegedly undisclosed assets. This of course is in large part due to the Husband’s failure to make full and frank disclosure. However, I also find it somewhat unsatisfactory that even though the Wife asked for such an inference to be drawn, she did not venture any suggestion as to what the effect of that adverse inference ought to be.

</div> The only recourse left to me is to employ the uplift approach, which is the approach that has been taken in previous cases where there is insufficient evidence to determine the value of assets which are concealed or wrongly dissipated (<span class="font-italic">UZN </span>at [34]–[39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In this regard, I note that the pool of disputed assets which are properly considered matrimonial assets are simply the matrimonial home, [Condominium 2], and [Condominium 3]. As discussed above, a just and equitable division of these properties in view of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions would already see the Wife awarded 78.5% of the S$210,634.46 anticipated net value of the matrimonial home, and 90% of the combined S$5,755,000 value of [Condominium 2] and [Condominium 3], the total of which works out to be S$5,344,848.05, or approximately 89.6% (rounded to one decimal place) of the combined S$5,965,634.46 value of these three matrimonial assets, with the Husband receiving a total of 10.4% (rounded to one decimal place).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In view of the Wife’s preponderant majority share of the assets, I am of the view that a token uplift of 1% would be appropriate. This would amount to giving the Wife an additional S$59,656.34. While not an insignificant figure, it is far less than the last plausible recorded value of [E]/[E] Plt’s assets of RM391,867.51 plus the purchase price of RM959,000 the Husband paid for the two Malaysian properties, to say nothing of the income which the Husband probably did earn but failed to disclose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Accordingly, after the uplift of 1% in favour of the Wife, the Husband should expect to receive a total of S$560,769.64 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 9.4% of S$5,965,634.46) of the matrimonial pool.

</div>
</div> The Husband has made no submissions regarding the issue of costs. I thus turn to consider the applicable principles governing cost orders in matrimonial proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As a general rule, the default position is that costs are <span class="font-italic">not</span> ordered in respect of matrimonial proceedings (<span class="font-italic">JBB v JBA </span>[2015] 5 SLR 153 (“<span class="font-italic">JBB</span>”) at [24]–[25]). This is because, unlike in civil matters, it is not often clear that there is a clear “winner” or “loser” in matrimonial litigation (<span class="font-italic">JBB</span> at [28]). This is especially so where ancillary matters are concerned, an example being a situation in which both parties seek 70% of the matrimonial assets but the court orders that they be divided equally (<span class="font-italic">JBB </span>at [33]). Moreover, it is also preferable to avoid pronouncing a “winner” and a “loser”, thereby aggravating the bitterness and acrimony between parties. This is especially important where parties must continue to co-operate with each other to co-parent their children even after matrimonial proceedings have concluded (<span class="font-italic">JB</span><span class="font-italic">B </span>at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This is not to say that the court can <span class="font-italic">never</span> make a costs order in favour of one party over another. In determining whether and how to exercise its discretion to order costs, it is the conduct of the parties in the proceedings which will assume greater relevance. For example, a party who has been uncooperative in disclosing his assets and means is less likely to receive a favourable costs order (<span class="font-italic">JBB</span> at [33]). Costs may be ordered against parties who are found to have made patently unmeritorious allegations (<span class="font-italic">ET v ES </span>[2007] SGHC 152 at [24]). By the same token, those who are found to have incurred unnecessary costs will not be allowed to recover them even if costs are otherwise awarded in their favour (<span class="font-italic">NI v NJ</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75 at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my view, the present case is one in which it appears appropriate to make a costs order against the Husband. In his affidavits, the Husband went on at length attacking strawmen arguments, describing the differences between certain coffee varietals, and recounting stories about his brother-in-law, all of which were entirely irrelevant to the matters at hand.

</div>
</div> Furthermore, while it is difficult to identify a winner and loser where parties each seek 70% of the matrimonial assets in dispute and the court awards each 50%, the Husband’s case turned almost entirely on the alleged [B] Agreement. Having failed to establish its existence despite a prolix and confusing attempt to do so, it is difficult to see how he could <span class="font-italic">not</span> be regarded as having lost in the present matter. Finally, as noted above, he not only failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets and means, but persistently refused to abide by the court’s directions to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, even where there is a clear “winner” in matrimonial proceedings, the court has a discretion to decline to order costs against the “losing” party (<span class="font-italic">JBB </span>at [23]). I find that this is the appropriate course to take in the present case. For reasons discussed above at length, the Husband will receive a relatively small share of the matrimonial assets, and I note that the Wife does have considerable financial means at her disposal. Most importantly, while the parties’ children are both adults and co-parenting is no longer strictly an issue, it is clear that they both love their children, and that their children love them. There is therefore good reason to avoid exacerbating the hostility between the parties. I shall therefore make no order as to costs. It is hoped that this will allow them to preserve and rebuild what familial ties they still have between themselves and their children. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I thus turn to consider how best to give effect to the decisions I have made in respect of the assets discussed above.

</div> for the avoidance of doubt, the Husband is to bear 50% of the parties’ youngest daughter’s monthly expenses until she completes her undergraduate university education in September 2025. Per the Wife’s uncontested estimation, this would work out to be S$4,033.76. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As can be seen, in addition to the orders at [92(a)] and [92(b)] involving the transfer of property from the Husband to the Wife, the parties have been ordered to pay various sums to each other. I note that both had originally taken the position that the matrimonial home was to be sold, notwithstanding their disagreement over how the proceeds therefrom ought to be apportioned. However, I am of the view that the most expeditious way to give effect to these orders is simply to set off the sums to which they are each entitled against each other. The Husband is therefore to pay to the Wife a sum of S$473,946.64, being the S$1,093,695.39 which she loaned to the Husband for [E] as per [92(c)], less the [Condominium 1] maintenance fees of RM176,937.34 (converted to S$58,979.11 at RM3=S$1) as per [92(d)] and the Husband’s S$560,769.64 share of the matrimonial assets as per [92(e)]. This relieves the parties of the need to sell the matrimonial home. Having “bought” over the Husband’s share of the matrimonial home, the Husband would no longer have any interest therein, and it should be held solely by the Wife. Accordingly, my final orders are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband is to transfer to the Wife the shares held in his TD Ameritrade account which are traceable to the funds which she transferred to him to be invested on her behalf. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Husband is to immediately effect the transfer of [Condominium 1] to the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Husband is to pay to the Wife the sum of S$473,946.64.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Husband is to divest himself of his interest in the matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Husband is to pay to the Wife a sum of $4,033.76 on a monthly basis until September 2025, being maintenance for their youngest daughter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For avoidance of doubt, I make no order regarding the following assets, which shall therefore remain in the names of their current legal owners:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) [Condominium 4] </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) [Condominium 2] and [Condominium 3].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The [D] shares, the [C] Malaysia shares, and the [C] Singapore shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Wife’s Bursa Malaysia Depository Sdn Bhd and Maybank Premier 1 accounts.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Any of the assets whose ownership parties did not dispute in the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, for the reasons given above, I make no order as to costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Ang </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Kok Weng Mark, Sarah Yeo Qi Wei, Tan Shi Yuin Teri, and Gursharn Singh Gill s/o Amar Singh (WMH Law Corporation)  for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The defendant in person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
