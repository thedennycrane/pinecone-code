In <span class="font-italic">Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore)</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 501, the High Court held that misrepresentation by silence was possible but more than mere silence was needed. There must be a wilful suppression of material and important facts or “such a partial and fragmentary statement of fact that the withholding of that which is not stated makes that which is stated absolutely false” (at [66]–[67], citing Lord Cairns in <span class="font-italic">Peek v Gurney </span>[1861–73] All ER Rep 116 at 129). Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another</span> [2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna</span>”) held at [65]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is trite law that “mere silence, however morally wrong, will not support an action of deceit” … There can be no misrepresentation by omission, although active concealment of a particular state of affairs may amount to misrepresentation …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, for silence to be misrepresentation, it must be part of a factual matrix that includes the defendant making some positive statement or representation, but the silence consists in omitting to mention material facts within that statement or representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, although the standard of proof for an allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation is still based on a balance of probabilities (as in all civil cases), but because an allegation of fraud is a serious one, the party alleging fraud must furnish more evidence the graver his allegation. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna</span> also expressed this view at [30]–[31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 It is, in our view, of the first importance to emphasise right at the outset the <span class="font-italic">relatively high standard of proof</span> which must be satisfied by the representee (here, the Appellant) before a fraudulent misrepresentation can be established successfully against the representor (here, the Deceased). As V K Rajah JA put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Vita Health Laboratories Pte Ltd v Pang Seng Meng</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 162 (at [30]), the allegation of fraud is a serious one and that “[g]enerally speaking, the graver the allegation, the higher the standard of proof incumbent on the claimant”. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 This high standard of proof is also consistent with the fact that an award of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation covers a <span class="font-italic">wide</span> ambit – including all loss which flowed directly as a result of the entry by the representee into the transaction in question, <span class="font-italic">regardless of whether or not such loss was foreseeable</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Similar sentiments were expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But since fraud can also be the subject of a civil claim, the civil standard of proving on a balance of probabilities must apply because there is no known “third standard” although such cases are usually known as “fraud in a civil case” as if alluding to a third standard of proof. However, because of the severity and potentially serious implications attaching to a fraud, even in a civil trial, judges are not normally satisfied by that little bit more evidence such as to tilt the “balance”. They normally require more. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Therefore, we would reiterate that the standard of proof in a civil case, including cases where fraud is alleged, is that based on a balance of probabilities; but the more serious the allegation, the more the party, on whose shoulders the burden of proof falls, may have to do if he hopes to establish his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These sentiments are apposite in the present case since the plaintiffs allege that the defendants had, from the very beginning, marketed investments which they knew were not genuine and dishonestly constructed a scheme, including “forg[ing] financial documents” and making “positive efforts to conceal all evidence of fraud”,

Rather, this email is more significant in relation to the question of whether DW1 was part of this conspiracy, since he was the one who sent the email (which is a point I shall deal with later). As for DW2, besides being copied in the said email, there is no evidence that would suggest that he was party to the conspiracy. Instead, DW2’s testimony (which remained unscathed throughout cross-examination) was that he was never told by Ng and DW1 that there would be investors for the Autostyle investment because his role in JE Capital was only to run another subsidiary, GoodWater.

</div> There would of course be nothing wrong for Autostyle to give instructions to JE Capital to pay Autostyle’s creditor, Centurion, if the latter was a legitimate creditor. But Centurion in this case was not a creditor but a supplier. The payment that was made was also not the payment of an existing debt (or any other similar transaction to that effect) but was, rather, a loan. This is significant because when commercial parties make loans to each other, they typically do so on pre-agreed terms. These terms would include the principal sum, the interest rate, the repayment date, the creditor’s rights upon default, etc. None of these terms are apparent from this “loan”, given that it was entirely undocumented.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This complete lack of documentation is, to say the least, stunning. This was not a small sum but a purported loan of £1m! Furthermore, there is no evidence that either DW1 or JE Capital had ever dealt with Centurion prior to this case.

On 29 June 2014, Simal (on behalf of Autostyle) sent four banker’s guarantees to Ng by email.

Neither did he alert either Ng or the other investors who had received similar banker’s guarantees, which he would have known of since Ng had sent Simal’s email to DW1 when Ng was asking him to follow up with Ma’s banker’s guarantee. Given that all these banker’s guarantees related to the same Autostyle investment that had been entered into by the various investors on the same or similar terms, the natural and immediate reaction of a responsible and innocent underwriter of the Autostyle investment would have been to alert the investors at risk of fraud. Instead, DW1 instructed Ng via email to delete an email thread relating to the banker’s guarantee of another investor in Autostyle, Wang. The email thread that was sought to be deleted was titled “ABN AMRO BG of EUROS 1.5million (WANG HONG GANG)”, and DW1 wrote “THIS EMAIL NEEDS TO BE BURNED FROM OUR SERVER” [emphasis in original].

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I am completely unconvinced by DW1’s explanation. DW1’s reaction is inconsistent with his contention that he did not know about the BG, and that he was not involved in any conspiracy with Ng to defraud the investors. If Ng was behind the scheme to defraud PW1, then the instruction to destroy incriminating evidence should have come from Ng and not DW1. Instead, it was DW1 and not Ng who directed that the email be burned from the server. DW1’s behaviour upon the discovery of the forged banker’s guarantee was not consistent with his portrayal of himself as an innocent person who was not part of the conspiracy to defraud PW1. His reaction was also inconsistent with the behaviour of an innocent businessman who only later discovered that the banker’s guarantees were forged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To the contrary, I find that DW1’s reactions, especially seen in the light of how important these banker’s guarantees were, indicate that DW1 was in the know all along. These banker’s guarantees were purportedly sent by Simal from Autostyle for people who had invested in Autostyle. DW1 and Ng were directors of JE Investments and the underwriters of this Autostyle investment, and they were actively marketing this investment product. They knew that the banker’s guarantees were very important to the investors as the guarantees would safeguard their investments which appeared risky as it had a very high interest returns of 15% per annum. An innocent and responsible underwriter who was not involved in the sham investment would have quickly alerted those who had invested in the Autostyle investment as large sums were involved. He would also have immediately checked with the issuers of the banker’s guarantees (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Simal) to find out what was happening and to seek an explanation. As forgery of a banking instrument is a very serious criminal offence, an innocent underwriter who was unable to solicit a satisfactory explanation would have advised the affected investors to lodge a police report. DW1 did none of these. Instead, he did the complete opposite: he took steps to cover up and attempt to destroy evidence that suggested that the banker’s guarantees were forged, and remained silent, not alerting PW1 and the other affected investors. All of the above indicate that DW1 was not an innocent underwriter. It also suggests that, on a balance of probabilities, he did know that the banker’s guarantees, including the BG meant for PW1, were forged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It must also be emphasised that both DW1 and Ng were actively involved in the marketing of the Autostyle investment, albeit to different investors. DW1 personally marketed the Autostyle investment to Ma and Wang, who were also given banker’s guarantees. Hence, although DW1 did not directly market the Autostyle investment to PW1, this is similar fact evidence that is relevant and admissible under ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Although most of the cases pertaining to similar fact evidence were decided in the criminal context, <span class="font-italic">Rockline Ltd and others v Anil Thadani and others</span> [2009] SGHC 209 (“<span class="font-italic">Rockline</span>”)

I agree with this statement of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Applying this test to the facts before me, I find that the evidence relating to Ma’s and Wang’s banker’s guarantees is admissible.

I have to exercise caution in relation to references to their investments so that the hearsay rule is not breached.

A discovery order was granted on Ng’s OCBC bank account which showed that Ng had received S$480,915 from the Autostyle transactions from June to September 2014.

</div> respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I accept that these payments were made to DW1 but I do not think that they show that the payments were made to DW1 for the same reasons that the payments were made to Ng and PW3. In the ledger accounts that was cited to me by the plaintiffs, there was an entry under the “credit” column dated 31 December 2013 under the heading “EUJIN-BONUS-YEAR2013” for a sum of S$235,000. The entries of S$250,000 and S$50,000 then came right after. In my view, the more logical explanation for these payments was that DW1 had been promised certain year-end bonuses which had yet to be paid (which is why they were indicated in the “credit” column). The sums advanced were simply to pay off these bonuses and other sums in the “credit” column, of which there were more. Indeed, when I queried the plaintiffs’ counsel as to what was the plaintiffs’ position or explanation in relation to the similar sum of S$235,000 in the “credit” column, the plaintiffs’ counsel could not give any. Hence, I do not agree with the plaintiffs that DW1 was given any kickbacks in the way that Ng and PW3 were given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  However, the lack of additional payments over and above DW1’s salary and bonuses does not necessarily mean that DW1 was not part of the conspiracy. In this case, as I have already noted, DW1 directed payment of £1m from the Autostyle investment to Centurion. This sum was not reflected in the account books of JE Capital. The purported loan to Centurion was also not reflected in JE Capital’s financial statements. To date, DW1 has not explained what became of this sum. There is no evidence that the £1m purported loan was repaid, or that any action was taken to recover this enormous sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The kickbacks that were purportedly furtively received by Ng and PW3 merely suggest that they had enriched themselves unbeknown to DW1. This is a separate issue between them. But I have to consider whether on the balance of probabilities, bearing in mind that more evidence is required for a cause of action under fraud, this lack of receipt of kickbacks by DW1 suggests that he did not conspire with Ng to defraud the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The evidence that I examined earlier in relation to DW1 is largely circumstantial and the totality of that evidence suggests that he and Ng were involved in a conspiracy to defraud PW1 in relation to the Autostyle investment.

</div> Belinda Ang Saw Ean J noted at [47] that “in conspiracy cases of this type, it would be remarkable for various conspirators to regulate the arrangements as between themselves in a formal manner”; hence, the agreement or combination “is to be inferred from the evidence”. In describing this flexible approach that ought to be taken by the court, Ang J adopted the analysis in <span class="font-italic">R v Siracusa</span> (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at 349 (notwithstanding that it was in the criminal law context) that participation in such a conspiracy “is infinitely variable: it can be active or passive”. Hence, even though the plaintiffs did not produce evidence pertaining to acts prior to PW1 entering into the Autostyle transaction, DW1’s reaction to the forged banker’s guarantees and his use of PW1’s money sufficiently indicate what his state of mind or understanding was <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Autostyle investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The ambit of the rule that conspiracy can be inferred from the evidence was further discussed in <span class="font-italic">The Dolphina</span> [2012] 1 SLR 992.

I also adopt this statement of the law. The fact that the kickbacks were not known nor given to DW1 while they were given to Ng and PW3 is no barrier to my finding that DW1 was part of the conspiracy, since he did not need to know the extent of Ng’s and PW3’s participation or benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Accordingly, I find that the evidence, although largely circumstantial, is sufficient to discharge the plaintiffs’ burden of proof that DW1 was part of the conspiracy with Ng, wherein the latter made the fraudulent misrepresentations to PW1 to induce him to enter into the Autostyle investment. Indeed, although Ng was the primary actor and DW1 was not directly involved in making representations to PW1, and although the party that PW1 had relied on during the course of these negotiations was PW3, both DW1 and Ng were marketing the Autostyle investment to <span class="font-italic">any</span> investors who were interested and PW1 just happened to be approached by Ng in this case.

</div> Apart from the alleged second tranche payment (which was eventually found to have never been made, a point which I shall deal with later), DW1 (and JE Capital) did not take any steps to remedy these risks and did not even inform the plaintiffs of the said risks. Eventually, DW1 had to call off the VDPL investment “personally” in July 2015 as he alleged that Ng was stuck in China and he was worried at that time about the “various representations” that Ng had made.

PW1 was particularly interested as he had already invested in the Autostyle investment that had previously been marketed by JE Capital, which had even larger returns of 15% per annum. By this time, PW1 had already received S$75,000 for his Autostyle investment in September 2014. This made him believe that the VDPL investment was also legitimate. Thus he asked PW2, his father, to join him in the VDPL investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 DW1 did not only fail to object to misleading materials being sent to PW1, but also played an active role in marketing the investment to PW2.

</div> Thereafter, DW1 did not take any action to confront Ng or to find out why the VDPL receipt vouchers were forged, nor did he alert the plaintiffs of the forgery. Forging the VDPL receipt vouchers is very serious, yet DW1 did not refer the case to the police. Instead, DW1 decided to abandon the VDPL investment in July 2015. He must have realised by then that the sham VDPL investment had been exposed. This indicates that DW1 and Ng were in the same conspiracy to defraud investors like the plaintiffs. It appears that DW1’s reaction to the forged receipt vouchers was similar to his reaction to the exposed banker’s guarantees in the Autostyle investment, regarding which I found that DW1 and Ng had conspired to defraud PW1 and other investors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) DW1’s use of the plaintiffs’ S$3m paid to JE Capital confirms that there was a conspiracy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The use of the plaintiffs’ S$3m further illuminates the illegitimacy of the VDPL investment.

The plaintiffs submit that the fact that DW1 (on behalf of JE Capital) had started preparing such payments before the plaintiffs’ money had come in, particularly when JE Capital had such a low balance in its account, suggests that the VDPL investment was not genuine and that the funds were meant to be siphoned out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In contrast, DW1 took the position that although the plaintiffs’ S$3m had indeed been used for the repayment of directors’ loans, this was entirely legitimate due to cl 4 of the respective contracts between the plaintiffs and JE Capital. These loan agreements gave JE Capital a wide discretion over the use of the S$3m. DW1 says that cl 4 in particular “allows the director[s] to have sole discretion to how they would use the working capital”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I do not accept DW1’s submission that cl 4 gave JE Capital and its directors an unfettered power to use the money that was transferred for the purpose of the VDPL investment. It is trite that a contractual term must be interpreted according to its plain meaning and also in its proper context, bearing in mind the purpose of the contract. Where possible, the different parts of the clause must be read in a way that does not render any other part of the clause nugatory. This is because the parties are taken to have wanted each and every part of the clause to be useful. In other words, the parties’ intentions are reflected in the precise language of the agreement. In this case, both parts of cl 4 must be read together. Clause 4.1 provides for three different limbs that may comprise the “purpose” of the loan. Clause 4.2 follows this by saying that the loan shall be disbursed “for the abovementioned purpose in such proportion and manner [as] the Borrower [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JE Capital] may decide at its sole discretion”. The operative phrase that DW1 relied on for JE Capital’s unfettered power is the last phrase, “at its sole discretion”. There are two possible interpretations of this last phrase in the clause:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) JE Capital has the absolute discretion to use the loan as it deems fit, even if the money is used for a purpose that is not connected or related to the purpose of the loan (which is the interpretation that DW1 contends for); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) JE Capital must disburse the loan for the purposes related to the VDPL investment, although it has the discretion to choose how much to disburse at any one time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The second interpretation of cl 4 is correct, because it more accurately reflects the intention of the contracting parties at the time when they entered the contract, assuming that the plaintiffs intended to enter into a legitimate loan agreement. If option (a) is right and JE Capital can disburse the loan for any purpose that it sees fit, then there would be no point in the parties listing the relevant purposes of the loan in cl 4.1. Furthermore, if the parties had intended option (a), they could have omitted the words “for the abovementioned purpose” altogether. In fact, it would suffice to say, “The Loan shall be disbursed as the Borrower may decide at its sole discretion.” As it stands, however, cl 4.2 clearly restricts the disbursement of the loan to the purposes stated in cl 4.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Accordingly, I do not accept DW1’s contention that cl 4 gives JE Capital the power to pay out the S$3m transferred by the plaintiffs for whatever purposes it pleases. The plaintiffs would not have invested or loaned money to JE Capital if they had known that their entire S$3m would be used to pay the outstanding loans to the directors and outstanding salary and bonuses of its shareholders (including DW2). This would leave practically no money for the VDPL investment and the plaintiffs cannot be taken to have intended this outcome in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Hence, the evidence indicates that after November 2014, DW1 knew that the VDPL investment was no longer legitimate. The eventual amount of money that was needed to complete the purchase of the VDPL shares was S$6,668,000 (see [88] above). Of this amount, only S$3m had been advanced thus far, as can be seen from the bank accounts of JE Capital right before the plaintiffs’ money was received on 3 December 2014. Even after the plaintiffs’ S$3m was deposited into JE Capital’s account, the money was quickly depleted by the loan repayments, such that by 9 December 2014 only S$58,058.10 remained in the account. But JE Capital continued spending and by the close of December 2014, only S$19,516.26 remained in its account.

</div> This is not conduct that one would expect of a company (or its directors) that was truly intent on purchasing 95% of the shares in VDPL, which cost some S$6.7m. It is inconceivable that JE Capital would so quickly and flippantly spend S$3m – nearly half of what was required – despite having close to nothing in its own bank account. This showed that by November and December 2014, DW1 and Ng did not have the intention to continue with the VDPL investment. Otherwise, they would not have used the plaintiffs’ S$3m for their own benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I do not accept DW1’s explanation that it was expecting another injection of funds in the near future and therefore JE Capital was comfortable in spending the S$3m, as there is no evidence to this effect. On the contrary, the plaintiffs adduced evidence of other agreements that JE Capital entered into with third party investors for the VDPL investment. The next injection of funds was shown to be on 5 March 2015 for the sum of S$250,000

</div> This dismissive treatment of what would have been an important source of funds to realise JE Capital’s plan to acquire the VDPL shares suggests to me that DW1 may not have considered that the plan was to complete the share acquisition to begin with. This is consistent with DW1’s reaction to finding out about the problems with the VDPL investment (see [88]–[93] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Conclusion on DW1’s conspiracy with Ng to defraud the plaintiffs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 From the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have also discharged the burden of proof against DW1 for conspiring with Ng to defraud the plaintiffs in the VDPL investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Indeed, when the Autostyle and VDPL investments are considered together, they reveal a common <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>of DW1 and Ng. They marketed these bogus businesses to lure potential investors like the plaintiffs with exorbitantly high returns which were too good to be true. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs were enticed by DW1’s and Ng’s shenanigans and now face dim prospects of making a full financial recovery.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">JE Capital’s involvement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 JE Capital, as a corporate entity, is the third defendant. It could not engage the plaintiffs except through the actions of DW1 and DW2. I have already found that DW2 is not liable for both the Autostyle and VDPL investments. But I have found that DW1 is liable for having conspired with Ng to defraud the plaintiffs for both these investments. DW1 and Ng were acting in their capacity as JE Capital’s directors in these investments. Therefore, I find that JE Capital is jointly and severally liable with DW1 for the two investments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In summary, I am of the view that there is insufficient evidence to implicate or link DW2 to the Autostyle and VDPL investments. DW2 was not involved in the marketing of these two investments. I am also satisfied that despite having received S$313,994 on 3 December 2014, which is traceable to the plaintiff's’ S$3m funds for the VDPL investment, DW2 did not conspire with DW1 and Ng to defraud the plaintiffs in relation to either investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 However, I find that DW1 is liable for conspiracy in relation to both investments, although he is not liable for fraudulent misrepresentations in relation to the Autostyle investment. I first summarise my findings in relation to DW1’s involvement in the Autostyle investment as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) DW1 is not liable for fraudulent misrepresentations relating to the Autostyle investment as PW1 dealt primarily with Ng in relation to this investment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Nevertheless, I find that DW1 conspired with Ng to defraud PW1, for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) There were too many internal discrepancies in the ASA and AN, which DW1 was unable to explain even though he was given a chance to do so. He could not have been unaware of the investment that he was marketing. This indicates that the Autostyle investment was not genuine.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) These discrepancies were corroborated by DW1’s admission that he made false statements in relation to the Autostyle investment in the Autostyle investment prospectus, even though they were made to other investors, and not PW1.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) PW1’s investment of US$1m and Ma’s investment were not recorded in JE Capital’s financial statements. These raised serious doubts about the authenticity of the investment.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) PW1’s US$1m was used as part of an undocumented and unapproved loan to Centurion, a company which JE Capital had never dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) When DW1 discovered that the banker’s guarantees were forged, instead of taking steps to remedy the situation, he issued instructions to Ng to “burn” an email relating to the banker’s guarantee of Wang, another Autostyle investor.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) Although DW1 did not receive kickbacks unlike Ng and PW3, this did not preclude the possibility of him having conspired with Ng to defraud the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The following summarises my findings in relation to DW1’s involvement in the VDPL investment:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no evidence that the VDPL investment had started off as a sham investment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the VDPL investment soon started facing problems. In September 2014, JE Capital’s lawyers informed DW1 and Ng of the rising costs of the VDPL investment and the increased exposure. A due diligence report also indicated that there were increased risks. DW1 and Ng did not inform the plaintiffs of these risks but continued to persuade them to enter the VDPL investment in November 2014 by the following actions:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) DW1 fraudulently misrepresented the nature and risks of the VDPL investment to PW2 during the meeting in Taiwan.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Although DW1 did not directly engage PW1 face-to-face unlike with PW2, DW1 still allowed the term sheet and other materials about the VDPL investment to be passed to PW3 with the intention that it would be forwarded to PW1. These materials also contained misleading information and this also constituted fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) DW1 and Ng were also in a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiffs given the following events:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) As mentioned, in September 2014 DW1 and Ng knew about the rising costs and increased risks associated with the VDPL investment but did not inform the plaintiffs. DW1 went further and marketed the VDPL investment directly to PW2 during their meeting in Taiwan in November 2014, and allowed materials (including the term sheet) to be sent to PW1 through PW3.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) During this time, Ng issued three forged receipt vouchers to reassure the plaintiffs that the VDPL investment was afoot and that all was well. The vouchers referred to the previous amount required to finance the VDPL investment – S$950,000. DW1 knew by this time that the investment required much more money, but remained silent. This indicates that he knew that the vouchers were forged.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Once the plaintiffs transferred their S$3m to JE Capital, DW1 and Ng immediately transferred the monies out to themselves. DW1 attempted to justify these transfers but there is no conceivable reason why a company which now needed some S$6.7m to finance its VDPL investment would immediately spend S$3m, nearly half the required amount. This is especially suspicious since apart from this S$3m, JE Capital had close to no funds in its bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Finally, I also find that the plaintiffs have proven their case against JE Capital, the third defendant, as DW1 and Ng were its directors. For the reasons stated above, I allow the plaintiffs’ claims in part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I shall now hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Nawaz Kamil (Providence Law<br/>Asia LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Lee Ming Hui Kelvin and Ong Xin Ying Samantha <br/>(WNLEX LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant in person;<br/>The third defendant unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
