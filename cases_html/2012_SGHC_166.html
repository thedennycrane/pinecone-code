        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       I had before me an application to set aside two
                    arbitration awards made in an international arbitration conducted under the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).
                    The first award dealt substantively with the dispute whilst the second dealt
                    with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The central issue the plaintiff, Quarella SpA
                    (“Quarella”), wanted me to decide was this: Does a purportedly
                    wrong interpretation of the choice of law clause (chosen by the parties to
                    govern their distributorship agreement) by a tribunal justify a setting aside of
                    an award under Articles 34(2)(a)(iii)-34(2)(a)(iv) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on
                    International Commercial Arbitration ("the Model Law")? The basis of the
                    plaintiff’s application was that the tribunal had failed to apply the
                    rules of law that were agreed upon by the parties to govern the merits of the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In its Originating Summons, Quarella had also
                    alleged that the rules of natural justice were breached in connection with the
                    making of the first award and that its rights had been prejudiced thereby. This
                    ground for setting aside the first award was, however, abandoned at the start of
                    the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the conclusion of the hearing I dismissed the
                    application. I now set out my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Quarella is a company incorporated in Italy
                    which manufactures and exports composite stone products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendant, Scelta Marble Australia Pty Ltd
                    (“Scelta”), is a company incorporated in Australia which supplies
                    composite stone products in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the proceedings before me, the President of
                    Quarella, Giuseppe Godi (“Mr Godi”), filed two affidavits. The
                    Managing Director of Scelta, Stewart Macciolli (“Mr Macciolli”),
                    filed one affidavit. There was also a legal opinion from Professor Marco
                    Torsello, a professor at the Department of Law of the University of Verona in
                    Italy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Quarella and Scelta entered into a
                    distributorship agreement (“the Agreement”) dated 27 January 2000
                    for the distribution of Quarella’s products in Australia. The Agreement
                    provided, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Clause 25</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Agreement shall be governed by the Uniform Law for International
                        Sales under the United Nations Convention of April 11, 1980 (Vienna) and
                        where not applicable by Italian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Clause 26</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any dispute which might arise shall be decided by arbitration to be
                        carried out in Singapore in English according to the rules of the
                        International Chamber of Commerce of Paris.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       A dispute subsequently arose. Scelta filed a
                    Request for Arbitration dated 19 October 2009 with the Paris Secretariat of the
                    International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) International Court of
                    Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 10 December 2009, Associate Professor Gary
                    F Bell was nominated jointly by Quarella and Scelta to be the sole arbitrator.
                    On 17 February 2010, the Secretary General of the ICC International Court of
                    Arbitration, pursuant to Article 9(2) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration, confirmed
                    Associate Professor Gary Bell as the sole arbitrator (“the
                    Tribunal”). The parties and the Tribunal subsequently agreed on the Terms
                    of Reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 11 November 2011, the Tribunal issued a
                    Partial Award on All Substantive Issues in Dispute (Final as to All Matters
                    Except Costs) (“the Award”). The Award was in Scelta’s
                    favour and Quarella was ordered to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    pay A$1,075,964.25 to Scelta as damages for Quarella’s wrongful
                    termination and breach of the Agreement. On 22 December 2011, the Tribunal
                    issued a Final Award (on Costs) (“the Costs Award”) which awarded
                    Scelta costs fixed at A$824,917.50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As at the date of the hearing before me,
                    Quarella had not made any payment towards settlement of the Award or the Costs
                    Award. Scelta was attempting to enforce the Award in Italy but this attempt was
                    resisted by Quarella on the basis that it was seeking to set aside the Award in
                    Singapore, the supervisory jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Tribunal’s decision on the applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The question as to what the law applicable to
                    the arbitration was, did not at first appear to be in doubt. Scelta took the
                    position that Italian law applied rather than the Uniform Law for International
                    Sales (“CISG”) under the 1980 UN Vienna Convention and Quarella
                    seemed to agree. In Quarella’s Answer to the Request for Arbitration, it
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact the [CISG] has a limited application, as it does not govern
                        expressly distributorship agreements, which is a framework agreement, but
                        the sales to which it refers to. In this arbitration therefore we shall
                        mostly refer to (and rely on) Italian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Scelta pointed out in its submissions that
                    Quarella had, from a very early stage of the arbitration, accepted that Italian
                    law was the law applicable to the merits of the dispute. Scelta argued that it
                    was clear from the excerpt that Quarella considered and accepted that the CISG
                    did not apply to the Agreement, which was described as a “Distributorship
                    Agreement”. Scelta also argued that Quarella exclusively referred to and
                    relied on Italian law in its subsequent submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     But Quarella changed its stand. In a letter
                    dated 15 April 2011, Quarella’s Australian solicitors, Baker &amp;
                    McKenzie stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 25 of the Agreement constitutes a direct choice by the parties of
                        CISG as the “rules of law” to determine the dispute between
                        the parties pursuant to Article 28 of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By virtue of that agreement between the parties, relevant provisions of
                        CISG (including Articles 7-8 and Articles 74 and 77) apply consistently with
                        the parties’ express choice of CISG as the primary rules of law
                        applicable to the [Agreement].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This change of position took place three weeks
                    before the re-scheduled hearing of the arbitration. As a result, Scelta objected
                    to Quarella raising the application of the CISG at such a late stage in the
                    arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Tribunal decided three preliminary issues
                    prior to determining the main issue of whether the CISG applied to the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The first was whether arguments that the CISG
                    applied should be heard at such a late stage. On this, the Tribunal allowed
                    Quarella to raise the new argument on the applicable law and gave Scelta an
                    opportunity to reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The second preliminary issue was whether the
                    agreement of the parties on the applicable law found in Clause 25 of the
                    Agreement was modified by mutual agreement so that the CISG did not apply. On
                    this, the Tribunal found that there was no modification of Clause 25 to
                    completely exclude the application of the CISG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The third preliminary issue was whether Clause
                    25 of the Agreement should be interpreted as a direct choice of the substantive
                    rules of the CISG by the parties so that the CISG applied even if the conditions
                    for the application of the CISG stated in the CISG were not met. On this, the
                    Tribunal decided that the correct interpretation of Clause 25 was that the
                    parties intended the CISG to apply to the extent that the CISG was applicable
                    according to its own rules on applicability, and if it did not apply in part or
                    in whole, then Italian law applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Having decided the above, the Tribunal then
                    considered the issue of whether the CISG, according to its own internal
                    criteria, applied to the Agreement. On this, the Tribunal decided that the CISG
                    was not applicable because the Agreement did not contain a contract of sale but
                    was a framework agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Quarella’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Quarella’s counsel, Mr Ang Wee Tiong
                    (“Mr Ang”) submitted that the Tribunal’s decision on the
                    applicable law was wrong, and that the Tribunal failed to apply the law chosen
                    by the parties. Quarella’s submission on this contained three points.
                    First, Quarella noted that by cl 26 of the Agreement, the parties had agreed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any dispute which might arise shall be decided by arbitration to be
                        carried out in Singapore in English according to the rules of the
                        International Chamber of Commerce of Paris.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Quarella pointed out that Art 17 of the ICC Rules provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties shall be free to agree upon the rules of law to be applied by
                        the Arbitral Tribunal to the merits of the dispute. In the absence of any
                        such agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal shall apply the rules of law which it
                        determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Quarella then went on to argue that the option
                    given to parties was not limited to the election of a national law, and that
                    parties could also use a different set of rules, including otherwise non-binding
                    principles (such as the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial
                    Contracts), or otherwise non-applicable conventions, such as the CISG in cases
                    where it would not apply on the basis of the rules on its
                applicability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, Quarella submitted that it was a well
                    established principle of contractual interpretation that a construction which
                    entailed that a contract and its performance was lawful and effective was to be
                    preferred, and referred to <em>Sheng Siong Supermarket Pte Ltd v
                        Carilla Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1094 at [40]. Quarella argued that
                    the Tribunal had, in deciding that the CISG was not applicable because the
                    Agreement did not contain a contract of sale but was instead a framework
                    agreement, deprived Clause 25 of any effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Third, Quarella argued that Italian law was to
                    be used to supplement the CISG when there was a lacuna, and was not intended to
                    replace the CISG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     These three arguments appeared to me to be
                    arguments that invited this court to review the merits of the Award and come to
                    a different conclusion from that of the Tribunal. Professor Torsello’s
                    instructions, given to him by Quarella, also sought answers that went to the
                    findings of the Tribunal. In his affidavit, Professor Torsello stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have been asked by the Plaintiff to consider and give my
                        opinion on the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Whether the Tribunal’s finding on the
                                issue of the applicable law is correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    If the Tribunal’s finding is incorrect,
                                what provision(s) of the CISG could and should have been applicable
                                to the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    What difference(s) would it have made to the
                                Partial Award if the provision(s) of the CISG had been applied by
                                the Tribunal instead of Italian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Assuming Professor Torsello is correct in his
                    opinion (on which I make no comment), and the Tribunal has erred, there can be
                    no right of appeal against such errors, independent of the Act (see, <em>Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Company
                        (Pte) Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1 at [19]-[22], applying the Court of
                    Appeal’s decisions in P<em>T Asuransi </em><em>Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                    597 ("<em>PT Asuransi</em>") and <em>Soh
                        </em><em>Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount
                        Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86). Mr Ang, in oral

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Scelta’s counsel, Mr Cavinder Bull SC
                    (“Mr Bull”), submitted that the arguments put forward by Quarella
                    were not being advanced with any real seriousness. In addition, Mr Maciolli
                    stated in his affidavit that Quarella was in a precarious financial position (an
                    allegation Mr Godi described as misconceived) and the present application was an
                    attempt to frustrate Scelta’s enforcement of the Award.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that the Arbitral Tribunal <em>fails</em> to apply the law chosen by the parties, there may be a
                        risk, at least in some jurisdictions, that the Award will be set aside.
                        Indeed, this occurred in a non-ICC arbitration in Egypt upon an Egyptian
                        court’s finding that the Arbitral Tribunal had failed to apply the law
                        agreed by the parties, as required by Egyptian law (an adapted version of
                        the UNCITRAL Model Law). <em>See In the Matter of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus, Article 53(1) of Egypt’s 1994 Law on Arbitration
                        contains the two following uniquely local grounds for the annulment of
                        awards in addition to those of Article 34 of the Model Law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) if the arbitral award fails to apply the law agreed by the parties
                            to the subject matter of the dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) if nullity occurs in the arbitral award, or if the arbitral
                            proceedings are tainted by nullity affecting the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>This kind of tampering was bound to lead to trouble,
                            and so it did: in the now-infamous Chromalloy case in which the Cairo
                            Court of Appeal set aside an ICC award on the basis of paragraph
                            (d).</em> To reach this result, the Court first determined that
                        the contract properly fell under the category of administrative contracts,
                        and that therefore the contractual reference to “Egypt Law”
                        (sic) should be understood as an acceptance of the exclusive application of
                        Egyptian administrative law. The arbitral tribunal had instead applied the
                        Egyptian Civil Code. <em>It had thus failed, in the
                            Court’s opinion, to apply the law agreed by the parties, and
                            therefore run afoul of Article 53(1)(d).</em> American and French
                        courts, asked to enforce the award notwithstanding the Egyptian annulment,
                        granted the applications, holding that the Egyptian court judgment did not
                        impair the award for the purposes of the enforcement forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Several points can be made from the excerpts
                    cited. First, with respect to the <em>Chromalloy</em> case
                    cited in <em>Derains and Schwartz</em> and <em>Craig, Park, Paulsson</em>, there is no equivalent to Article
                    53(1)(d) in Singapore’s arbitration law. Second, the learned authors of
                        <em>Born</em> and <em>Craig, Park,
                        Paulsson</em> and <em>Derains and Schwartz</em>
                    use the words “fails to apply”, “express refusal [to
                    apply]”, and “respect [the choice of the applicable law]”.
                    The facts of the present case did not take it within the situation referred to
                    by the learned authors where there is a failure to apply the choice of law
                    clause or an express refusal to apply the said clause. The Tribunal in this case
                    respected the choice of law clause chosen by the parties, interpreted the law so
                    chosen and came to the conclusion that the CISG did not apply and Italian law
                    applied. In the Award, the Tribunal took pains to explain the process by which
                    he derived the applicable law. I set out the relevant portions of the Award (at
                    [42] – [53] of the Award):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The applicable law</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 17 of the ICC Rules states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“<em>The parties shall be free to agree upon the
                            rules of law to be applied by the Arbitral Tribunal to the merits of the
                            dispute. In the absence of any such agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal
                            shall apply the rules of law which it determines to be
                            appropriate.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As mentioned above, the Contract contains the following choice of law
                        clause:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“<em>25. This Agreement shall be governed by the
                            Uniform Law for International Sales under the United Nations Convention
                            of April 11, 1980 (Vienna) and where not applicable by Italian
                            law.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not contested by the parties that the full and exact name of the
                        Convention referred to in clause 25 of the Contract is the “<em>United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                            Sale of Goods</em>” signed in Vienna on 11 April 1980 and
                        commonly known in English as the CISG [hereinafter: the CISG].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On page 3 of its Answer to the Request for Arbitration the Respondent
                        wrote: “In fact the [CISG] has a limited application, as it does not
                        govern expressly distributorship agreements, which is a framework agreement,
                        but the sales to which it refers to [sic]. In this arbitration therefore we
                        shall mostly refer to (and rely on) Italian law.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both the Claimant and, more importantly, the Respondent then proceeded to
                        argue their case in their Memoranda and Replies on the basis of Italian law
                        without any reference whatsoever to the CISG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Respondent even provided an expert witness on Italian law who
                        addressed the issue of good faith, termination, damages and mitigation under
                        Italian law without ever mentioning the same issue under the CISG (which is
                        part of Italian law).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Witness statement of Franco Vicario, 20 December 2010, Respondent’s

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, on 15 April 2011, only 24 days before the rescheduled hearing,
                        and well after the hearing originally scheduled for February 2011, counsel
                        for the Respondent informed the Tribunal and the Claimant by letter that
                        they intended to argue that the CISG, and in particular its articles 7, 8,
                        74 and 77, applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This letter therefore came after counsel for the Respondent had based its
                        argument in its Memorandum and its Reply on the fact that Italian law was
                        the governing law and that Italian law governed the issue of good faith
                        (counsel had not argued article 7 of the CISG), the interpretation of
                        contract (counsel had not argued article 8 of the CISG), the issue of
                        damages (counsel had not argued article 74 of the CISG) and of mitigation
                        (counsel had not argued article 77 of the CISG).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Claimant objected to the introduction of arguments that the CISG
                        applies at the late stage of the proceedings, first in a letter dated 3 May
                        2011 and then again on the first day of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the hearing, the Tribunal heard arguments on, and decided
                        three preliminary matters with respect to the possible application of the
                        CISG, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Whether arguments that the CISG applies should
                                even be heard at such a late stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Whether the agreement of the parties on the
                                applicable law found in Clause 25 of the contract was modified by
                                mutual agreement so that the CISG did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    Whether Clause 25 of the Contract should be
                                interpreted as a direct choice of the substantive rules of the CISG
                                by the parties so that the CISG applies even if the conditions for
                                the application of the CISG stated in the CISG are not
                            met.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After deciding these preliminary issues, the Tribunal heard the parties at
                        the hearing on the main issue of whether the CISG applied to the Contract
                        and reserved its decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal will first briefly restate its decisions and reasons on the
                        three preliminary issues and will then decide on the main issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Tribunal decided the third preliminary
                    issue as such (at [61]-[72],[74]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Respondent suggested that the CISG was applicable “not because
                        it has been incorporated as part of Italian law. Rather, it applies because
                        that is what the parties have explicitly instructed the arbitral Tribunal to
                        apply [...]”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Respondent’s Opening Submissions on the Vienna Convention dated 9
                        May 2011 at paragraph 11]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Respondent seemed to suggest that the rules on the applicability of
                        the CISG are not relevant because clause 25 should be interpreted as a
                        direct choice of rules; i.e. that the substantive rules of the CISG would be
                        applicable even if the CISG rules on its own applicability would indicate
                        that the CISG does not apply, for example, to distribution agreements
                        generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To put it differently, even though article 1(1) of the CISG says that it
                        applies only “to contracts of sale of goods”, the Respondent
                        argues that clause 25 of the Contract should be interpreted as a choice by
                        the parties to apply the substantive rules of the CISG even to a contract
                        other than a contract of sale, i.e. a distribution agreement,
                        notwithstanding the rules of application found in the CISG.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There remains however that the clause 25 also states that the Contract is
                        governed by the CISG “<b><em><u>and where not applicable
                            </u></em></b><em>by Italian law</em>” so we do
                        have to decide when the CISG is applicable and when it is not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Respondent suggested that we should not look at the rules on
                        applicability found in the CISG to decide when the CISG applies. The
                        Respondent did not however explain fully what the criteria should be to
                        decide when the CISG does not apply and Italian law applies. In one example,
                        the Respondent suggested that the rules governing the termination of
                        contract found in the CISG “sit too awkwardly with a contract of the
                        kind like the Distribution Agreement”.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Awkwardness does not seem to be a reliable or workable criterion to decide
                        when the CISG does or does not apply, and the Tribunal does not believe that
                        this was what the parties had in mind when they agreed to clause 25.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In fact, at the opening of the hearing the Respondent contended that
                        articles 7, 8, 74 to 78 of the CISG applied but did not explain why they
                        applied and all the other articles of the CISG did not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Respondent’s Opening Submissions on the Vienna Convention dated 9
                        May 2011 at paragraph 17]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal also notes that beside saying that these particular articles
                        apply, counsel for the Respondent limited their argument to a few general
                        paragraphs in their Opening Submissions on the CISG and did not explain the
                        effect of article 8, 74 to 78 on the facts in dispute. In fact the
                        Respondent argued that “Italian principles of damages law are
                        substantially identical to the principles of damages law embodied in article
                        74 and 77 of the [CISG]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Paragraph 18 of the Respondent’s Opening Submissions on The Vienna
                        Convention dated 9 May 2011]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It therefore seems that the Respondent is of the view that these
                        particular articles made no different on damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only point that the Respondent seems to want to take from the CISG is
                        the fact that according to some authors and decisions, article 7 of the CISG
                        does not contain as liberal a concept of good faith as Italian law
                        does.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore it seems to be the position of the Respondent that articles 8
                        and 74 to 78 of the CISG apply but that most of them are identical to
                        Italian law, but article 7 of the CISG also applies and it enforces a much
                        more limited concept of good faith than the one found in Italian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to explain why all the
                        other provisions of the CISG either do not apply or make no difference,
                        except for that one provision of the CISG, article 7, and that provision
                        alone. This selective approach looks like an exercise in cherry picking. No
                        clear explanation was given by the Respondent for when the CISG applies and
                        when it does not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the hearing on 11 May 2011, the Tribunal decided that, as a matter of
                        contractual interpretation, the correct interpretation of clause 25 of the
                        Contract was that the parties had intended the CISG to apply to the extend
                        that the CISG is applicable according to its own rules on applicability, and
                        if it did not apply in part or in whole, then Italian law applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Tribunal then went on, in the next 31
                    paragraphs of the Award, to set out the reason as to why the decision was made
                    that the CISG was not applicable; in the Tribunal’s opinion the Agreement
                    did not contain a contract of sale but was a mere framework
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Accordingly, the Tribunal did, pursuant to
                    Article 17 of the ICC Rules, <em>respect</em> the choice of

                    applied to the dispute, and the Tribunal did apply the chosen rules of law to
                    the dispute. The real point of dispute was that Quarella considered that the
                    Tribunal applied the chosen law wrongly. That dispute was not one that engaged
                    Article 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law. Accordingly, I declined to set aside the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Quarella’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Quarella’s arguments in support of this
                    ground were scant and lacking in substance. It began by setting out the text of
                    Article 34(2)(a)(iii). Following that, Quarella cited a passage from an article
                    entitled <em>Getting to the Law Applicable to the Merits in
                        International Arbitration and the Consequences of Getting It
                        Wrong</em> by Linda Silberman and Franco Ferrari (“the
                    Ferrari/Silberman article”), which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We think that the arbitrators have in fact “exceeded their
                        powers” or gone beyond the “scope of submission to
                        arbitration” where an express choice of law has been included by the
                        parties to govern the merits of their dispute and the arbitrators apply
                        another law or fail to apply the law chosen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Quarella acknowledged that the passage was
                    written in the context of Article V(1)(c) of the New York Convention, but
                    asserted that the words used in Article V(1)(c) are <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with the words in Article
                    34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. Accordingly, it submitted, the Tribunal, in
                    applying Italian law (which was not the law expressly chosen by the parties) had
                    gone beyond the scope of submission to arbitration. The entire written
                    submission on this argument was made up of four short and underdeveloped
                    paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This was not a particularly novel argument. In
                        <em>The Arbitrators’ Duty to Respect the Parties’
                        Choice of Law in Commercial Arbitration</em>, 79 St. John's L. Rev.
                    59, Cindy Buys states (at 69-72):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The contractual nature of arbitration serves to distinguish it from
                        litigation. Unlike judges, who are appointed or elected by law, arbitrators
                        are appointed by the private agreement of the parties, and their allegiance
                        should be to seeing that the terms of that private agreement are carried
                        out. The arbitrator's duty to respect the wishes of the parties as expressed
                        in their written agreement extends to respect for the parties' choice of law
                        in a commercial transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Absent overriding public policy considerations, reviewing courts also
                        should respect party autonomy pursuant to two well-established doctrines.
                        First, respecting party autonomy in arbitration furthers the federal policy
                        in favor of arbitration as reflected in the FAA. As stated above, the FAA
                        creates the right to have the arbitration proceed in accordance with the
                        parties' wishes. If the parties know that courts will uphold arbitration
                        awards that are made in accordance with the parties' wishes, the parties
                        will be even more likely to resort to arbitration as an alternative means of
                        dispute resolution. Routine respect for the parties' agreement makes the
                        process more certain and predictable, thus allowing business persons to
                        better plan their business and legal dealings and relationships.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, respecting the agreement of the parties is consistent with the
                        general policy favoring freedom of contract. When courts are deciding
                        disputes arising out of contractual relationships, the intent of the parties
                        is generally controlling. Likewise, an arbitral tribunal is bound to
                        effectuate the intent of the parties. <em>These same
                            principles should be applied to require enforcement of contractual
                            provisions reflecting the choice of law made by the parties. Thus, if a
                            court is reviewing an arbitral award where the arbitrators have failed
                            to respect the parties' choice of law, the court should vacate that
                            award because the arbitrators have exceeded their
                        powers.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     And in a footnote to the last sentence of the
                    excerpt, Buys states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The FAA provides that one of the grounds for vacation of an arbitral award
                        is “[w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers.” 9 U.S.C.
                            § 10(a)(4). Despite this language, at least one
                        scholar, Thomas Carbonneau, suggested that arbitrators have certain inherent
                        authority implied by their designation as arbitrators to manage and conduct
                        the proceedings and that this authority may include the power to overrule
                        the parties' choice of law in the “best interests of the
                        process.” See Thomas E. Carbonneau, The Ballad of Transborder
                        Arbitration, 56 Miami L. Rev. 773, 814, 820-21 (2002). He argued that in
                        choosing arbitration, the parties bargained for a “workable
                        process” in exchange for placing “enormous authority and trust
                        in the arbitrator.” Id. at 815. While it is true that arbitrators are
                        vested with certain inherent authority to manage the arbitral process, this
                        author believes that the arbitrators' inherent authority is limited to
                        matters that the parties have not expressly agreed upon, i.e., to fill in
                        gaps. Where the parties have expressly bargained for and agreed upon a
                        contractual term, the arbitrator lacks the power to <em>overrule</em> the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scelta’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Scelta argued that, in reality, what Quarella
                    was saying was that the Tribunal made the wrong decision and fell into error.
                    Scelta also argued that the Tribunal did not decide matters beyond its ambit of
                    reference; the Tribunal was <em>specifically asked</em> by
                    Quarella to decide on the applicability of the CISG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Scelta also cited two passages from <em>Born</em>, the first of which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... a considerable measure of judicial deference is accorded the
                        arbitrators’ interpretation of the scope of their mandate under the
                        parties’ submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Courts are particularly unwilling to accept arguments
                            that, by ignoring or refusing to give effect to the terms of the
                            parties’ underlying contract, the tribunal exceeded its authority.
                            It is typically held that such arguments amount to an effort to obtain
                            judicial review of the merits of the tribunal’s decision; as such,
                            these efforts do not constitute an excess of authority and instead, at
                            most, involve an allegedly incorrect decision in the exercise of such
                            authority.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The paragraph which followed (which was not
                    cited) read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was reflected in a recent decision in <em>Lesotho
                            Highlands Development Authority v. Impregilo </em><em>SpA</em>, where the House of Lords rejected the argument
                        that an arbitral tribunal’s application of English law, rather than
                        the terms of the parties’ contract, constituted an excess of authority
                        which permitted annulment of its award under s 68 of the Act. Lord Steyn
                        declared that “nowhere in s 68 is there any hint that a failure by
                        the tribunal to arrive at the ‘correct decision’ could afford a
                        ground for challenge under s 68.” While this view is both clearly
                        correct and representative of most decisions, national courts are
                        nonetheless sometimes persuaded – wrongly – to treat arguable
                        errors of law as an excess of authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The second passage cited by Scelta
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Neither the New York Convention nor most developed
                            arbitration statutes expressly permit non-recognition of an arbitral
                            award because the arbitrators erred in their choice-of-law
                            analysis.</em> Rather, as noted above, and in the absence of a
                        choice of law agreement, the arbitrators’ choice-of-law decisions are
                        subsumed within their rulings on the merits of the parties’ dispute,
                        and thus subject to the general presumption in favour of recognition under
                        the Convention and most developed arbitration legislation. <em>Thus, except where statutory protections or public policy
                            issues are involved, judicial review of the arbitrators’
                            choice-of-law decisions concerning the substantive law applicable to the
                            merits of the parties’ dispute is usually minimal in developed
                            national courts, both in common law and civil law

                    the Court of Appeal said, in discussing Article 34(2)(a)(iii) (at [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The law on the jurisdiction of an arbitral
                            tribunal is well established. Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law
                            merely reflects the basic principle that an arbitral tribunal has no
                            jurisdiction to decide any issue not referred to it for determination by
                            the parties.</em> In relation to this matter, we note Lord
                        Halsbury's observations in <em>London and North Western and
                            Great Western Joint Railway Companies v J H Billington,
                            Limited</em> [1899] AC 79, where he noted, at 81, as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I do not think any lawyer could reasonably contend that, when parties
                            are referring differences to arbitration, under whatever authority that
                            reference is made, you could for the first time introduce a new
                            difference after the order of arbitration was made. Therefore, upon that
                            question I certainly do give a very strong opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>CRW Joint Operation v PT
                        Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR 305
                        (“<em>Persero</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    set out the law relating to Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law (at
                    [30]-[33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>PT Asuransi </em><em>Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1
                        SLR(R) 597, this court held (at [44]) that the court had to adopt a
                        two-stage enquiry in assessing whether an arbitral award ought to be set
                        aside under Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. Specifically, it had to
                        determine:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    first, what matters were within the scope of
                                submission to the arbitral tribunal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    second, whether the arbitral award involved
                                such matters, or whether it involved "a new difference ... outside
                                the scope of the submission to arbitration and accordingly ...
                                irrelevant to the issues requiring determination" [emphasis in
                                original] (at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is useful, at this juncture, to set out some of the legal principles
                        underlying the application of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. First, Art
                        34(2)(a)(iii) is not concerned with the situation where an arbitral tribunal
                        did not have jurisdiction to deal with the dispute which it purported to
                        determine. <em>Rather, it applies where the arbitral tribunal
                            improperly decided matters that had not been submitted to it or failed
                            to decide matters that had been submitted to it.</em> In other
                        words, Art 34(2)(a)(iii) addresses the situation where the arbitral tribunal
                        exceeded (or failed to exercise) the authority that the parties granted to
                        it (see Gary B Born, <em>International Commercial
                            Arbitration</em> (Wolters Kluwer, 2009) at vol 2, pp 2606-2607 and
                        2798-2799). This ground for setting aside an arbitral award covers only an
                        arbitral tribunal's substantive jurisdiction and does not extend to
                        procedural matters (see Robert Merkin &amp; Johanna Hjalmarsson, <em>Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated</em>
                        (Informa, 2009) ("Singapore Arbitration Legislation") at p 117).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, it must be noted that a failure by an arbitral
                        tribunal to deal with every issue referred to it will not ordinarily render
                        its arbitral award liable to be set aside. The crucial question in every
                        case is whether there has been real or actual prejudice to either (or both)
                        of the parties to the dispute. In this regard, the following passage in
                        Redfern and Hunter ([27] supra at para 10.40) correctly summarises the
                        position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The significance of the issues that were not dealt with has to be
                            considered in relation to the award as a whole. For example, it is not
                            difficult to envisage a situation in which the issues that were
                            overlooked were of such importance that, if they had been dealt with,
                            the whole balance of the award would have been altered and its effect
                            would have been different. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Third, it is trite that mere errors of law or even fact
                            are not sufficient to warrant setting aside an arbitral award under Art
                            34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law</em> (see <em>Sui
                            Southern Gas Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd</em>
                        [2010] 3 SLR 1 at [19]-[22]). In the House of Lords decision of <em>Lesotho Highlands Development Authority v Impregilo
                            </em><em>SpA</em> [2006] 1 AC 221, which
                        concerned an application to set aside an arbitral award on the ground of the
                        arbitral tribunal's "exceeding its powers" (see s 68(2)(b) of the
                        Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) ("the UK Arbitration Act")), Lord Steyn
                        made clear (at [24]-[25]) the vital distinction between the erroneous
                        exercise by an arbitral tribunal of an available power vested in it (which
                        would amount to no more than a mere error of law) and the purported exercise
                        by the arbitral tribunal of a power which it did not possess. Only in the
                        latter situation, his Lordship stated, would an arbitral award be liable to
                        be set aside under s 68(2)(b) of the UK Arbitration Act on the ground that
                        the arbitral tribunal had exceeded its powers. In a similar vein, Art
                        34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law applies where an arbitral tribunal exceeds
                        its authority by deciding matters beyond its ambit of reference or fails to
                        exercise the authority conferred on it by failing to decide the matters
                        submitted to it, which in turn prejudices either or both of the parties to
                        the dispute (see above at [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The first and third principles are what I
                    applied to this case. With regard to the first principle, on the facts before
                    me, this was not a case where the arbitral tribunal improperly decided matters
                    that had not been submitted to it or failed to decide matters that had been
                    submitted to it. The issue of the applicable law was submitted to the Tribunal;
                    the Award addressed this explicitly (at [48] of the Award). The Tribunal did
                    decide the matters that were submitted to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     With regard to the third principle, besides
                    examining the guidance set out by the Court of Appeal in the excerpts above,
                    Quarella would not have had to venture too far to find literature that would
                    have indicated that the prospects of it succeeding in the setting aside
                    application on this ground were dim. A recently published monograph by Chan Leng
                    Sun, <em>Singapore Law on Arbitral Awards</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2011) states (at para 6.127):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An issue that is within the scope of submission to arbitration does not go
                        outside the scope simply because the arbitral tribunal comes to a wrong
                        conclusion on it. Unless the award contained decisions beyond the scope of
                        the arbitration agreement, an error in interpreting the contract does not
                        permit setting aside under Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law 1985.
                            <em>Neither would an argument that the tribunal applied
                            the wrong governing law constitute a ground for setting aside an
                            award.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Quarella’s attempt to set aside the
                    Award under 34(2)(a)(iii) was based entirely on a disagreement with the
                    interpretation the Tribunal took regarding the choice of law clause. The dispute
                    was not one that engaged Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Whilst it is not strictly necessary for me to
                    do so, I would like to explain why the Ferrari/Silberman article did not assist
                    Quarella.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     From a reading of the whole article, it is
                    apparent that the article was making a proposal, as was stated in the heading to
                    the concluding section. The article was not stating the current legal position.
                    It was also conceded by the authors that the suggested position was based less
                    on case law than on policy or views from commentators. Further, the article
                    refers to the <em>deliberate disregard or the ignoring by the
                        arbitrator</em> of the choice of law clause agreed on by the parties.
                    It is even made clear on more than one occasion that cases of that nature
                        <em>should be distinguished</em> from situations where
                    the arbitrators applied the applicable law incorrectly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It would appear that the arguments in the
                    Ferrari/Silberman article were similar to those put forward earlier under s
                    34(2)(a)(iv), albeit under a different subsection of the same Article in the
                    Model Law. In response to the arguments, I found that the Tribunal here did not
                    deliberately disregard or ignore or overrule the parties’ choice of law
                    clause. It did not fail to honour (or in the words of Buys, fail to respect) the
                    choice of law clause set out by the parties. Accordingly, Quarella failed to
                    convince me that I should set aside the Award pursuant to Article
                    34(2)(a)(iii).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     For completeness, Quarella, having failed to
                    convince me to set aside the Award, also failed to convince me that the Costs
                    Award should be set aside.</p>
