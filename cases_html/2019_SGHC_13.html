</div> After Mr Vaz assumed the presidency of SSA, he decided that SSA should take over from SRA the operation and management of all ranges at the NSC, and that in exchange, SRA would have one range for its exclusive use. So the licence was superseded by another contract between them titled “Proprietary Range Agreement” and executed in November 2014 (“the Agreement”).

At the time the Agreement was signed, the location known as Range X was not an empty plot of land. There was already a disused and dilapidated shooting range there. Instead of tearing down the existing structure and building a new one in its place, SRA’s plan for the construction of the Club Range was to refurbish the existing range.

</div> Mr Chung’s plan had two phases. The first phase would involve replacing the dilapidated pre-existing structures, including overhead steel trusses and old target structures. It would also involve minor works such as the installation of a lightning protection system. The second phase would involve the construction of a metal roof over a resting area. SRA’s understanding was that only the second phase needed approval from the relevant authorities, including building plan approval from the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore (“BCA”) and planning approval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”).

SSA in turn counterclaimed damages in the amount of the cost of demolishing the Club Range.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ pleaded cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 SRA’s case has two main parts. First, it claims that the circular resolution is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and should be declared null and void on a number of grounds. These include the fact that SSA has no power under its constitution to suspend the privileges of SRA, the fact that the resolution was passed in breach of the proper procedure for passing a resolution under SSA’s constitution, and the fact that SRA was not given a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the allegations made in the resolution against SRA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Secondly, SRA claims that Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen conspired to injure SRA. SRA asserts that they did so by working together as members of the SSA council to procure the passing of an <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> resolution purporting to suspend the privileges of SRA at the NSC. SRA claims damages for loss arising from its investigation into and response to this alleged conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendants deny that the circular resolution is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and that Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen were involved in any conspiracy to injure SRA. They also mount a counterclaim, alleging that SRA breached its obligation under cl 10 of the Agreement by refusing to indemnify SSA for costs incurred in engaging Pikasa to demolish the Club Range. SSA claims that it was acting in compliance with an order issued by BCA when it demolished the Club Range, and that SRA, having built the range, is responsible under cl 10 for the cost of demolition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 SRA resists SSA’s counterclaim on the basis that SSA has not suffered any loss for which SRA is liable to indemnify SSA under cl 10. SRA contends that the cost of demolition resulted from SSA’s breach of an implied term in the Agreement, which means that SSA cannot claim an indemnity for that loss. SRA also submits that in any event, the Agreement should be set aside on the ground of unilateral mistake and misrepresentation, with the effect that cl 10 does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having regard to the evidence, the law and the parties’ cases, I consider that there are three main issues to be determined:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, is the circular resolution of 16 December 2015 <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, are Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen liable to SRA in the tort of conspiracy?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, is SRA liable under cl 10 of the Agreement to pay SSA the cost of demolishing the Club Range?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I shall consider these questions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Validity of the circular resolution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I accept SRA’s case that the circular resolution is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. This is for three independent reasons. First, under SSA’s constitution, the SSA council has no power to suspend the privileges of a member of SSA. Secondly, SSA’s constitution also does not empower the SSA Council to make decisions by circular resolution. Finally, the circular resolution was in any event passed without SRA being given a chance to be heard, and is therefore void for being in breach of natural justice. I turn now to explain each of these reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Power of suspension</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In a leading English treatise on unincorporated associations, it is stated that “[a]ny rule relating to discipline, including expulsion, suspension, or any other penalty, should be framed in plain and unambiguous language”: Nicholas Stewart QC et al, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Unincorporated Associations</span> (Oxford University Press, 2011) at para 6.06. This is only to be expected because the consequences of disciplinary action, especially in the form of expulsion or suspension, can be severe and drastic, and it is only fair that members of the association have the assurance that the power to impose such consequences are clearly defined and limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The starting point therefore is to examine SSA’s constitution for provisions on the suspension of members’ privileges. As SRA correctly points out, none of the 18 articles in the constitution concern disciplinary action, let alone provide for a power of suspension (with one exception, which relates to non-payment of membership fees).

Art 6.4 refers to suspension of a member’s privileges only on the ground that the member falls into arrears with its subscription or other dues. That ground is not engaged in this case. Art 8.1 merely entrusts the council with the administration and management of SSA. Clearly, this must be performed in accordance with the constitution, and cannot be read as allowing the council to create powers for itself which the constitution does not confer. Art 16.1 also makes no express reference to any power of suspension. In fact, a provision very similar to art 16.1 was considered in <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng v Chu Sheng Temple</span> [2015] SGHC 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng</span>”), where it was held at [52] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That provision appears to be primarily geared to allow the management committee to have facilitative powers for the continued running and operation of the Defendant. The expulsion of a member is a drastic and serious action; it cannot be easily founded on a broad provision of this nature. It is also noteworthy that the titled of Article XIII is “Interpretation”; while not determinative, that description further reinforces the conclusion that the article is merely facilitated and does not give any power to expel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree fully with the foregoing passage, and consider that what it says about expulsion applies equally to suspension. After all, both are penal in nature and both involve deprivation of the privileges of membership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This leaves the argument from the implication of terms to be considered. In <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng</span>, the court declined to imply a power of expulsion, following the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1267 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Foo Jong </span><span class="font-italic">Peng</span>, the Court of Appeal held that a term conferring a power on the management committee of a club to remove office bearers could not be implied. Such a term failed the “business efficacy” test as it was not necessary for the effective management of the club. It also failed the “officious bystander” test as such a power could not be said to be so obvious that members of the club would have considered that it would go without saying that the management committee itself should be free to remove an office bearer. In the present case, I would follow the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng </span>and similarly hold that it is neither necessary to imply a power of suspension for the effective management of SSA nor is the power of suspension so obvious that members of SSA would consider that it goes without saying that the SSA council should have the power to suspend members of SSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Accordingly, the circular resolution is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> because the SSA council was not authorised under SSA’s constitution to suspend the privileges of SRA at the NSC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Power to pass circular resolutions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also consider that the constitution does not empower the SSA council to make decisions by way of circular resolution. The starting point, again, must be SSA’s constitution. The relevant provision are arts 8.6, 8.8, 8.9 and 8.11, which provide:

</div> SSA relies again on arts 8.1 and 16.1, making the same argument as it does in support of SSA’s power to suspend its members, that those provisions give the SSA council unrestricted powers to address any issue or matter arising out of any point not expressly provided for in SSA’s constitution. According to the defendants, this entails that the council may determine and use other means of passing a resolution, including circular resolutions of the kind used in this case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I have no hesitation in rejecting SSA’s argument. On the one hand, I accept that <span class="font-italic">on its face</span>, art 8.6 appears only to regulate how resolutions are to be passed at meetings and does not specify that all resolutions must be passed at meetings. On the other hand, the overall tenor of the provisions quoted at [43] above indicates that decisions of the SSA council are to be made in meetings. Art 8.8 requires the council to meet at least once every quarter, and allows additional council meetings to be convened at short notice. Art 8.9 emphasises the importance of attendance at council meetings. Art 8.11 prescribes the quorum for council meetings and makes provision for how meetings may proceed if the attendance is below quorum. Art 8.6 makes rather prescriptive provisions for how resolutions are to be passed at meetings (by <span class="font-italic">secret</span> ballot unless there is unanimous agreement for voting to be done by show of hand) while no provision is made for how resolutions may be passed without a meeting. These provisions taken together, including the requirement for secret ballot at council meetings, are inconsistent with the notion that the SSA council could, in the absence of specific provisions empowering it to do so, make decisions by circular resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I do not accept that art 16.1, which has become SSA’s last refuge in this series of arguments, empowers the council to make decisions by circular resolution. Art 16.1 is entitled “Interpretation” and empowers the council to use its discretion on “any question or matter arising out of any point which is not expressly provided for in this Constitution”. The purpose of art 16.1 is to allow the council to use its discretion on matters <span class="font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">expressly provided </span>for in the constitution. Art 16.1 cannot be read to give the SSA council <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> to create new powers for itself or create new modes of exercising its powers, especially when these matters (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> how council resolutions are passed) have already been expressly provided for in the constitution. More importantly, art 16.1 makes clear that the invocation of art 16.1 involves a “decision of the Council”. SSA is not able to point to any previous resolution of the SSA council deciding that the council could henceforth make decisions by circular resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The defendants’ last argument here is that the court should imply a term in SSA’s constitution that enables SSA to pass circular resolutions.

</div> The defendants say firstly that there is a “gap” because the council meets only once every two to three months, and so a term must be implied to allow the council a means of deciding matters between each meeting, such as by way of circular resolution.

</div> Secondly, the defendants say that although allowing circular resolutions pose an alleged risk to board governance standards, circular resolutions are not illegal, and good governance is preserved by the fact that physical council meetings would still take place regularly.

I do not accept that there is a gap in the constitution in the sense that the drafters failed to address their minds to how the council would make decisions between regular meetings. That is because while art 8.8 requires a council meeting to be held at least once every quarter, it also empowers the president of SSA to call a council meeting “at any time”, as long as he gives five days’ notice. Since there are already express provisions for the making of urgent decisions in between regular meetings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> by convening additional meetings at short notice) there is no gap to be filled by SSA’s proposed implied term. Even if there were a gap, the proposed implied term would not satisfy the “business efficacy” test because the ability of the president of SSA to call a council meeting at any time at short notice renders it unnecessary, for the effective operation of SSA, to imply a term enabling the SSA council to pass circular resolutions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, the proposed term also fails the “officious bystander” test as I do not accept that an obvious term to be implied to fill that gap would be a term empowering the council to make circular resolutions.

</div> Instead, the circular resolution was merely a preliminary measure for gauging the level of support for SRA’s suspension. If there were sufficient support, then SSA would proceed to convene a BOI to investigate SRA’s failures to comply with the council’s resolutions, and to hear SRA’s reasons for those failures. Only after that would the council make a decision to suspend SRA’s privileges at the NSC. SRA was therefore afforded an opportunity to be heard at the hearing of the BOI held on 16 March 2016.

First, the terms of the circular resolution clearly indicate otherwise. The council, it says, “resolves by Circular Resolution, to suspend the privileges of [SRA]”. And the resolution gives a specific date for the suspension to take effect, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> 1 January 2016. Nothing is mentioned in the resolution about any need to convene a BOI. It does not say that the suspension would come into effect after a BOI has made its finding, or after formal adoption of a decision to suspend in a subsequently convened council meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, there is no reference to a BOI hearing in any of the emails that preceded the passing of the circular resolution. Nor do these emails bear out SSA’s explanation that the circular resolution was merely some sort of straw poll to gauge the level of support for a suspension within the SSA council before the formal process for suspension is initiated. In particular, I note that there was no mention by SSA of a BOI until after SSA received the letter dated 16 December 2015 from SRA’s lawyers objecting to the circulation (see [21] above) and complaining that, among other things, SSA had failed to respect SRA’s right to due process.

He would have expelled SRA if he could, but he did not think it would sit well with some in the SSA council. He therefore opted for a less drastic course. In fact, he had been thinking of expelling SRA since at least 1 October 2015, as an email he sent that day shows.

</div>
</div>
</div> Secondly, the email of 11 December 2015 shows that he was eager to impose the suspension. He wanted the suspension to take effect on 1 January 2016. Thirdly, given this tight timetable, there was simply no time to convene any BOI to conduct any hearing on or investigation into SRA’s alleged breaches during the short two weeks between the passing of the circular resolution and the date it was supposed to take effect. From this, the inference is clear that the BOI hearings – all of which were conducted after January 2016 – were an empty formality intended only to create the impression that SRA was given some kind of due process when in fact suspension was but a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There are two further points I should deal with for completeness. First, I consider that the reference in the 11 December 2015 email to having the circular resolution ratified at a council meeting before Christmas does not detract from the notion that the effective instrument for bringing about the suspension of SRA’s privileges was the circular resolution. The email does not speak of passing a fresh resolution or a definitive resolution at the council meeting to be held before Christmas. Instead, the purpose of the meeting was to ratify <span class="font-italic">the circular resolution</span>, thus confirming that the circular resolution was intended to be the operative instrument. If anything, the intended timing of the council meeting (before Christmas) further confirms that the convening of the BOI was never on the cards, so to speak, until after SSA received SRA’s lawyers’ letter of 16 December 2015. Second, although Mr Yap remarked in cross-examination that he and Mr Vaz had “discussed a little” the convening of a BOI when they met on 30 November 2015,

</div> I did not give much weight to this remark. This point was not mentioned in Mr Yap’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, not corroborated by any of the other defendants and not borne out by any documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I therefore find that SSA intended the circular resolution to be the effective instrument for bringing about the suspension of SRA’s privileges at the NSC, and that there was never any intention on the part of SSA to convene a BOI until after SRA got wind of the circular resolution and got its lawyers to write to SSA protesting the circular resolution. Accordingly, in so far as the circular resolution purported to suspend SRA’s privileges at the NSC, it must be invalidated because SRA was not given a fair hearing before the circular resolution was passed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mootness of the challenge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It remains for me to deal with SSA’s submissions that SRA’s challenge against the validity of the circular resolution is moot. SSA’s first submission in this regard is built on the fact that SRA is no longer a member of SSA. I do not see how this assists SSA’s case. When this suit was commenced, SRA was still a member of SSA. The purported expulsion of SRA by SSA six months after the commencement of this suit cannot deprive this court of the jurisdiction to rule on a dispute which was clearly extant and relevant at the time the suit was brought. I also note that, up till today, SRA has not accepted the legality of its expulsion and continues to contest it. Although SSA makes the point that no formal legal proceedings have been brought by SRA to contest the expulsion, I note that the time limit for bringing such legal action has not expired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 SSA’s second submission is that SRA never had privileges to use the NSC under SSA’s constitution.

</div> Instead, any such privilege stemmed solely from the Agreement. I reject this submission. As SRA correctly highlights, the Agreement dealt only with the Club Range.

</div>
</div> The Agreement does not spell out any other rights or privileges SRA enjoys at the NSC. Those other rights or privileges pre-date and are independent of the Agreement. Hence, they must arise as a result of SRA’s relationship with SSA as a member of the latter. Moreover, not even Mr Vaz himself believed that he was acting in vain in proposing the circular resolution. As president of SSA, he believed that SRA had been accorded privileges at the NSC as a result of its membership of the SSA, and SSA was therefore entitled to suspend those privileges as a matter of SSA’s internal discipline. Hence, SSA’s case on the true source of SRA’s privileges at the NSC is incorrect in law and contrary to the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 A final point to be addressed here relates to two motions passed respectively at the SSA council meeting on 13 February 2016

</div> The motion of 13 February 2016 provided for the suspension of SRA “as a Member Club of SSA” without indicating the specific terms of suspension. It was adopted with three votes in favour, zero votes against and two abstentions. The three votes in favour were cast by Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen. The motion of 9 April 2016 provided for the suspension of SRA “as a Member Club of SSA with no privileges on the use of all ranges and armouries in NSC”. It was adopted with three votes in favour, zero votes against and zero abstentions. The only voting members of the SSA council present at this meeting were Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen, and all three voted in favour of the motion. Did the passing of these two motions cure the irregularities identified in respect of the circular resolution? In my judgment, the answer is “no”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The fact remains that SSA has no power under its constitution to suspend a member or a member’s privileges, as I have concluded at [42] above. The fact also remains that at the time the circular resolution was passed, SRA had not been given a fair hearing on the cause for suspending its privileges, as I have concluded at [59] above. In fact, the motion of 13 February 2016 was also passed without the BOI having heard from SRA:

</div> see [23]–[25] above. Although the motion of 9 April 2016 was passed after the BOI held its second hearing, during which SRA was invited to make representations but declined for reasons outlined at [26] above, I am not persuaded that this would have cured any concerns over breach of natural justice, given my finding at [57] above that the BOI was an empty formality intended only to create the impression that SRA was given some kind of due process when in fact suspension was but a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For all the reasons above, I hold that the circular resolution was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and invalid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Conspiracy to injure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn now to SRA’s claim in conspiracy.

In the present case, the SSA council’s passing of an <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> resolution, in breach of SSA’s constitution, to suspend SRA’s privileges at the NSC, is actionable by SRA.

</div> At that time, there were only two positive votes, namely, those of Mr Vaz and Mr Chen. Apart from Mr Yap who had not voted and SRA’s Mr Loo who had objected, the other council members had either abstained or not responded. The only explanation for this is that there was already an understanding between Mr Vaz and Mr Yap that the latter would support the resolution. Mr Yap conceded this during cross-examination:

Pursuant to that agreement, the Individual Defendants promoted and voted in favour of the circular resolution. On another view, the Individual Defendants had agreed on or before 30 November 2015 to work towards suspension of SRA and, pursuant to that agreement, the Individual Defendants procured the ratification of the five resolutions subsequently used to justify the passing of the circular resolution, followed by subsequent acts of the Individual Defendants in drafting, promoting and voting for the circular resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 On either view, I am satisfied that there was an agreement among the Individual Defendants to procure the suspension of SRA, and that they acted in furtherance of this agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Individual Defendants intended to cause damage to SRA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The next question is whether the Individual Defendants acted with the requisite intention. Given my finding that the present case involves unlawful means conspiracy, the relevant test is whether the Individual Defendants had the <span class="font-italic">intention</span> to injure SRA. It is not necessary, in cases of unlawful means conspiracy, to prove that the alleged conspirators acted with the predominant purpose of injuring the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To establish the requisite intention for unlawful means conspiracy, the claimant must show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted or directed at him. It is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be a likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct. Injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself. As Lord Hoffmann observed in <span class="font-italic">OBG</span> at [62] (which is cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span> at [104]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is necessary to distinguish between ends, means and consequences.

The final sentence in the passage quoted above, in attempting to explain that the measures were not targeted at the individual SRA members, merely serves to confirm that the measures were targeted at SRA as an organisation. During cross-examination, Mr Vaz tried to put a gloss on this by maintaining that he was targeting only the SRA council, and not SRA.

</div> This attempt by Mr Vaz to draw a distinction between SRA and its council is artificial and unsustainable. It ignores the fact that the SRA council is not only an integral part of SRA, but also the governing body of SRA. Actions which harm and impede the SRA council would necessarily harm and impede SRA.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 My first comment is that the defendants’ explanation that the circular resolution’s purpose was to get SRA to comply with certain SSA council resolutions does not ring true. The explanation is not borne out by the terms of the circular resolution, which contains no provision for the suspension to be lifted or stayed if SRA were to comply with the said SSA council resolutions. My second comment is that, as this case concerns unlawful means conspiracy, such an explanation, even if true, would not assist the Individual Defendants. This is because even if I accept that the ends which the Individual Defendants hoped to attain through SRA’s suspension is the promotion and defence of SSA’s interests, the injury which would be caused to SRA by the proposed suspension would nonetheless constitute the means of attaining those ends. That, according to the principles discussed at [78] above, would be sufficient to satisfy the element of intention to injure in unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In any event, for completeness, I note that SRA proffers a different explanation for the Individual Defendants’ motive behind the conspiracy. SRA submits that Mr Vaz bears a longstanding grudge against SRA which had originated in 2012. SRA alleges that in 2012, Mr Vaz was embroiled in a power struggle with Mr Laurence Wee, the then chairman of SRA, for the presidency of SSA. When Mr Wee was elected to that office in September 2012, Mr Vaz publicly stated his intention to contest the result in the courts. Mr Wee later stepped down, and Mr Vaz was elected President of SSA. SRA alleges that Mr Vaz’s “bad blood” with SRA’s leadership continued into Mr Eng’s chairmanship of SRA. Mr Vaz also made direct reference to this in his email dated 16 December 2015 proposing the circular resolution, claiming that “since the time of SRA President Laurence Wee, SRA has consistently acted against SSA’s mission to open the NSC facilities to all Singaporeans”.

However, to appreciate more fully the context of this case, it seems to me relevant to note that there appears to be some support for SRA’s contention that Mr Vaz’s actions in this case may be explained in part by a longstanding animosity between him and SRA’s leadership. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether SRA suffered Damage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Finally, SRA needs to show that it has suffered damage. Damage in the tort of conspiracy is proved if the plaintiff is able to show that some pecuniary loss has been suffered by him; he need not prove precisely that loss, because damages are at large: <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> <span class="font-italic">Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 159 (“<span class="font-italic">JTrust</span>”) at [61] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Steven Chong JA. In this case, SRA pleaded that the conspiracy resulted in (a) loss arising from and related to the investigation and detection of the said conspiracy; and (b) loss arising from and related to the undertaking of steps to redress the said conspiracy. It argues that it has suffered pecuniary loss in that it incurred costs to investigate, respond to and unravel the conspiracy. In this regard, SRA relied on:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling v American Insurance Assurance Co Ltd </span>[2018] 5 SLR 549 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling</span>”), where Belinda Ang J held that costs of investigation can constitute a head of loss in a conspiracy claim so long as there is a causal link between the costs of investigating the conspiracy and the tort itself (at [14]); and<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>”), where Lee Seiu Kin J awarded damages for the costs of investigating confidential documents that had been removed pursuant to a conspiracy to injure the plaintiff on the basis that those costs “flowed from the conspiracy” (at [243]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The defendants submit that in the absence of other types of pecuniary loss over and above the costs of investigating, detecting and responding to the conspiracy, the court should not accept that the costs of investigating, detecting and responding to the conspiracy could, <span class="font-italic">by themselves</span>, satisfy the “damage” element of the tort of conspiracy. Were it otherwise, the defendants reason, the requirement of damage would be rendered otiose as a claimant would always be able to establish the “damage” element of the tort by claiming that it had incurred costs in investigating, detecting and responding to the conspiracy.

So, to the extent that the law in Singapore on this point was unclear at the time <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>was decided, the law has since been clarified by <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling </span>and <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>. In any event, <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>contains no statements which could be construed as casting doubt on the point. All that Woo J stated was that, on the facts, he did not need to decide the point (at [169]). I also reject the defendants’ suggestion that <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling </span>misread <span class="font-italic">R+V </span><span class="font-italic">Verscherung</span>. Although Gloster J made a finding of fact in <span class="font-italic">R+V </span><span class="font-italic">Verscherung</span> that the plaintiff suffered other pecuniary loss besides investigation costs, thus rendering merely <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> his comments on whether investigation costs, by themselves, constitute damage for the tort of conspiracy, Gloster J did not decline to express a view on the issue. On the contrary, Gloster J opined at [64] and [77]<span class="font-italic"> </span>as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 The reference, however, to the potential need to prove some other pecuniary loss in addition to the time spent remedying or mitigating the damage is perhaps difficult, with respect, to understand. Either the claim for wasted employee time amounts to recoverable loss or it does not. Why should it make a difference whether there is another clearly recoverable head of loss?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77 In my judgment, as a matter of principle, such head of loss (i.e. the cost of wasted staff time spent on the investigation and/or mitigation of the tort) is recoverable, notwithstanding that no additional expenditure “loss” or loss of revenue or profit can be shown. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">And it was [77] of <span class="font-italic">R+V </span><span class="font-italic">Verscherung </span>which was cited by Ang J at [14] of <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my judgment, the law in Singapore on this point is clearly laid down in <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling </span>and <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span> as well as in <span class="font-italic">Li Siu </span><span class="font-italic">Lun v Looi Kok Poh and another </span>[2015] 4 SLR 667.

The costs of that investigation, including legal fees and disbursements, are therefore recoverable. Accordingly, SRA succeeds in establishing the tort of conspiracy against the Individual Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quantum of damages </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I turn now to the quantum of damages to be awarded for the loss that SRA suffered as a result of this tort. SRA claims damages for the following heads of loss:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) legal fees and disbursements paid to SRA’s solicitors for the purpose of obtaining advice on and investigating the conspiracy, in the sum of $63,200; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) costs incurred in scheduling SRA council meetings in relation to the investigation of the conspiracy, in the sum of $16,180, the breakdown of which is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) $1,100 in respect of Mr Eng Fook Hoong;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) $3,080 in respect of Mr Simon Ng;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) $3,850 in respect of Mr Conrad Chung;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) $2,200 in respect of Mr Timothy Ng;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) $1,050 in respect of Mr Kevin Leong;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) $1,100 in respect of Mr Ong Eng Chong;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) $2,100 in respect of Mr Ricky Cheung; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) $1,700 in respect of four other council members; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ix) $500 in disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In my view, SRA is entitled to recover from the Individual Defendants the legal fees and disbursements that SRA paid to its solicitors for the purpose of seeking advice on and investigating and responding to the conspiracy.

That is because SRA did not suffer loss in this regard. These were losses suffered by SRA council members (not SRA), and SRA was not obliged to pay its council members for their efforts in relation to the investigation of the conspiracy, given that they were volunteers. Mr Eng accepted this during cross-examination, and as he put it, “When we act as volunteers, we don’t expect payment.”

</div> If any of the SRA council members involved had also been SRA’s salaried staff, I would have considered allowing recovery if it can be shown they were diverted from the usual activities for which they were being paid by SRA. The distinction is between (a) salary which SRA is obliged to pay its staff and which is “wasted” because the time of the staff so paid was diverted from SRA’s usual business towards responding to the conspiracy, and (b) honorariums or voluntary payments which SRA makes to council members to compensate their loss. The former is a pecuniary loss resulting directly from the conspiracy. The latter depends on SRA’s decision to be compassionate to its council members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As none of SRA members listed at [90(b)] above were SRA’s salaried staff, I do not allow SRA’s claim for costs of time incurred by its members in investigating and responding to the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 32A of the Charities Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, the Individual Defendants rely on s 32A of the Charities Act, which provides that the court may relieve a person on the governing board of a charity from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust if “it appears to the court” that “the person has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, he ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach.” Having regard to my finding that the Individual Defendants acted with intention to harm SRA and, in the process of doing so, not only acted in breach of the SSA constitution but also acted in breach of natural justice, I consider that this is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a case where those governing the relevant charity – in this case,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Individual Defendants in relation to SSA – had acted reasonably.

I do, however, hold that SSA cannot rely on cl 10 to be indemnified of the loss it sustained as a result of paying Pikasa to demolish the Club Range.

</div> He was not contradicted by SRA in this regard. It is also not disputed that the pre-existing structures had been constructed without regulatory approval. SRA argues that at the time it entered into the Agreement, it was mistaken that these structures at Range X had been built with approval. This mistake, SRA says, renders the Agreement void, with the effect that cl 10 is not binding on SRA. In my view, this argument is without merit because the mistake in question was not fundamental to the Agreement, and because SSA did not know that SRA made that mistake at the time the Agreement was entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The law on setting aside a contract at common law on the ground of a mistake on the part of one of the parties at the time the contract was entered into, otherwise called a unilateral mistake, is well settled. First, the claimant must have made a mistake in entering into the contract. Second, the mistake must have been fundamental or must relate to an essential term of the contract. Third, it must be shown that the other party had actual knowledge that the claimant was labouring under that mistake at the time the parties entered into the contract. In this regard, the court is entitled to find actual knowledge where the non-mistaken party is shown to have been wilfully blind to the mistaken party’s error.

</div> By this, SSA sought to imply that SRA, being the party responsible for the construction of the original structures at Range X, must have known that the structures had been erected without regulatory approval.

</div> and I accept his evidence. Even if the structures were originally built by SRA, this would have been done more than a decade before the Agreement was signed during which period there would have been significant changes in SRA’s personnel. Hence, the management of SRA at the time the Agreement was signed probably had no recollection or other information of what had occurred back then. Moreover, as SRA submits, the fact that they held this mistaken belief is supported by the fact that the pre-existing structures were large and highly visible. SSA and Sport Singapore representatives walked the grounds of the NSC on a regular basis, and no one ever said that the structures were illegal.

</div> So no reasonable suspicion to that effect was ever raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As regards the second requirement, I do not think that SRA’s mistake was a fundamental mistake or a mistake that relates to an essential term of the Agreement. What SSA promised SRA under the Agreement was that the latter would be entitled to construct a range on a piece of land designated in the Agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the land on which Range X stood. While the approval status of the pre-existing structures on Range X could affect the specific steps which SRA would take towards the construction of the Club Range, it would not have affected SRA’s decision whether to enter into the Agreement to construct the Club Range. Indeed, while Mr Chung stated that he was surprised when he first discovered from BG Lim in June 2015 that the pre-existing structures may not have been authorised,

All it proceeded to do was to further its efforts to build the Club Range in compliance with the regulatory requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Finally, I also do not think that SSA had actual knowledge of SRA’s mistake. SRA submits that the pre-existing structures were known by SSA to be illegal, and that SSA was attempting to whitewash this lapse through the regulatory approvals which SSA had expected SRA to obtain in the course of constructing the Club Range. In my view, given the loose structure which prevailed between SSA and member clubs at the time Range X was originally constructed, it is unlikely that SSA would have knowledge of what was done in relation to Range X at the time of its construction.

</div> SRA also refers to an email that Mr Vaz sent in January 2015 asking Mr Loo to remove a roof that SRA had prematurely constructed over a shed at Range X, and indicated that if that were done, the range’s gross floor area would remain intact and SRA could begin using the Club Range while approvals for the shed were being sought (thus implying that no further regulatory approvals were required before the Club Range could be used).

</div> Contrary to SRA’s submissions, however, I do not think that this evidence shows that SSA had known since the time the Agreement was signed that SRA was mistaken about the approval status of the pre-existing structures. Rather, the evidence is equally consistent with the view that, like SRA, SSA genuinely assumed that the pre-existing structures had been erected with approval.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For these reasons, I do not think that the Agreement is void by reason of a unilateral mistake on the part of SRA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I turn next to SRA’s argument from misrepresentation, beginning with the applicable principles. Once it is established that a contract has been induced by a misrepresentation, whether innocent, negligent or fraudulent, the party induced by the misrepresentation to enter into the contract may elect to rescind or affirm it: see s 1 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). It is also clear that a misrepresentation which would justify rescission of a contract may be used as a defence to an action brought by the representor against the representee: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015) at para 7-117. To establish an actionable misrepresentation, the claimant must show that (a) the defendant made a false representation; and (b) the claimant was induced by that representation to enter into the contract which he seeks to rescind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Applied to the present case, these principles require SRA to show that (a) SSA made a false representation that the pre-existing structures had been built with regulatory approval; and (b) SRA was induced by that false representation to enter into the Agreement. SRA argues that both elements are made out and, for this reason, that it is entitled to rescind the Agreement. And this right to rescind, SRA contends, would have afforded SRA a defence against SSA’s claim under cl 10. I reject this argument because I am not persuaded that SSA made the alleged misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 SRA contends that before it entered into the Agreement, SSA made an implied representation to SRA that the pre-existing structures on Range X had been built with approval. SRA relies on three facts in support of this contention: (a) the pre-existing structures looked like dilapidated structures from a previously operational range; (b) SSA did not tell SRA that the pre-existing structures needed regulatory approval; and (c) Mr Vaz told Mr Loo that the range was “already physically there”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I reject this submission. The evidence referred to is nothing more than evidence that the pre-existing structures existed – a fact that nobody ever doubted. Nothing was said by SSA about its approval status at the time the Agreement was entered into. That is not enough to constitute a misrepresentation, not even an implied one. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span> <span class="font-italic">Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>”), the law is always cautious not to ascribe significance to a party’s silence, which is “passive conduct” and “inherently lack[s] the definitive quality of an active statement” and is therefore “rarely considered sufficient to amount to a representation” (at [28] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Steven Chong JA). Of course, silence can acquire positive content, but only where there is a duty to speak on the part of the alleged representor, such that his failure would speak would, in the circumstances, lead a reasonable person to think that a certain representation has been made: <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span> at [28], citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Steven Chong JA. But I do not see how a reasonable person would infer from the mere existence of the pre-existing structures and from SSA’s silence that SSA meant to convey positively that the structures had been erected with approval. Equally plausible is the message that the structures are ripe for replacement or that they are of no value to SSA. In the circumstances, SRA in my judgment fails to satisfy the first requirement to establish a claim in misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 This being the case, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the representation was made innocently, negligently or fraudulently, or whether it induced SRA to enter into the Agreement. The conclusion is that I do not accept that SRA would have been entitled to rescind the Agreement for misrepresentation. Accordingly, SRA’s submission that it can raise misrepresentation as a defence to SSA’s claim falls away.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Types of loss indemnifiable under cl 10</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Having dealt with the submissions premised on SRA’s claim to be entitled to set aside the Agreement, I turn to examine the submissions which were premised on cl 10 being valid and binding on the parties. The first of these submissions may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An indemnity clause only applies to claims by a third party against the indemnified party and not losses suffered by the indemnified party itself.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Since SSA’s loss refers solely to the cost of demolition incurred <span class="font-italic">by</span> SSA, it is merely a loss suffered by SSA itself, and thus outside the scope of cl 10.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To the extent that SSA claims that the cost of demolition was incurred in fulfilment of contractual obligations owed by SSA to Sport Singapore under to cl 5.15 of the NSC sub-lease, this also falls outside the scope of cl 10 of the Agreement as Sport Singapore had not made any claims against SSA for breach of cl 5.15 of the sub-lease. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In support of the proposition at [111(a)] above, SRA cited <span class="font-italic">BR Energy (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v KS Energy Services Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 1154<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">BR Energy</span>”), where Belinda Ang J found at [149] that the indemnity clause in that case only applied to claims by third parties against the indemnified party.

Apart from the term “losses” which is equivocal, all the other terms used in the clause (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> “claims”, “proceedings”, “liabilities”, “damages” and “costs and expenses (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis)”) clearly connote third party claims. In comparison, while cl 10 of the Agreement also contains terms referring to third party claims (“claims, demands, writs, summonses, actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, orders, decrees, damages, penalties”), there are terms in cl 10 for which no equivalents could be found in the <span class="font-italic">BR Energy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>clause, such as “costs (including repair costs to reinstate the Club Range)” and “expenses of <span class="font-italic">any nature whatsoever</span> which the SSA may <span class="font-italic">suffer or incur</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In my view, the phrase “the SSA may suffer or incur” clearly encompasses losses suffered by SSA. Further, the reference to “costs (including repair costs to reinstate the Club Range)”, while making clear that SSA could be indemnified under cl 10 for repair costs it incurred independently of any third party claims, also makes clear that the word “costs”, which was partially defined by the phrase “including repair costs to reinstate the Club Range”, is not limited to costs arising from third party claim. For these reasons, I do not accept SRA’s submission that cl 10 applies only to claims by third parties against SSA and not to losses suffered by SSA itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Having found that cl 10 covers losses suffered by SSA itself, there is no need for me to go on to consider the final limb of SRA’s submission outlined at [111(c)] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of implied term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 SRA’s final submission is along these lines:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) SSA is not entitled to claim an indemnity under cl 10 for a loss stemming from SSA’s own breach of the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is an implied term in the Agreement that SSA would use reasonable efforts to allow and/or assist SRA to obtain the necessary regulatory approval. Further or in the alternative, there is an implied term that SSA would not demolish the structures erected by SRA pursuant to the Agreement without first using reasonable efforts to allow and/or assist SRA to regularise the structures.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The demolition of the structures stemmed from SSA’s breach the said implied term or terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The proposition at (a) above is uncontroversial and is not disputed by SSA. Examples of local cases where this principle was applied include <span class="font-italic">BR Energy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [149] and <span class="font-italic">Kay Lim Construction &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v Soon Douglas (Pte) Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1 at [45] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Quentin Loh J. It is, in essence, an application of the oft-cited canon of construction that a contract will be interpreted, so far as possible, in such a manner as not to permit one party to take advantage of his own wrong: see Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2015) at pp 404–408. Instead, the contest between the parties is on the existence of the implied term contended for by SRA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Implying the term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The implication of terms in a contract involves three steps, as laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) at [101] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sundaresh Menon CJ. First, the court must ascertain how the gap arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the issue at all. Second, the court must consider whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term to give the contract efficacy. Third, the court must consider the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded, “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract. In my judgment, SRA satisfies this test in relation to its submission that there is an implied term that SSA would use reasonable efforts to assist SRA with obtaining planning and building approval for the purpose of constructing the Club Range.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) First step: Determining how the gap arose</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 To apply the first step, it is first necessary to ascertain whether there is a gap to be filled by the term sought to be implied. It can be inferred from the term which SRA sought to imply that, at least on SRA’s case, the gap to be filled is the absence of provisions in the Agreement concerning SSA’s role in relation to the regulatory approval process for the Club Range. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It is undisputed that the Agreement is silent on SSA’s role and responsibilities in relation to the regulatory approval process for the construction of the Club Range. The closest that the Agreement comes to dealing with the regulatory approval process is in cl 3.2, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[SRA] shall bear all costs, including <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, architect fees, BCA fess, GFA levies, construction costs and all costs required to obtain approvals and to meet the safety requirements of the SSA in relation to the construction of the Club Range.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As is evident from the above quotation, cl 3.2 merely provides that SRA is to bear all costs required to obtain relevant approvals. No provision is made on which party is responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals. I therefore accept that there is a gap in the Agreement concerning SRA’s and SSA’s respective roles and responsibilities in relation to the regulatory approval process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The next question is whether the parties addressed themselves to this gap when they entered into the Agreement. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>at [94], there are at least three ways in which a gap could arise:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the parties did not contemplate the issue at all and so left a gap;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide a term for it because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had adequately addressed it; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide any term for it because they could not agree on a solution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> that only scenario (a) amounts to a “true” gap, in that it is “the only instance where it would be appropriate for the court to even consider if it will imply a term into the parties’ contract” ([95]). In contrast, scenarios (b) and (c) are cases where parties’ <span class="font-italic">actual </span>intentions can be ascertained, thus leaving no room for implication of terms (at [95]–[96]). In the present case, there is no evidence that either scenario (b) or scenario (c) applies. SSA gave the draft Agreement to SRA on a Thursday or Friday afternoon for SRA to sign by Tuesday noon, failing which SSA would offer the Agreement to other clubs.

</div> There is no evidence that the parties negotiated over the text of the Agreement, much less that they had contemplated the issue and decided not to provide for it. Nor is there any evidence that, at the time the Agreement was signed, the parties mistakenly believed that the issue had already been provided for in the Agreement. In the absence of evidence that either scenario (b) or (c) applies, I find that scenario (a) applies and that the present case involves a “true” gap.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Second step: Considering whether implication of a term is necessary to give the contract efficacy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 As there is a “true” gap arising from the absence of provisions in the Agreement on SSA’s role in the approval procedure, the next step is to consider whether it is necessary to imply a term to fill this gap in order to give the contract efficacy. I begin by observing that the central purpose of the Agreement is for the construction of the Club Range at the NSC. To the extent that such construction involves regulatory approvals, the acquisition of such approvals would be necessary for achieving the intended purpose of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Next, it is undisputed that given SSA’s position both as lessee of the NSC from Sport Singapore and as the NSA for the sport of shooting, it was not possible for SRA to obtain regulatory approvals or even communicate with authorities such as BCA or URA in relation to the Club Range without SSA’s cooperation. In fact, SSA concedes in its closing submissions that SSA had to act as a conduit between SRA on the one hand and Sport Singapore and the regulatory authorities on the other hand.

</div> between SRA on the one hand and Sport Singapore and BCA on the other, I hold that the gap concerning SSA’s role in the approval process is one that is necessary to be filled in order to give the Agreement efficacy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Third step: Determining the specific term to be implied</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Finally, I must determine the content of the term that ought to be implied. The question is whether the term proposed would elicit a “Oh, of course!” from the parties if it had been put to them by an officious bystander at the time of the drafting the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 As outlined at [117(b)] above, SRA asks the court to imply two separate terms – an implied term that SSA would use reasonable efforts to allow and/or assist SRA to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the construction of the Club Range and an implied term that SSA would refrain from demolishing the structures which SRA erected towards the construction of the Club Range without first using reasonable efforts to allow and/or assist SRA to regularise the structures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In my view, SRA’s submission for the implication of two separate terms concerning two different stages of the approval process unnecessarily complicates the issues. I see the two implied terms proposed by SRA as two sides of the same coin – they both relate to the need for SSA’s assistance to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals at whatever stage it is sought. This would include approvals before commencement of construction as well as retrospective approvals during or after construction (such retrospective approval would fall within the ambit of “regularisation” as that term was used by parties during the trial and in their submissions). In this regard, I am of the view that it is sufficient to imply a single term into the Agreement that SSA would use reasonable efforts to assist SRA in obtaining any necessary regulatory approval at any stage of the construction process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 SSA submits that its role in the approval procedure “was merely as a conduit”.

</div>  If by this is meant that SSA was responsible only for transmission of documents and information up and down the chain without giving its own input or being involved in discussions or meetings with Sport Singapore or the regulatory authorities where needed, I think it would fail the officious bystander test for setting too low a standard. In any event, even if SSA is right that SSA’s obligation under the term to be implied is limited to that of being a mere conduit of information, it will be apparent from the discussion at [143] below that SSA had breached even this more limited obligation when it failed to inform SRA that BCA had offered the option of regularisation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In this regard, it is instructive that Mr Vaz himself thought that the Agreement imposed certain obligations on SSA in relation to the approval process.

In other words, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Giap Hon </span>appeared to have accepted that certain implied terms could be regarded as terms “contained” within the agreement, with the result that such implied terms would not be caught by a clause seeking to excluding matters not contained within the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Court of Appeal then went on to make the following observations (at [31]–[32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, we would also pause to observe that, even if there is no reference to implied terms in an entire agreement clause, it is arguable that the presence of such a clause in a contract would not, as a matter of general principle, exclude the implication of terms into that contract for several reasons. First, an implied term, by its <span class="font-italic">very nature</span> (as an <span class="font-italic">implied</span> term), would <span class="font-italic">not</span>, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, have been in the contemplation of the contracting parties to begin with when they entered into the contract. Secondly, if a term were implied on, so to speak, a “broader” basis “in law” (as opposed to on a “narrower” basis “in fact”), it would follow, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, that such a term would not have been in the contemplation of the parties for, as we shall see below (at [38]), a term which is implied “in law” (unlike a term which is implied “in fact”) is not premised on the presumed intention of the contracting parties as such. Thirdly, it is clearly established law that a term <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be implied if it is <span class="font-italic">inconsistent with</span> an <span class="font-italic">express</span> term of the contract concerned. This principle is, of course, both logical as well as commonsensical. Finally, as pointed out by Nigel Teare QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court) in <span class="font-italic">Exxonmobil</span><span class="font-italic"> Sales and Supply Corp v Texaco Ltd</span> [2004] 1 All ER (Comm) 435 at [27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It [is] … arguable that where it is necessary to imply a term in order to make the express terms work such an implied term may not be excluded by [an] entire agreement clause <span class="font-italic">because</span> it could be said that such a term is to be found <span class="font-italic">in</span> the document or documents forming part of the contract. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That having been said, we are <span class="font-italic">not</span> prepared to state that an entire agreement clause can never exclude the implication of terms into a contract.

Further, if the effect of the language used renders the entire agreement clause, in substance, an exception clause, the clause would be subject to both the relevant common law constraints on exclusion clauses as well as the UCTA (reference may also be made to Elisabeth Peden &amp; J W Carter, “Entire Agreement – and Similar – Clauses” (2006) 22 JCL 1 at 8–9; <span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(not surprisingly, perhaps) a similar approach towards the utilisation of the factual matrix of a contract as an interpretative tool where the contract contains an entire agreement clause (see [27] above)).

It reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The entire agreement clause was also relied upon by Exxonmobil in seeking to defeat the argument that a term should be implied based upon business efficacy. <span class="font-italic">I have not, on that account, rejected Texaco’s argument that a term should be implied on the grounds of business efficacy</span>.

In other words, <span class="font-italic">the implied terms are said to be intrinsic to the agreements</span>, and true implications. In my judgment, such terms, if otherwise to be implied, are not excluded by clause 24. <span class="font-italic">As intrinsic provisions of the agreement, they are within the expression “This Agreement and the Schedules and documents referred to herein”</span> in the first sentence, and they are not “prior” to the agreement, and therefore are unaffected by the second sentence.

As for the presence in cl 15 of the phrase “all conditions, warranties or other terms implied by statute or by common law are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law”, the phrase could be read to refer only to terms implied in law, to the exclusion of terms implied in fact. (Terms implied in fact would include terms implied based on business efficacy.) While I appreciate that in some contract law textbooks, the phrase “terms implied at common law” is used to refer to both terms implied in fact and terms implied in law, this manner of classification is by no means universally adopted. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the phrase “terms implied by statute or by common law” <span class="font-italic">clearly and unambiguously</span> refers to terms implied based on business efficacy as a <span class="font-italic">specific</span> category of terms to be excluded.

</div> This statement is clearly untrue as BCA, through the issuance of the regularisation letter, kept the window for regularisation open. Further, when SRA’s representative at the meeting asked if there was a complaint about the Club Range which led to BCA’s demolition order, Mr Vaz did not admit to having made any complaints to BCA.

On the contrary, Mr Vaz’s misrepresentation of the situation impeded SRA’s ability and effort to seek regularisation by causing SRA, firstly, not to understand that BCA was open to regularisation and, secondly, not to appreciate the nature of the complaints and concerns which led to BCA’s demolition order.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In relation to item (e), after SRA found out from BCA that regularisation of the structures was possible, SSA deliberately obstructed SRA’s efforts to seek regularisation.

</div> Instead of cooperating with SRA and BCA towards regularisation, SSA flatly refused to attend the meeting, thereby cutting off SRA’s hope of regularising the Club Range and salvaging the more than $300,000 of members’ moneys invested by SRA in constructing the Club Range. Mr Vaz sought to explain during trial that he did this to protect Sport Singapore from possible prosecution by BCA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 This explanation is illogical. As it was BCA who first offered the option of regularisation by issuing the regularisation letter and subsequently offered to host discussions on regularisation, it is inconceivable that SSA’s participation in such discussions <span class="font-italic">with BCA</span>,<span class="font-italic"> at BCA’s invitation</span>, could somehow put Sport Singapore in jeopardy of prosecution by BCA. In the end, Mr Vaz conceded during cross-examination that the decision not to collaborate with SRA and BCA on regularisation was taken solely by SSA, and without any order from or consultation with Sport Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In conclusion, SSA was obliged to take reasonable efforts to assist SRA in obtaining building approval from BCA. These efforts include informing SRA of the regularisation option offered by BCA and assisting SRA with its communications and engagements with BCA towards regularisation. SSA did exactly the opposite. In doing so, it breached an implied term under the Agreement. The effect of SSA’s breach was to render the demolition the Club Range the only possible outcome. In the circumstances, it is clear that the cost of the demolition stems from SSA’s breach of the implied term. I therefore hold that SSA cannot rely on cl 10 to claim an indemnity for that cost. For this reason, I dismiss SSA’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An alternative analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I should also mention that even if SRA did not rely on the argument that SSA breached an implied term of the Agreement, there would still be sufficient basis to dismiss SSA’s counterclaim on the ground that SSA’s unilateral decision to demolish the structures broke the chain of causation between SRA’s actions and the cost incurred for demolishing the structures, thereby bringing such costs outside the scope of cl 10. As this was not a point on which the parties submitted, I will only deal with it briefly for completeness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As noted at [113] above, cl 10 requires SRA to indemnify SSA for “losses and expenses of any nature whatsoever which the SSA may suffer or incur for any death, injury, loss and/or damage <span class="font-italic">caused directly or indirectly by its activities</span>, including the activities of its members, employees, independent contractors, agents, invitees or other permitted occupier at the Property” (emphasis added). I consider that SSA’s loss was not “caused directly or indirectly” by SRA’s building of the Club Range within the meaning of cl 10 of the Agreement. The evidence is clear that demolition of the Club Range was never a forgone conclusion for anyone other than Mr Vaz. It will be recalled that on 6 November 2015, BCA wrote to Sport Singapore and asked it either to tear down the Club Range or to take steps to regularise it. BCA left the choice to Sport Singapore and did not require Sport Singapore to prefer demolition over regularisation. Sport Singapore communicated those two options to SSA, and similarly did not require SSA to prefer demolition over regularisation. It was Mr Vaz who, within a day of receiving that information, promptly and unilaterally decided on 11 November 2015 that SSA would choose the option of demolishing the Club Range.

</div> BCA was ready to talk, and SRA was prepared to take steps to regularise. Thus, not only did BCA offer the option of regularisation, as of 27 November 2015, which was after the deadline of 20 November 2015 for responding to the regularisation letter, BCA was still initiating a meeting with SSA and SRA so that the parties could discuss the matter.

</div> but this simply ignores the context of the accompanying regularisation letter. Second, Mr Vaz claimed that as SRA, for much of 2015, had not been forthcoming with documents necessary for regulatory approvals, there was no reason to believe that SRA could meet BCA’s 20 November 2015 deadline for regularisation.

</div>
</div> SRA’s response to this claim is that SSA never made it clear to SRA that the documents it had submitted to SSA were inadequate for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval. While I accept that SRA may have been dilatory in its approach towards obtaining regulatory approval, there is no evidence that SRA was unwilling to cooperate to obtain such approval at what SRA believed (rightly or wrongly) was the appropriate time. The persons involved in the project on SRA’s side are professionals in the construction industry who are familiar with the planning and building approval process, and it is clear from the correspondence that they were working towards obtaining the relevant approvals. Consequently, there was no basis for Mr Vaz’s supposition that SRA would be dilatory in responding to the regularisation letter accompanying the demolition order. Had SRA been informed of the regularisation letter, it would have known that acting promptly pursuant to the regularisation letter would be the way to avoid the $300,000 of members’ money poured into the construction of the Club Range going to waste. Unfortunately, SSA deprived SRA of this opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The truth is that Mr Vaz jumped the gun. He was unhappy that SRA did not do things in exactly the way he wanted.  It is also relevant that, at about this time, there were brewing disputes between SSA and SRA on other fronts, including the implementation of further security measures for the armouries. As I have mentioned, SSA blew the whistle on SRA by writing secretly to BCA to complain of the structures. Unhappy with BCA’s lack of response, Mr Vaz wrote personally to ask BCA urgently to order the demolition of the new structures built by SRA. Mr Vaz used the phrase “illegal structures” to describe these structures when there appeared to be no solid ground at that time for Mr Vaz to conclude that the structures were illegal: see [13] above. When BCA acted, and SRA asked who could have alerted BCA, Mr Vaz did not claim responsibility. Instead, he deceitfully claimed that anyone could have written the letter, thus hiding his role from SRA. Mr Vaz also hid the regularisation letter from SRA, showing it only the demolition order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It was Mr Vaz’s course of conduct, and those in the SSA council who supported it, that were the cause of the cost SSA incurred in demolishing the Club Range. SRA’s building of the Club Range was at most a “but for” cause, in the sense that it merely provided the occasion for that cost to be incurred. It was not an effective or proximate cause of that cost, and thus not a cause coming within the ambit of cl 10. Even if SRA’s building of the Club Range had been a cause of the incurring of that cost, SSA broke the chain of causation through Mr Vaz’s orchestration of the events described at [149]–[153] above. Had SSA not written secretly to BCA, there would very likely not have been a demolition order, and SRA would very likely have succeeded in obtaining the regulatory approvals it planned to obtain at the time it planned to obtain them. Further, had SSA not hidden BCA’s regularisation letter from SRA and not deliberately obstruct SRA’s efforts at regularisation, SRA would very likely have succeeded in obtaining regularisation since it was BCA’s opinion that the structures posed no danger.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In conclusion, even when the facts are analysed purely in terms of causation, without taking into account possible implied terms, it is clear that the cost of demolition was not caused by SRA’s activities but by SSA’s actions. SSA’s attempt to rely on cl 10 to claim the cost of demolition from SRA must therefore fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 There is one other question I should address before concluding the discussion on causation: Does the fact that the same legal conclusion on SSA’s counterclaim could be reached by a causation analysis without reliance on implied terms mean that the implied term which I have found at [127] above is not “necessary” for the purpose of giving business efficacy to the Agreement? The answer, in my view, is “no”, as the business efficacy test asks whether it is necessary to imply a term to give business efficacy to the operation of a contract as a whole, and not whether it is necessary to imply a term to allow or defeat a specific legal claim arising from a particular set of facts. In any event, the two analyses do not lead to identical legal results. While both the implied term analysis and the causation analysis would afford SRA a defence against SSA’s claim, the implied term analysis would, in addition, afford SRA a claim against SSA for breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 For all the reasons above, I accept SRA’s claim and reject SSA’s counterclaim. I therefore make the following declarations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The circular resolution suspending SRA’s privileges at the NSC is null and void.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) SSA has no power to suspend the rights of its members save as expressly provided for in SSA’s constitution.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Unless and until SSA’s constitution is amended to provide otherwise, the SSA council does not have the power to make decisions by circular resolution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I make no order on SRA’s application for declarations that SSA has no right to seek armoury licences and no right to regulate the usage or mode of the storage of firearms. SSA purports to exercise such rights through various terms in the circular resolution. SRA therefore claims that SSA does not have any such rights, and that is yet another reason why the circular resolution is void. It is not necessary for me to decide this issue given my conclusion on the resolution’s validity. In any event, I do not think that it properly arises in this case because apart from SSA’s power to suspend a member, SSA’s other powers are not genuinely in issue in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Finally, I also order that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Vaz, Mr Yap and Mr Chen are to pay SRA damages in the amount equivalent to the legal fees and disbursements incurred by SRA in investigating and responding to the conspiracy, such fees and disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) SSA’s counterclaim is dismissed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Pang Khang Chau  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Teo Ying Ying Denise and Tan Si Ying Evelyn (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Lee Hwee Khiam Anthony and Huineng Clement Chen (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
