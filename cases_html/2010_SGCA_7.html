        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court given in <em>Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings
                        Ltd and another</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 111 (“the
                    GD”). The subject matter of the dispute involves the alleged oppression
                    of a minority shareholder, Over &amp; Over Ltd (“O&amp;O”), by
                    Bonvests Holdings Ltd (“Bonvests”) in relation to their joint
                    venture company, Richvein Pte Ltd (“Richvein”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Richvein was incorporated as a joint-venture
                    company on 20 August 1980, with Unicurrent Finance Limited
                    (“Unicurrent”) as its majority shareholder and O&amp;O as its
                    minority shareholder. Unicurrent held 70% of the shares in Richvein, while
                    O&amp;O held the remaining 30%. After its incorporation, Richvein purchased land
                    at Scotts Road and developed on it a hotel called the Sheraton Towers Singapore
                    (“the Hotel”). The construction of the Hotel was completed in
                    December 1985 and the Hotel continues to operate successfully at the same
                    premises to date. It remains Richvein’s sole business
                venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       O&amp;O, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, is
                    controlled by the Lauw family. Lauw Siang Liong (“LSL”) and John
                    Loh (“JL”) are O&amp;O’s shareholders and directors.
                    Unicurrent and Bonvests are controlled by the Sianandar family, in particular by
                    Henry Ngo (“HN”). When queried by this Court in the course of this
                    appeal, counsel for the respondent, Mr Alvin Yeo SC
                    (“Mr Yeo”), accepted that that about 60% of Bonvests is
                    currently owned by HN and his family members, that is to say, the Sianandar
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 1979, the Sianandar family committed
                    themselves to the purchase of a piece of land along Scotts Road to develop the
                    Hotel. To spread the commercial risks, they sought a partner for the venture. A
                    mutual friend introduced LSL to Ditju Sianandar (“DS”), the elder
                    brother of HN. Having ascertained LSL’s interest in co-investing, DS left
                    it to HN to continue the discussions. The two brothers were then
                    Unicurrent’s only shareholders, with 99% of the shares held by HN and the
                    remaining 1% by DS. Unfortunately, both LSL and DS were unable to assist the
                    trial court in reconstructing the basis of their original discussions. At [7] of
                    the GD, the trial judge (“the Judge”) found that LSL had a
                    “failing memory” and DS’s evidence was “shaky and
                    unreliable”. As they were the key individuals who had made the first
                    contact between the two families on the nature and objectives of this joint
                    venture their evidence was important. Ultimately, the Judge had little
                    alternative but to deduce from the partisan evidence of HN and JL the history
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the broadest of strokes, it can be said that
                    the parties contemplated that Richvein was to be incorporated as the
                    joint-venture vehicle between the Lauws’ O&amp;O and the Sianandars’
                    Unicurrent, both of which were privately held family entities. It was only much
                    later that the shareholding held by Unicurrent was transferred to Bonvests, a
                    listed public company (see below at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The discussions between HN and the Lauw family
                    leading to the incorporation of Richvein were informal and plainly based on
                    mutual trust. No documentary records of the various discussions between the
                    parties were maintained. Further, despite the substantial investment being made
                    by both parties, their understanding was not embodied in any shareholders’
                    agreement or in Richvein’s memorandum and articles of
                association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Although their discussions were not documented,
                    it is now not disputed that there were nevertheless certain core understandings
                    that governed the relationship between the Lauws and the Sianandars <em>vis-à-vis</em> Richvein. The parties had agreed, at the
                    outset, that both families would always be represented on Richvein’s board
                    of directors, in a ratio of two Sianandar representatives to one Lauw
                    representative. It was also agreed that the proposed building costs of the hotel
                    would be funded by the two families in the proportion of 70%:30%, with the
                    Sianandars responsible for the larger share. The families also agreed that the
                    profits and losses of Richvein were to be shared between them in proportion to
                    their respective shareholdings of 70% and 30% respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The joint venture investment eventually required
                    a huge financial commitment from both parties. Richvein presently has a paid-up
                    share capital of more than $157m, all of which has been fully funded by the
                    parties in proportion to their shareholdings. According to O&amp;O, as at
                    December 2002, it alone had loaned, interest-free, approximately $37.8m to
                    Richvein. These shareholder loans had by then already been in existence for more
                    than a decade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Strict proportionate numerical accounting in
                    corporate decision making aside, it had also been agreed from the outset that
                    the Sianandar family would consult the Lauw family on any important decisions
                    relating to the operations and management of Richvein (“the Important
                    Decision Term”). This was notwithstanding the fact that the Lauw family
                    was in the minority, both in terms of shareholding and representation on
                    Richvein’s board of directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Hotel was duly constructed and operated by
                    Richvein. Initially, the Hotel’s operations proceeded smoothly and the
                    working relationship between the parties was uneventful. Whenever any important
                    issue affecting the operations or management of Richvein arose, HN would consult
                    with the Lauw family before making any decision. This accorded with the
                    Important Decision Term. In July 1991, however, HN unilaterally terminated an
                    extant hotel management contract with ITT Sheraton Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“ITT Sheraton”) without consulting the Lauw family. O&amp;O
                    alleged that he did this in order to divert the hotel management contract to
                    another company in which he held a substantial interest; namely, Henrick
                    International Hotels &amp; Resorts Pte Ltd (“HIHR”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     HN responded by explaining that HIHR had the
                    necessary expertise to manage the hotel. He stated that it was not feasible to
                    have Richvein manage the Hotel itself by employing the necessary people because
                    Richvein had already undertaken to provide compensation packages that specified
                    stock participation for two key employees in HIHR. Under Richvein’s
                    original plan, 25% of the shares in HIHR would be held by the two employees,
                    with Bonvests holding the remaining 75% of HIHR’s shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Eventually, the impasse between the parties
                    was resolved by having Richvein incorporate a subsidiary, Henrick Singapore
                    (“HS”), to manage the Hotel. Richvein would hold 75% of the shares
                    in HS, and the remaining 25% would be held by the two key employees. With this
                    compromise in place, the changes in oversight of the Hotel’s operations
                    were implemented. However, it appears from the testimony of the parties that the
                    previously warm relationship between the parties had distinctly cooled as a
                    result of this run-in. Indeed, following the incorporation of HS, the friendship
                    that had been enjoyed between the Sianandar and Lauw families gradually segued
                    into what one might mildly term as neutrality. Communications between the
                    parties over the next decade were brief and limited to formal business issues,
                    usually tabled at board meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In 2002, when the two key employees left HS,
                    HN decided that it was no longer necessary to keep HS alive. HN suggested to JL
                    that HS be liquidated and that Richvein contract directly with HIHR, in order to
                    save on the compliance costs incurred in maintaining HS. JL objected to this
                    suggestion, noting that O&amp;O would be worse off as a result of this
                    arrangement as it would have no direct or indirect interest in or control over
                    HIHR, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bonvests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Notwithstanding O&amp;O’s objections, HN
                    caused a hotel management contract between Richvein and HIHR to be entered into
                    in December 2005. This was signed by HN on HIHR’s behalf and by Long Sie
                    Fong (a director of Richvein nominated by Bonvests) on Richvein’s
                        behalf<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Even
                    after it was finalised, the contract was not placed before Richvein’s
                    board of directors for ratification. Two subsequent contracts between Richvein
                    and companies which HN had interests in, one for waste disposal services and
                    another for cleaning services, were also not placed before or approved by
                    Richvein’s board of directors. Neither was O&amp;O consulted about them
                    before they were entered into. O&amp;O alleges that as a result of these
                    unratified contracts the Important Decision Term had once again been
                    unheeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At around the same time in 2002, HN determined
                    that it would be preferable that his public-listed company, Bonvests, acquire
                    Unicurrent’s 70% shareholding in Richvein. This arrangement would
                    effectively unlock the value of the Sianandar’s family interest in
                    Richvein as the value of their disposable share interests in Bonvests would
                    increase commensurately once the acquisition was completed. However, as an
                    outright sale by Unicurrent of its shares in Richvein to a third party was
                    prohibited by Richvein’s Articles of Association, O&amp;O’s consent
                    was required. HN, therefore, proceeded to enter into discussions with JL on the
                    possibility of arranging such a sale, warning JL at the same time that if
                    O&amp;O did not consent to Unicurrent’s sale of its shares in Richvein to
                    Bonvests, this would make little difference as Bonvests could simply employ the
                    “back-door approach” of buying over all of Unicurrent’s
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Confronted by the harsh reality that HN could
                    effectively do as he pleased on this issue without O&amp;O’s consent, JL
                    reluctantly consented to the sale. However, he tried to salvage something from
                    the situation by seeking the removal of Article 30 of Richvein’s
                    Articles of Association, which vests a right of pre-emption in either party
                    (“Article 30”). The removal of Article 30 meant that, if
                    they wanted to, the shareholders could transfer their shares to any third party
                    notwithstanding that the transferee was not an existing member of
                    Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Matters finally came to a head between the two
                    families in 2006. In September 2006, HN received from the Development Bank of
                    Singapore Limited (“DBS”) an offer to refinance an outstanding
                    Richvein loan for $25m. The loan was due for repayment by November 2007. JL
                    refused to agree to the proposed refinancing package, stating that he was
                    unhappy about having to extend his personal guarantee whereas HN was not
                    required to do so as the Sianandar’s family interests in Richvein was now
                    held through Bonvests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On learning of JL’s stance, HN
                    immediately decided that a rights issue would be an appropriate mechanism to pay
                    off the loan. Despite objections and repeated requests from JL for documents and
                    for an analysis of the cash flow requirements of Richvein – in order to
                    determine whether a rights issue could be <em>properly</em>
                    justified – the rights issue was hastily completed by HN by the end of
                    October 2006, at an issue price of $0.38 per rights share. An internal
                    memorandum that surfaced in the course of the trial from Kwa Bing Seng
                    (“KBS”), the financial controller of Richvein, to HN indicates
                    that $0.3728 was the price that would “<em>result in the
                        maximum dilution of [O&amp;O]’s share if it does not take up the
                        rights</em>” [emphasis added], see below at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>. That same memorandum also indicated that the
                    audited net asset per Richvein share adjusted for revaluation of land and
                    building as of December 2005 was $1.0622.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Not long after this, O&amp;O initiated this
                    claim for relief against oppressive and/or unfairly prejudicial conduct under
                    s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Companies Act”) in 2007. Broadly speaking, O&amp;O alleges that the
                    respondent’s conduct disclosed three obvious episodes of oppressive
                    conduct. We shall now set out these alleged instances of oppression in greater
                    detail, starting first with the contracts Richvein entered into with the various
                    companies in which HN and/or Bonvests held an interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Related Party Transactions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     These contracts were (collectively, the
                    “Related Party Transactions”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     a contract dated 11 May 2006
                        with Colex Holdings Ltd (“Colex Holdings”) for waste disposal
                        services (the “Colex Contract”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     a contract dated 28 July 2006 with
                        Integrated Property Management Pte Ltd (“IPM”) for cleaning
                        services (the “IPM Contract”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     a contract dated 12 December 2005
                        with HIHR for hotel management services (the “HIHR
                        Contract”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is common ground that Bonvests and/or HN
                    had substantial shareholdings in Colex Holdings, IPM and HIHR. Between 1984 and
                    1992, HN gave notices to Richvein’s directors stating his interest in
                    these three related companies. Richvein’s audited accounts also listed
                    significant transactions with related parties, although no specific names were
                    disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Both the Colex Contract and the IPM Contract
                    were in fact renewals of contracts that had been entered into almost a decade
                    ago. Richvein had entered into a contract with Colex (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“Colex (Singapore)”, the precursor to Colex Holdings) from as
                    early as 1997. Between 1997 and 2006, Richvein entered into several renewal
                    contracts with Colex (Singapore) and Colex Holdings for waste disposal services.
                    Colex (Singapore), now known as Colex Holdings, became a listed company in
                    1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Richvein entered into a contract with IPM for
                    two years in 1998. This contract was primarily for the maintenance of common
                    areas and car park and for carpet cleaning. In both 2000 and 2002, Richvein
                    entered into two-year renewal contracts with IPM. In 2004, 2005 and 2006,
                    Richvein again contracted with IPM for daily and periodic cleaning services, but
                    this time for a term of one year each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The HIHR Contract, by contrast, has a longer
                    and more involved history. Prior to July 1991, Richvein had a hotel management
                    contract with ITT Sheraton. In July 1991, however, this contract was
                    unilaterally terminated by HN, who then sought to enter into a management
                    contract with another company in which he held a substantial interest, HIHR. The
                    ostensible reason for this was that HIHR had the necessary expertise to manage
                    the Hotel, and the fact that there would be cost savings in choosing HIHR over
                    ITT Sheraton. On 19 July 1991, HN wrote to the Lauw family, asking them to
                    sign, within seven days, a resolution permitting Richvein to enter into a
                    management contract with HIHR. On 25 July 1991, JL wrote back asking for
                    more time to consider the HIHR proposal. JL also raised a number of
                    concerns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Subsequently, a 5% interest in HIHR was
                    promised to the Lauw family if they gave their consent to HN in relation to the
                    proposed grant of the hotel management contract to HIHR. Nonetheless, in a
                    second letter dated 1 August 1991, JL raised further queries. JL took issue
                    with the fact that despite feasibility studies to form HIHR having allegedly
                    been carried out some 19 months before, O&amp;O was only informed of HN’s
                    intention to sign a new management contract with HIHR only
                recently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The problem, as JL saw it, was that HIHR would
                    be paid by Richvein, and that 30% of that payment would be in reality coming
                    from O&amp;O. If HIHR did not perform, HN would lose little because he would
                    essentially be transferring his own funds from one company (Bonvests) to another
                    (HIHR), while JL would be out of pocket. By engaging HIHR, HN would effectively
                    obtain a cost-free premium of 30% from JL. JL therefore proposed that the
                    management of the Hotel be taken over by Richvein, employing the same persons
                    whose expertise HN claimed HIHR had. However, JL further added that if HN
                    intended to proceed with the contract with HIHR, O&amp;O would be
                    “prepared in principle to sell all their shares in
                        Richvein”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A week later, on 8 August 1991, JL sent a
                        <em>third</em> letter to HN, even before receiving any
                    response from HN to his second letter. In this third letter, JL did not mince
                    his words<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>At the outset, I would like to say that it pains me
                            that I have to write this letter especially since the Ngo family and the
                            Lauw family have been good family friends for so many years</em>.
                        It was a surprise to me that although studies into the feasibility to form
                        [HIHR] began 19 months ago, [O&amp;O] were only informed about the details
                        of the Management Contract recently when I was asked to sign the
                        Directors’ Resolution approving the Management Contract. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">JL then reiterated his proposal that Richvein take over the management
                    of the Hotel by employing the same people whose expertise HN had claimed to be
                    justified in engaging HIHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 2 September 1991, Richvein responded
                    to JL, saying that it was not possible for Richvein to manage the Hotel itself
                    by employing the necessary “key staff of proven
                        expertise”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> because it would have to provide
                    compensation packages that included stock participation for at least two of
                    these key employees. Under Richvein’s original plan, 25% of the shares in
                    HIHR would be held by the two employees, Carl Kono and William Hau. Bonvests
                    would hold the remaining 75% of HIHR’s shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The impasse was finally resolved at a board
                    meeting held on 23 September 1991 by having Richvein – and not HIHR
                    – incorporate HS. HS was to be 75% held by Richvein and 25% held by Carl
                    Kono and William Hau. Accordingly, Richvein would enter into a management
                    contract with HS and HS would <em>subcontract</em> with
                    HIHR to provide hotel management services (the “three-tier
                    arrangement”). From O&amp;O’s point of view, this compromise was
                    preferable to Richvein’s earlier proposal that HIHR incorporate HS as a
                    subsidiary and for O&amp;O to subscribe for shares therein, since that course of
                    action would leave the Sianandar family with the ability to maintain and
                    exercise full control over HIHR and, indirectly, HS via its established 60%
                    shareholding in Bonvests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In 2002, the two key employees left HS. HN
                    then decided that the reasons for setting up both HS and the three-tier
                    arrangement were no longer applicable, and accordingly informed JL that Richvein
                    intended to terminate the contract with HS. HN further informed JL that Bonvests
                    (which was going to take over Unicurrent’s shareholding in Richvein) would
                    instead provide administrative support to Richvein, and that HIHR would take
                    over the provision of the management services for the Hotel. However, O&amp;O
                    rejected this proposed arrangement in a letter dated 26 April
                2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It bears mention that while JL was informed of
                    the administrative service contract agreement with Bonvests on 26 March
                    2002, Richvein had in fact already executed the agreement <em>a
                        week before</em> on 18 March 2002. HN and another director
                    nominated by the majority also signed a Richvein board resolution dated
                    18 March 2002, which was then sent to JL on 26 March 2002, requesting
                    that JL sign it as if the decision had already been made. The following exchange
                    that took place when HN was cross-examined is illuminating: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     JL did not sign the board resolution dated
                    18 March 2002 and the issue of the proposed management contract with HIHR
                    (and the termination of HS) was postponed at Richvein’s annual general
                    meeting (“AGM”) on 29 May 2002. Specifically, HN agreed with
                    LSL’s request that any decision on the management contract with HIHR be
                    deferred until Richvein’s next AGM. In the following year, HN again
                    proposed, in a letter dated 15 January 2003, that HS be liquidated and that
                    the Richvein contract be concluded directly with HIHR. The purported reason for
                    this was to save on compliance costs for Richvein in maintaining
                HS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 6 February 2003, JL’s solicitors
                    wrote to say that he was not agreeable to the proposed liquidation of HS. The
                    stated reason for this objection was the same as that given earlier in 1991:
                    that O&amp;O would have no direct or indirect interest in or control of HIHR,
                    which was wholly-owned by Bonvests. Notwithstanding JL’s objections,
                    however, HN and KBS signed a board resolution to terminate the management
                    agreement with HS on 8 December 2005. Subsequently on 12 December
                    2005, HIHR entered into a contract for hotel management services with Richvein;
                    namely, the HIHR Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is common ground that the HIHR Contract was
                    not placed before Richvein’s board of directors, and hence had not been
                    approved by the board. This was also true for the Colex Contract and the IPM
                    Contract. HN in cross-examination accepted the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>

                    Richvein’s Articles of Association, which expressly prohibits a director
                    from voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which he has an
                    interest (“Article 92”). By participating in the
                    decision-making process <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Related

                    Bonvests, to purchase Unicurrent’s 70% shareholding in Richvein,
                    ostensibly as part of an “internal group restructuring” exercise.
                    However, as earlier discussed at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above,
                    an outright sale by Unicurrent of its shares in Richvein was prohibited by

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The first reference on record of this proposed

                        Business</font>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. No prior notice had been given
                    of this proposed sale, even though the sale would be deemed to be
                    “special business” under Article 63 of Richvein’s
                    Articles of Association. By virtue of Article 59 of the same Articles of
                    Association, HN was obliged to give at least 14 days’ notice of the
                    proposed sale. HN accepted under cross-examination that he deliberately chose
                    not to inform the Lauw family of the proposed sale, ostensibly to prevent the
                    transaction from being “leaked out in the public”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     At the AGM on 29 May 2002, HN attempted
                    to pass a resolution to the effect that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">with no objections from [O&amp;O]’s representative [Mr Melvin
                        Lee Tiong Choon], [Unicurrent] would at an opportune time, sell its entire
                        shareholdings of 70,000,000 ordinary shares representing 70% of the issued
                        capital of [Richvein] to [Bonvests].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was despite the fact that Mr Melvin Lee, O&amp;O’s
                    representative at the meeting, did not have an opportunity to discuss the sale
                    of Unicurrent’s shares in Richvein with his principals, JL and
                LSL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Subsequently, implicitly recognising that the
                    regularity of this board resolution was questionable, HN attempted to persuade
                    the Lauw family to consent to the Share Transfer. However, even while doing so
                    he maintained that informing the Lauw family of the intended sale of
                    Unicurrent’s shareholding was ultimately only a matter of
                    “courtesy”. In the same breath, HN informed JL bluntly that if the
                    latter refused to permit the Share Transfer, he would arrange for Bonvests to
                    buy up all the shares in Unicurrent, thus effectively achieving the same result
                    by circumventing the spirit of the pre-emption rights that O&amp;O had pursuant
                    to Article 30 (“the back-door approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Bonvests also offered to purchase JL’s
                    shareholding, although the value that JL would have received –
                    approximately $12.7m – was considered by O&amp;O to be
                    “derisory”, and was far short of the investment that O&amp;O had
                    already made in Richvein (in the region of $37m). HN conceded during
                    cross-examination that Bonvests’ offer was “not a good
                        deal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In letters dated 17 September 2002 and
                    20 September 2002 to JL’s solicitors, HN repeated his determination
                    to proceed with the back-door approach, stating that “[t]he waiver of the
                    transfer is merely a cordiality and there is no real need to await your clients
                    to revert on it”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. This interpretation of
                    events has since been confirmed as HN, in the course of cross-examination,
                    conceded that he was simply “determined to get Bonvests as a shareholder
                    of Richvein, whether directly or through Unicurrent”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Eventually, JL reluctantly consented to the
                    Share Transfer as he realised that HN would proceed with it in one form or
                    another despite his objections. In an attempt to salvage something from this
                    difficult situation, JL sought the removal of Article 30, so that
                    thereafter any shareholder could transfer its shares to any party
                    notwithstanding that the transferee might not be an existing member of Richvein.
                    Accordingly, this amendment was passed at an EGM on 8 November 2002. The
                    Share Transfer to Bonvests was subsequently completed on or around
                    23 September 2003. In return for 62.7m new shares, Unicurrent sold its 70%
                    stake in Richvein to Bonvests. At $0.39 per Bonvests share, the deal valued
                    Unicurrent’s 70% stake in Richvein at merely $24.4m. Through this
                    arrangement, the Sianandars’ stake in Bonvests increased from 29.97% to
                    43.22% cent overnight.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Indisputably, Bonvests (and the
                    Sianandar family) benefited from this arrangement. In a circular to its
                    shareholders, Bonvests claimed to have greater synergies with this new asset in
                    its portfolio of investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The execution of the Share Transfer also meant
                    that it would now be easier for the Sianandar family to realise or monetise its
                    investment in Richvein (by selling or pledging its enlarged holding in
                    Bonvests). On the other hand, the Lauws’ minority stake remained locked in
                    Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The rights issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 25 November 2002, Richvein obtained a
                    banking facility agreement for up to $63m from DBS (“the 2002
                    Loan”). O&amp;O and JL executed corporate and personal guarantees
                    respectively for 30% of the loan facilities granted by DBS. Unicurrent and HN
                    also executed corporate and personal guarantees respectively in relation to 70%
                    of Richvein’s loan facilities. The loan tenure was five years from the
                    drawdown date and in any case was to be fully repaid by 26 November
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In 2003, after Bonvests acquired
                    Unicurrent’s 70% stake in Richvein, HN prevailed upon DBS to release him
                    as a personal guarantor. This was done without informing JL. When JL later
                    ascertained what had transpired and requested a similar release from his
                    obligations as a personal guarantor, HN was neither helpful nor sympathetic.
                    Under cross-examination, HN conceded that he was aware of JL’s displeasure
                    at having to remain as a personal guarantor but maintained that he was not
                    obliged to assist JL on this issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 16 September 2006, HN obtained a fresh
                    bank proposal for a refinancing package for the 2002 Loan. The proposed
                    refinancing package, with revised limits of $31m, required JL – but not HN
                    – to provide his personal guarantee once again. On this occasion, JL
                    refused to do so, on the basis that the collateral (the Hotel was worth some
                    $191m in October 2006) was more than sufficient security for the 2002 Loan. The
                    refinancing package was eventually not accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the course of the High Court proceedings it
                    was revealed that KBS <em>did</em> speak with a DBS officer
                    regarding the requirement for JL’s personal guarantee. In a note to HN
                    dated 26 September 2006, KBS reported that JL’s personal guarantee
                        <em>was not mandatory</em> but DBS would have to revert
                    on whether the interest rate would be revised in the
                circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As it turned out, however, there was no
                    follow-up with DBS or JL on this matter by HN. Instead, KBS and HN with unseemly
                    alacrity immediately began evaluating the feasibility of a rights issue to raise
                    funds to pay off the 2002 Loan. In a memorandum dated 2 October
                        2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>, KBS recommended that the
                    prospective new rights shares be priced at a level “<em>that will result in the maximum dilution of [O&amp;O]’s share if it
                        does not take up the rights</em>” [emphasis added]. He
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are at least three ways to price the rights issue:
                            (a) <b>$1.00</b> per share which was the
                        basis for the right [sic] issue (conversion of shareholders’ loans) in
                        2002; (b) most recently audited (i.e. FY2005) net asset per share of
                            <b>$0.3728</b>, or (c) audited net asset per
                        share adjusted for revaluation of land and building in Dec 2005 ($191
                        million) of <b>$1.0622</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In proposing a rights issue, management is entitled to believe that all
                        shareholders will show continuous support and take up its rights. <em>In my view, a pricing using audited net asset value (without
                            valuation adjustment) per share of $0.3728 (that will result in maximum
                            dilution of [O&amp;O]’s share if it does not take up the rights)
                            is not difficult to justify</em>. We can check this position with
                        our auditors and lawyers if we are pursuing this course of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On 4 October 2006, HN took steps to
                    convene a Richvein board meeting that would authorise the holding of an EGM to
                    pass a proposed rights issue (the “Rights Issue EGM”). JL sought
                    an adjournment of this board meeting on the basis that he needed more time to
                    appraise the financial and operational performance of Richvein, and thus the
                    appropriateness of any rights issue. JL also sought Richvein’s latest
                    management report which would disclose its year-to-date performance and the
                    necessary information to conduct a cash flow analysis of Richvein. Both these
                    requests were summarily rejected by HN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The board meeting was held on 11 October
                    2006 and it was resolved (<em>with JL dissenting</em>) that
                    the Rights Issue EGM would be convened on 26 October 2006. On
                    12 October 2006, O&amp;O wrote to Richvein to ask for, <em>inter alia</em>, Richvein’s profit and loss statements, but
                    Richvein replied stating that the information could be gleaned from the audited
                    accounts and monthly management reports that O&amp;O had. O&amp;O subsequently
                    made two further requests for the profit and loss statements, but these too were
                    not acceded to by Richvein. We note that HN acknowledged during
                    cross-examination that the audited accounts and monthly management reports
                    provided to O&amp;O <em>did not contain</em> the relevant
                    information that would assist in performing a cash flow analysis of
                        Richvein.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Pertinently, Bonvests also
                    acknowledged in the course of arguments in this appeal that Richvein itself had
                    not conducted any cash flow analysis or projections before the Rights Issue was
                    decided on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On 26 October 2006, the day of the Rights
                    Issue EGM itself, O&amp;O unsuccessfully requested yet again that the Rights
                    Issue EGM be postponed. The proposed resolution for the rights issue was
                    accordingly passed at the Rights Issue EGM at $0.38 per rights share (the
                    “Rights Issue”) even though JL dissented. It bears mention that no
                    response was ever given to any of his requests or queries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Pursuant to the Rights Issue, provisional
                    allotment letters were issued. The final date of acceptance was 3 November
                    2006. O&amp;O assumed that payment was to be made by a local cheque and
                    requested instead to make payment by telegraphic transfer (on 27 October
                    2006 and 30 October 2006) as it did not have a Singapore bank account from
                    which a cheque could be issued. Both these requests were denied without HN or
                    KBS ever deigning to give any explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     JL later requested for more time to pay as
                    some of the family’s funds were kept in Indonesia and certain banks and
                    businesses in Indonesia were closed for public holidays during that time. This
                    request, too, was curtly rejected. Despite this, O&amp;O somehow managed to
                    accept its provisional allotment on 3 November 2006 with the requisite
                    cheque payment drawn on a bank in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The oral agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     O&amp;O commenced the action in the court
                    below seeking relief under s 216 of the Companies Act. It alleged that the
                    Related Party Transactions, the Share Transfer and the Rights Issue, whether
                    taken alone or cumulatively, were oppressive and/or unfairly
                prejudicial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     O&amp;O further argued that Richvein was a
                    quasi-partnership by virtue of an alleged oral agreement (the “Oral
                    Agreement”) entered into by O&amp;O and Unicurrent in or around 1979. The
                    Oral Agreement was allegedly the culmination of various discussions between the
                    two families, the primary (and disputed) terms of which were laid out by O&amp;O
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Lauw family was to be consulted
                        on all important decisions and would be informed of the development and
                        performance of Richvein’s business (the “Important Decision
                        Term”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     Richvein would eventually be listed on The Stock Exchange of Singapore
                        through an initial public offering (the “Listing Term”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     if either
                        party wished to sell its shares, it would have to offer the shares to the
                        other party first. In order to realise their investment, both parties
                        envisaged the possibility of a mutual exit strategy by selling their
                        respective shares individually after the successful public listing of
                        Richvein’s shares or by selling their stakes together to interested
                        buyers (the “Exit Term”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     According to O&amp;O, as Richvein was a
                    quasi-partnership by reason of the Oral Agreement, it was entitled to expect
                    from Bonvests a “high standard of corporate governance” (<em>Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and
                        others</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at [83] (“<em>Borden</em>”)). O&amp;O also contended that by being
                    the majority party in a quasi-partnership arrangement, Bonvests should
                    “take a broader and more generous view of their obligations”
                        (<em>Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2006] 3 SLR(R) 827 (“<em>Evenstar</em>”) at [45]) to O&amp;O, the minority
                faction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Judge was of the view that the common
                    thread between the four alternative limbs of relief under s 216 of the
                    Companies Act was some element of <em>unfairness</em> that
                    would justify the invocation of the court’s jurisdiction. Additionally,
                    the Judge held that while prejudice was an important factor in the overall
                    assessment of an action under s 216, it was not an essential
                    requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     While O&amp;O might have viewed the
                    alternative of the back-door approach as a threat, the Judge thought that it had
                    to take a stand nonetheless. It was not disputed that O&amp;O had negotiated for
                    the removal of the pre-emption rights which Bonvests agreed to and subsequently
                    implemented. Having consented to the Share Transfer and obtained the removal of
                    the pre-emption rights for its benefit, it was not open to O&amp;O to later
                    complain about the Share Transfer or how the Share Transfer made it less likely
                    for Richvein to be listed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     HN and Bonvests had not, in the Judge’s
                    view, acted unfairly in respect of the Rights Issue. HN could not be faulted for
                    looking into the question of refinancing the 2002 Loan one year before it
                    was due for payment. The availability of other means of repayment did not make
                    the Rights Issue unfair. The Rights Issue had been decided upon because of
                    JL’s own intransigence. There was no suggestion by O&amp;O that the price
                    of $0.38 per share was unjustifiable. O&amp;O had Richvein’s audited
                    accounts and monthly management accounts and JL was unable to elaborate more
                    specifically as to what kind of additional information he had been seeking.
                    Further, the Judge held that the one month taken to conduct the Rights Issue
                    (and the eight days given to subscribe for the rights shares) was not unduly
                    short, since O&amp;O had been given adequate notice of the Rights Issue EGM,
                    JL’s dissent notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Judge acknowledged that HN <em>could</em> have given instructions to accept payment by
                    telegraphic transfer or to extend the time for subscription but accepted that
                    the background circumstances must have been frustrating for him. In any case,
                    although O&amp;O did not have a bank account in Singapore, it managed to
                    subscribe for its portion of the rights shares on time. In so far as O&amp;O
                    said it did not have available funds in Singapore to subscribe and needed more
                    time, it had already known for some time <em>before</em>
                    the Rights Issue EGM that HN was pushing ahead with the Rights Issue.
                    Accordingly, the Judge held that there had been no prejudice to
                O&amp;O.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Judge further determined that the three
                    Related Party Transactions were not unfair. O&amp;O did not give any evidence to
                    show how HN was in breach of s 156(4) of the Companies Act by virtue of the
                    fact that his interests in the related companies were different in nature or
                    greater in extent from the date of the latest applicable disclosure notice to
                    the time the transactions were entered into. Additionally, the Judge found that
                    mere non-compliance with Article 92 would not necessarily warrant a finding
                    of oppression. JL knew or ought to have known of HN’s interests in the
                    three companies. At the very least, JL had known that Richvein had been
                    contracting with businesses related to HN or Bonvests. Having earlier agreed to
                    the three-tier arrangement, O&amp;O could not subsequently complain that HIHR
                    had no employees or that a large portion of the management fee paid by Richvein
                    to HIHR would be subsequently redirected to Bonvests. Plainly, HS had become
                    redundant on the resignation of its two key employees and its removal saved
                    compliance costs. It did not result in HIHR receiving more from Richvein than
                    what it had received from HS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Even considering the Share Transfer, the
                    Rights Issue and the Related Party Transactions cumulatively, the Judge found
                    that there had been no unfairness visited upon O&amp;O for the purposes of
                    s 216 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     With respect to the Oral Agreement, the Judge
                    found that O&amp;O had failed to establish the existence of the Listing Term and
                    the Exit Term. He also held that whilst there might have been an understanding
                    as between the parties with respect to important decisions concerning Richvein
                    (the Important Decision Term), such an understanding was of an informal nature
                    at best. Accordingly, the Judge held that it was unnecessary for him to find
                    whether there existed a quasi-partnership between O&amp;O and Bonvests with
                    respect to Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">This appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On appeal, O&amp;O contends that the Judge had
                    erred in studying the facts as three distinct and separate episodes. According
                    to counsel for O&amp;O, Mr Sundaresh Menon SC
                    (“Mr Menon”), it was not seeking to reverse the individual
                    transactions complained of. Rather, its central complaint was that the <em>manner</em> in which these transactions were carried out
                    manifested a rapidly deteriorating relationship in which Bonvests’
                    response to every request by O&amp;O was driven by indifference at best, and
                    malice at worst. From O&amp;O’s perspective, this decaying relationship
                    was one that required relief from the court, given the propensity of the
                    majority shareholder to abuse its power in oppressing the
                minority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Menon also argued that the Judge had
                    made a mistake by failing to consider whether Richvein was a quasi-partnership.
                    It was O&amp;O’s case on appeal that “the failure to make a finding
                    on this issue led to several other errors”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>,
                    including the dismissal of the Important Decision Term and the fact that the
                    Rights Issue was, <em>inter alia</em>, also a violation of
                    legitimate expectations between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It was further submitted by Mr Menon that
                    quite apart from the question of the mistrust that had taken root as a result of
                    HN’s dictatorial governance, characterised by the oppressive conduct of
                    Richvein’s affairs, s 216 relief was nonetheless appropriate given
                    that Bonvests had chosen to issue new shares for an improper purpose, <em>viz</em>. the dilution of O&amp;O’s shareholding in
                    Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In response, Mr Yeo’s arguments
                    centred on the contention that O&amp;O’s case on appeal had departed very
                    starkly from its pleaded case. From Bonvests’ point of view,
                    O&amp;O’s pleaded case had been premised solely on the Oral Agreement and
                    Bonvests’ resulting breaches of the Exit Term, Listing Term and the
                    Important Decision Term. By seeking to rely on a sweeping assertion that there
                    was an agreement of co-participation between the parties, Mr Yeo contended
                    that O&amp;O was fielding arguments on appeal that were entirely different from
                    those that had been canvassed before the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is appropriate for us to note at this
                    juncture that while the evidence before us on appeal remains as it was in the
                    court below, all the <em>material</em> findings of fact by
                    the Judge came by way of deduction or inference. As such, this court is not
                    constrained from reviewing his findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on minority oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Judge has helpfully summarised the law on
                    this area (at [51]–[76] of the GD). We see no point in rehearsing his
                    overview and shall therefore confine ourselves to a brief outline of the
                    principles immediately relevant to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Single act” and “continuing conduct”
                oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Section 216(1) of the Companies Act
                    provides the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    that the affairs
                                of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors

                                members or holders of debentures including himself or in disregard
                                of his or their interests as members, shareholders or holders of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As pointed out by the Judge at [52] of the GD,
                    s 216 appears to provide four alternative limbs under which relief may be
                    granted – oppression, disregard of a member’s interest, unfair
                    discrimination or otherwise prejudicial conduct. These four limbs are not to be
                    read disjunctively. The common thread underpinning the entire section is the
                    element of unfairness. The instructive observations of Buckley LJ in the
                    English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Re Jermyn Street Turkish
                        Baths Ltd</em> [1971] 3 All ER 184 at 199 are apt for the
                    purposes of this appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our judgment, oppression occurs when shareholders, having a dominant
                        power in a company, either (1) exercise that power to procure that

                        or (2) procure by an express or implicit threat of an exercise of that

                        affairs; and when such conduct is <em>unfair</em>
                        … to the other members of the company or some of them, and lacks that
                        degree of probity which they are entitled to expect in the conduct of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">………….. any exercise in further defining or
                        refining each of the expressions ‘oppression’, ‘disregard
                        of interests’, ‘unfair discrimination’ or
                        prejudice’, in order to ascertain any differences in their meaning and
                        application looks to be a frustrating one. It would be futile, if not
                        impossible, to split pedantic hairs over the precise and exact meaning of
                        the medley phraseology favoured by the legal draughtsman. The fruit of such
                        labour could only add uncertainty and confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The expressions in the Singapore, Malaysian, UK and Australian provisions
                        — ‘oppression,’ ‘disregard of interests’ (or
                        ‘contrary to interests’), ‘unfair discrimination’
                        and ‘prejudice’ (or ‘unfair prejudice’) — all
                        point toward behaviour on the part of the majority shareholders or the
                        controllers of a company that departs from the standards of fair play
                        amongst commercial parties. Traditionally, such behaviour would have
                        attracted the dyslogistic labels of unfair, improper, unjust or inequitable.
                        Other unflattering labels have included the lukewarm tag of
                        ‘reprehensible’ to the fiery rebuke of ‘tyrannical’.
                        It is such opprobrious behaviour, it is submitted, that the legal
                        draughtsmen of section 216 of the Companies Act and its foreign
                        equivalents, sought to impugn. Therefore, <em>rather than
                            distinguishing one ground from the other in section 216, the four
                            grounds set out therein ought to be looked at as a compound one, the
                            purpose of which is to identify conduct which offends the standards of
                            commercial fairness and is deserving of intervention by the
                            courts</em>. To this end, the combined language of
                        section 216 is suggestive, descriptive and evocative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 216 of the Companies Act was conceived and passed with the
                        objective of protecting minority shareholders from majority abuse. In order
                        to offer effective and comprehensive protection, section 216 confers on
                        the courts a flexible jurisdiction to do justice and to address unfairness
                        and inequity in corporate affairs. … The discretionary power of the
                        courts under section 216 is notoriously wide. Thus, in determining the
                        scope of section 216, <em>rather than deciphering the precise
                            nuance of each of the expressions ‘oppression,’
                            ‘disregard of interests,’ ‘unfair
                            discrimination’ and ‘prejudice,’ a compendious
                            interpretative approach, with an emphasis on the rationale and purpose
                            of section 216, is hereby advocated</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Here, we must pause to say that we also agree
                    with the Judge’s conclusion at [76] of the GD that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the common thread under s 216 is some element of unfairness.
                            <em>In my view, prejudice is a factor, and perhaps, a
                            very important one in the overall assessment, but I do not think that it
                            is an essential requirement</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Breaking down s 216(1) into its
                    constituent parts, it is obvious that it provides for minority protection
                    where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     the company’s affairs are
                        conducted or the directors’ powers are exercised</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_73-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       in an oppressive manner to
                            the member; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_73-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       in disregard of the member’s
                            interests;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     or an act is done or threatened or a members’ resolution is
                        passed or proposed which:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_73-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       unfairly discriminates
                            against one or more members; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_73-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       is otherwise prejudicial to one or more
                            members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Based on a plain reading of s 216(1) itself,
                    therefore, it appears that either a course of conduct or even a <em>single act</em> could theoretically amount to oppression. It
                    has been noted, however, that the majority of the cases that have been decided
                    by the courts pertain to minority complaints under limb (a) above,
                        <em>viz</em>, oppression manifesting itself in the
                    extended abuse in the conduct of the company’s affairs (see Victor Yeo and
                    Joyce Lee, <em>Commercial Applications of Company Law in
                        Singapore</em> (CCH Asia Pte Ltd, 3rd Ed, 2008) at p 282.
                    Nonetheless, the following passage from <em>Minority
                        Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</em> correctly encapsulates
                    the position on what might be said to single distinct acts of unfair behaviour
                    (at pp 228–229):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is recognised, however, that a past oppressive act,
                        although remedied, may belie a risk of future oppressive acts and may have
                        continuing oppressive effects. Therefore, the fact that an excluded director
                        has been reinstated or that a diversion of monies has been repaid may not
                        mean oppression of the minority has necessarily ceased. In <em>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</em>, though improper
                        loans made by the controllers of the company to themselves had been repaid,
                        Lord Wilberforce acknowledged that the transactions could have remained
                        material as evidence of oppressive conduct and made the following
                        observation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A last minute correction by the majority may well leave open a finding
                            that, as shown by its conduct over a period, a firm tendency or
                            propensity still exists at the time of the proceedings to oppress the
                            minority or to disregard its interests so calling for a remedy under the
                            section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the same vein, <em>an isolated act may
                            amount to oppression and a course of conduct need not be
                            shown</em>. For example, <em>a singular dilution of
                            the minority’s shares by the majority contrary to an informal
                            understanding</em>, or a clear and egregious misappropriation of
                        monies contrary to an implied understanding, would suffice as oppressive
                        conduct. However, a singular assertion of excessive remuneration or
                        inadequate dividend payment perhaps may not. As illustrated by cases like
                            <em>Low Peng Boon v Low Janie</em>, <em>Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd</em>, <em>Re Elgindata Ltd</em> and <em>Re Cumana
                            Ltd</em>, to name a few, allegations of oppression appear to be
                        best sustained where oppression manifests itself in a course of conduct over
                        a period of time, straddling several grounds or categories of oppressive
                        conduct, and considered cumulatively. Nonetheless, this is not to say that a
                        past and singular act may not amount to oppression under section 216 of
                        the Companies Act. In the words of Derrington J in <em>Re Norvabron Pty Ltd (No 2)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Obviously, in order to invoke the exercise of the court’s
                            discretion, the single past act would need to be so serious as to equate
                            a continuing present state of affairs, but a series of past acts may be
                            cumulative and may be considered in respect of their present and future
                            effect. <em>A single act in the past may not be so
                                serious as to support the remedy or having been corrected may not
                                support it</em> …
                            <em>but of course everything depends upon the
                                circumstances of the particular case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In the case of <em>Re Cumana
                        Ltd</em> [1986] BCLC 430, the majority shareholder, Bolton, prevailed
                    upon the company to undertake a rights issue. Bolton knew that Lewis, the
                    minority shareholder, was unlikely to take up his proportion of new shares since
                    he was unemployed and financially challenged. The effect of the proposed rights
                    issue, should Lewis have been unable to take up the shares, would have been to
                    reduce Lewis’ minority holding from one-third to less than 1%. Lewis
                    brought an action under the precursor to s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985
                    asserting, <em>inter alia</em>, that the rights issue was
                    unfairly prejudicial to him. The judge at first instance inferred that the
                    proposed rights issue was part of a scheme to reduce Lewis’s shareholding
                    in the company and held that it was unfairly prejudicial to Lewis’s
                    interests. This was affirmed by the English Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     This is not to say that every issue of shares
                    with knowledge that a minority shareholder may not take up the issue due to
                    impecuniosity may amount to a case of oppression or unfair prejudice (<em>a fortiori</em> the case here for O&amp;O, which was
                    perfectly capable of subscribing to the rights issue). In <em>Re
                        a Company (No 007623 of 1984</em>) [1986] BCLC 362, Hoffmann J
                    dismissed, <em>inter alia</em>, the minority
                    shareholder’s assertion that a rights issue he was not able to take up was
                    unfairly prejudicial conduct on the part of the majority shareholders. With his
                    customary acuity, he pointed out the following (at 366–367):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The other matter relied on as unfair conduct is the proposed rights issue.
                        It was said that the company had no need of additional capital and the
                        purpose of the issue was merely to bring about a drastic dilution of the
                        petitioner’s interest in the company. I find that the board genuinely
                        believed that the company required additional capital. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, I do not think that the bona fides of the decision or the
                        fact that the petitioner was offered shares on the same terms as other
                        shareholders necessarily means that the rights issue could not have been
                        unfairly prejudicial to his interests. If the majority know that the
                        petitioner does not have the money to take up his rights and the offer is
                        made at par when the shares are plainly worth a great deal more than par as
                        part of a majority holding (but very little as a minority holding), it seems
                        to me arguable that carrying through the transaction in that form could,
                        viewed objectively, constitute unfairly prejudicial conduct. In this case,
                        however, it seems to me that the petitioner, if he lacks the resources or
                        inclination to contribute <em>pari passu</em> to the
                        company, could protect his interests by offering to sell his existing
                        holding to the majority. Indeed, if the company needs funds and he does not
                        want to pay his share, it seems to me only fair that he should offer to sell
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Minority Shareholders’ Rights and
                        Remedies</em>, Margaret Chew suggests at p 199 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... on the whole, the fact that the majority shareholders have procured an
                        issue of shares by the company with the intention of diluting a minority
                        shareholder’s proportional shareholding will not amount to oppressive
                        conduct. Generally, a shareholder participates in a company without the
                        expectation that the shareholding ratios amongst shareholders would remain
                        static and unchangeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Re Cumana Ltd</em>, however, the facts had
                    a distinctive feature: there had been an informal understanding amounting to a
                    legitimate expectation that the proportion of shareholdings would remain
                    immutable, to reflect the distribution of the company’s commercial profit.
                    As we shall see shortly in the next sub-section, it was O&amp;O’s case
                    below that there had been a similar informal understanding between O&amp;O and
                    Bonvests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     With respect to the four limbs of injustice to
                    minorities countenanced in s 216 – (a) oppression,
                    (b) disregard of a member’s interest constituting “continuing
                    conduct” injustice, (c) unfair discrimination and (d) prejudice
                    falling under the purview of “single act” injustice – the
                    Judge’s conclusion (at [68] of the GD) that “there is no meaningful
                    distinction between all four limbs” is broadly correct. Accepting that
                    “the common thread [under s 216] is some element of unfairness which
                    would justify the invocation of the court’s jurisdiction under
                    s 216” means that the appropriate “test” to apply in
                    cases of “single-act” injustice would accordingly be the same as
                    the test already applied in cases of “continuing conduct”
                    injustice, <em>viz</em>, “a visible departure from
                    the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play
                    which a shareholder is entitled to expect”: <em>Re Kong

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Quasi-partnerships</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Distinctly, another principle that should be
                    remembered (given our present facts) is that courts, in deciding whether to
                    grant relief under s 216 of the Companies Act, must take into account both
                    the legal rights and the legitimate expectations of members. While these legal
                    rights and expectations are usually enshrined in the company’s
                    constitution in the majority of cases, a special class of quasi-partnership
                    companies form an exception to this rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In <em>Ebrahimi v Westbourne
                        Galleries Ltd and Others</em> [1973] AC 360 (“<em>Ebrahimi</em>”), a case dealing with the court’s
                    jurisdiction to wind up companies on “just and equitable grounds”,
                    the House of Lords recognised that shareholders may have enforceable
                    expectations which do not emanate from any articles of association and which are
                    not necessarily submerged in the company’s structure.
                    Lord Wilberforce said, at 379:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] limited company is more than a mere legal entity, with a personality
                        in law of its own: <em>… there is room in company law
                            for recognition of the fact that behind it, or amongst it, there are
                            individuals, with rights, expectations and obligations inter se which
                            are not necessarily submerged in the company structure</em>.
                        … The “just and equitable” provisions … enable
                        the court to subject the exercise of legal rights to equitable
                        considerations; considerations, that is, of a personal character arising
                        between one individual and another, which may make it unjust, or
                        inequitable, to insist on legal rights, or to exercise them in a particular
                        way. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Although <em>Ebrahimi</em> was decided in the context of the “just and
                    equitable” jurisdiction of the court under the winding up provisions of
                    the UK Companies Act, there is little doubt that under both English and
                    Singapore law, the doctrine of quasi-partnerships is equally applicable to cases
                    involving minority oppression. Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Borden</em> emphatically pointed out at [80] and [83] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    The law on acts that are considered oppressive to a
                            minority shareholder or in disregard of his interests is settled.

                            affairs of companies (see for example <em>Re Tri-Circle Investment Pte Ltd</em> [[1993]
                            1 SLR(R) 441]) on the ground that a minority shareholder
                            participates in a corporate entity knowing that decisions are subject to
                            majority rule, s 216 of [the Companies Act] enjoins them to examine
                            the conduct of majority shareholders to determine whether they have
                            departed from the proper standard of commercial fairness and the
                            standards of fair dealing and conditions of fair play: <em>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</em> [1978]

                    laid out in <em>Re Kong Thai Sawmill</em> at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above. However, whether the majority’s
                    conduct may be characterised as unfair is, to be sure, a multifaceted inquiry.
                    Chan CJ additionally observed in <em>Evenstar</em>, at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hence, it is our view that the “just and equitable” and

                        own respective spheres of application. However, at the same time, we also
                        recognise that these two jurisdictions, though distinct, do in fact overlap

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In the context of quasi-partnerships,
                    therefore, the courts have consistently applied a stricter yardstick of scrutiny
                    because of the peculiar vulnerability of minority shareholders in such
                    companies. First, those who enter into a corporate structure often do not always
                    spell out their rights and obligations in their entirety, in part because they
                    are unable to anticipate all the eventualities that may arise, but also because
                    it would be disproportionately expensive and time-consuming to do so even if
                    they could. Naturally, this problem is particularly acute in respect of those
                    who set up business with others essentially on the basis of mutual trust and
                    confidence – they would have operated on the belief that the majority
                    would take their interests into account and that any such problems would be
                    readily and civilly ironed out. Ironically, often these understandings are not
                    documented, let alone spelt out in legal terms, as it might be perceived that
                    the very documentation of the understanding might betray a lack of trust. This
                    might seem naïve but unfortunately this behaviour is not infrequent, even today,
                    in commercial dealings; relationships thin in words but thick in trust
                    underpinned by the implicit belief that each will do right by the other without
                    the need to spell out in embarrassing detail what is expected or needed. Second,
                    the reality of the nature of a closed company makes it susceptible to
                    exploitative conduct by the majority simply because the minority has no obvious
                    legal remedies spelt out in the memorandum and articles of association. At the
                    risk of stating the obvious, it bears mention that minority shares in private
                    companies are often difficult to dispose of, and even if there was a market for
                    them they would often have to be sold at a substantial discount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Consistent with the above concerns, it is
                    well-established that informal understandings and assumptions may be taken into
                    account in determining whether the minority has been unfairly treated. Hoffman
                    LJ insightfully summed up the position in <em>Re Saul D Harrison
                        &amp; Sons plc</em> [1995] 1 BCLC 14 (“<em>Harrison</em>”) when he stated, at 19–20:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus the personal relationship between a shareholder and those who control
                        the company may entitle him to say that it would in certain circumstances be
                        unfair for them to exercise a power conferred by the articles upon the board
                        or the company in general meeting. I have in the past ventured to borrow
                        from public law the term ‘legitimate expectation’ to describe
                        the correlative ‘right’ in the shareholder to which such a
                        relationship may give rise. <em>It often arises out of a
                            fundamental understanding between the shareholders which formed the
                            basis of their association but was not put into contractual
                            form</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The inquiry as to the equities of the
                    situation ultimately calls for a textured approach, rather than a technical one
                    that is concerned only with the strict rights of parties. <em>Thus, a majority shareholder may be within his strict legal rights but the
                        manner in which he exploits his legal rights may call for the court’s
                        intervention. In particular, it is trite law that conduct can be unfair
                        without even being unlawful</em>. On the other hand, there appears to
                    be something to be said against the post-hoc judicial imposition of a
                    quasi-partnership where the parties concerned are savvy, experienced investors
                    – like JL and HN here – who have chosen the vehicle of a
                    joint-venture company for a specific and capital-intensive purpose, see
                        <em>eg</em>, the recent Malaysian case of <em>Dato Ting Check Sii v Datuk Haji Mohamad Tufail bin Mahmud &amp;
                        Anor</em> [2007] 7 MLJ 618 (“<em>Ting Check
                        Sii</em>”) at [15]. In cases of this nature, the facts must
                    clearly point towards an understanding that the parties would have to jointly
                    make important decisions and that the substratum of trust had broken down
                    because of the defendant’s unfair conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was Richvein conceived as a quasi-partnership?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     First, we ought to dispose of a side issue. We
                    readily agree with the Judge’s finding at [85] of the GD that O&amp;O had
                    failed to establish the existence of the Listing Term and the Exit Term. There
                    was nothing on the evidence which pointed to any concrete basis for these two
                    alleged terms in the Oral Agreement. O&amp;O were obviously tilting at windmills
                    in order to prop up their legal position. We need say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     On the other hand, we entertain serious
                    reservations about the Judge’s consideration of the relevance and
                    significance of the Important Decision Term. At [85] of the GD the Judge
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accepted that there might have been some understanding as between the
                        parties with respect to important decisions, but such an understanding was
                        of an informal nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was, with respect, a curious finding. What more could be required
                    of the Important Decision Term, as alleged by O&amp;O, than <em>precisely</em> an understanding of an “informal nature”
                    with respect to important decisions? An understanding of a “formal
                    nature”, necessarily, would mean that there would be precise contractual
                    terms; and had that been the case, this would have been a straightforward matter
                    making it quite unnecessary for any inquiry into the existence and
                    characteristics of “quasi-partnerships”. If the Judge, on the
                    other hand, meant that because the understanding was of an informal nature it
                    did not merit legal protection, we must respectfully disagree. The real issue he
                    ought to have addressed was whether there was any understanding and if so, its
                    precise purport. It is not necessary that the understanding be legally
                    enforceable. What is crucial, we reiterate, is the kernel of the understanding.
                    In this regard, Bonvests’ argument at [66] appears to be misguided; by
                    virtue of having pleaded the existence of the Important Decision Term, the
                    “agreement of co-participation between the parties”
                    <em>had</em> effectively already been pleaded by O&amp;O.
                    The Judge had, in our view, erred in adopting Bonvests’ position, and in
                    focusing on the legal formalities of the understanding rather than on its
                        <em>substance</em> and <em>objectives</em>. We now turn to examine the substance of the
                    understanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It appears quite plain to us that the
                    circumstances under which Richvein was incorporated suggest that it was founded
                    upon a relationship of mutual trust and confidence between the Lauw and
                    Sianandar families. For instance, in a letter from JL to HN dated 7 October
                    2006 addressing JL’s reluctance to provide a personal guarantee for the
                    refinancing package, JL stated the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am much displeased that you have questioned my decision not to provide
                        the personal bank guarantee for the refinancing of the Loan. It is also
                        especially so when you made the statement that “we should separate
                        corporate and personal issues and not let this affect the smooth running of
                        the business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>May I take you back to the 1970’s and 1980 when
                            you and I started this venture. As far as I distinctly recall, we were
                            partners, ready and willing to put in our own efforts and cash to start
                            the hotel business</em>. You had your own company to front your
                        investment. I had mine. You agreed to be majority and I minority. <em>There was no issue not being able to work or co-operate with
                            one another. There was no necessity even for me to insist on minority
                            right as against the majority. It was simply “you and I”
                            on this business venture</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When you wish to transfer your 70% to Bonvest[s] Holdings Ltd, a public
                        company, I didn’t object. <em>It was within our
                            personal understanding that I should not pose problems to your personal
                            intentions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However when, you decide to take out your personal guarantee to the bank,
                        you left me the personal sole guarantor potentially exposed. Your acts
                        benefited yourself personally and you failed to think of me. <em>Therefore when I recalled the time when we were as friends and
                            on good faith started this business, it pains me greatly that you did
                            not even take me into consideration</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do not agree that we can entirely separate the corporate from
                        the personal issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Such an “understanding” would be consistent with a
                    finding of Richvein being a quasi-partnership company, at least during the
                    formative years of its inception. In this respect the relationship between the
                    Lauws and the Sianandars bears more than a passing semblance to that which
                    existed in the Australian case of <em>Wallington v Kokotovich
                        Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [1993] 11 ACLC 1207 (“<em>Kokotovich</em>”) where the court found a
                    “moral partnership” between Mrs Wallington and
                    Mr Kokotovich. Prior to the breakdown of friendly relations in <em>Kokotovich</em>, Mrs Wallington and Mr Kokotovich
                    had enjoyed an “intimate … relationship” that led to
                    “both an emotional and a business association”
                    <em>vis-à-vis</em> their jointly held company. The nature
                    of the joint shareholding between the two parties was, however, unclear. While
                    Mr Kokotovich thought that Mrs Wallington only held shares “so
                    as to satisfy legal requirements”, Mrs Wallington herself laboured
                    under no such impression. In the event, when Mr Kokotovich issued
                    additional shares to himself and members of his family, Young J held that
                    the objective of the share issue was to reduce Mrs Wallington’s
                    ownership interest in the company and that this was oppressive. On appeal, the
                    Supreme Court of New South Wales affirmed Young J’s decision, stating
                    the following (<em>Kokotovich Constructions Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v
                        Wallington</em> (1995) 13 ACLC 1113 at p 1126):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was submitted by the appellants that it would be “illogical and
                        absurd” for the governing director [Mr Kokotovich] to have the
                        wide array of powers that he has, but not to have the power to vote on a
                        resolution at an ordinary meeting. I do not agree. These provisions, in
                        fact, reflect the view of the nature of the company for which the respondent
                        argued, and which Young J accepted. <em>Mr Kokotovich was to have the control of the day-to-day operations
                            of the company. He was to manage the company. This was never disputed by
                            the respondent. However, when it came to specific issues about the
                            constitution of the company, issues that the general meeting of
                            shareholders would address, Mrs Wallington and Mr Kokotovich
                            were to have equal voices. This reflects the significant role which both
                            incorporators intended Mrs Wallington to have in the company. It
                            also reflects, and confirms, the “moral partnership” which
                            Young J found to exist</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As in the case in <em>Kokotovich</em>, it is striking how much trust the Lauws and
                    Sianandars reposed, in the course of the negotiations over the joint venture, on
                    mutual good faith. HN himself acknowledged that although there were a number of
                    meetings between members of the two families to discuss the terms of the
                    proposed joint venture, <em>none</em> of the terms agreed
                    upon during the discussions were reduced to writing. He testified as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We had a few meetings and discussions but I cannot now recall the exact
                        number or the dates on which they took place. As far as I can recall, the
                        discussions were fairly brief and <em>the main focus was how
                            to accommodate the parties’ respective interests</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The brevity and informality of the
                    parties’ negotiations is highly significant, given the large financial
                    commitment involved in the joint venture. LSL, DS and HN owned several other
                    companies at the time and could properly be considered experienced investors and
                    businessmen. This failure to record essential terms of their agreement in
                    writing can only be rationalised and explained on the basis that the Lauw and
                    Sianandar families had consciously chosen to enter into a relationship
                    implicitly based on mutual trust and good faith with respect to the conduct of
                    the affairs of Richvein in the future. Indeed, apart from a bare statement by HN
                    that “LSL, JL, DS and I were not close friends … [t]he investment
                    was for business purposes and our relationship was purely
                        commercial”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, it should be noted that the <em>basis</em> of JL’s letter excerpted at <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above was never expressly denied or refuted by HN. This was
                    despite it being <em>HN</em> who had “demand[ed]
                    that [JL] let [him] know in writing what Bonvests and/or [HN] had done to cause
                    [JL] to be so unhappy with [them]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In this
                    connection, the observations of Lady Justice Arden in the recent English case of

                        (“<em>Strahan</em>”) at [19] and [23] are
                    pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    The question whether the relationship between
                            shareholders constitutes a "quasi-partnership” is relatively easy
                            to answer if the company's business was previously run by a partnership
                            in which the shareholders were the partners. It is indeed common for
                            partnerships to be converted into companies for tax or other reasons.
                                <em>It is also relatively easy to establish whether a

                                concept which they have. …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>…</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    … [Additionally,] the terms of the option

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It was unsurprising, therefore, that HN had no
                    alternative but to accept during cross-examination that a number of <em>oral</em> agreements on highly significant issues were
                    reached during these preliminary discussions. These issues included the
                    representation of the Lauw and Sianandar families on Richvein’s board of
                    directors, the funding of the building project, the apportionment of profits and
                    losses as well as the management and operations of Richvein. Taken together,
                    these agreements exhibited a <em>fundamental
                        understanding</em> between the two families as to the manner in which
                    the business of Richvein would be conducted, an understanding not unlike that
                    which prevailed in <em>Harrison</em> at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     HN further acknowledged in the course of
                    cross-examination that there had been an obligation to consult the Lauw family
                    on important financial and operational matters. Indeed, the following excerpt
                    was probably the basis upon which the Judge concluded at [85] of the GD that
                    there was indeed “some understanding as between the parties with respect
                    to important decisions”. It will be helpful if we make reference to
                    HN’s responses when cross-examined on this issue:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Strahan</em>, the English Court of Appeal
                    similarly regarded Mr Strahan’s “participat[ion] in management
                    decisions of the company” as indicative that his relationship with the
                    only other shareholder, Mr Wilcock, “was more a
                    ‘quasi-partnership’ relationship than a [mere] relationship between
                    a majority shareholder and a company executive” holding a minority share
                    in the company (at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     We are, however, unimpressed by
                    Mr Menon’s submissions that the existence of “restricted exit
                    options” indicates a greater likelihood of Richvein being <em>ab initio</em> a quasi-partnership<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Pre-emption rights with respect to
                    share transfers, like those enshrined in Article 30 of Richvein’s
                    Articles of Association, are a common feature of many modern company articles
                    and/or shareholder agreements, and on their own do not carry much weight in
                    establishing the existence of any quasi-partnership. Article
                        30 provides<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shares may be freely transferred by a member or other person entitled to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The relative ubiquity and uniformity of
                    pre-emption clauses in present day company articles militate against any
                    argument that special consideration must be given to such
                    “transformational” provisions. Indeed, <em>pace</em> O&amp;O’s position that “a restriction on the
                    free transfer of the company’s shares” is indicative of a
                    quasi-partnership, Tan Cheng Han SC (gen ed), <em>Walter
                        Woon on Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2005)
                    states at para 11.111 that,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[i]n the case of a private company, the transfer of
                            shares must be restricted in some way</em>. This is commonly done
                        by giving a discretion to directors to refuse to register a transfer, or by
                        stipulating to whom shares may be transferred, or <em>by
                            giving to the existing members a right to have any shares offered to
                            them first before they can be transferred (‘pre-emptive
                            rights’)</em>. emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To say, therefore, as O&amp;O does that “a restriction on the
                    free transfer of the company’s shares” is indicative of a
                    quasi-partnership is surely to wag the dog with its tail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In any case, as has already been mentioned, on
                    23 September 2002 O&amp;O’s solicitors wrote to HN, seeking the
                    amendment of Article 30 such that all pre-emption rights would be removed.
                    It was therefore O&amp;O that had wanted and effectively procured the removal of
                    Article 30. Given this, it is difficult to see how O&amp;O also then goes
                    on to say that “[t]he fact that Article 30 was subsequently amended
                    as a result of certain actions pursued by [HN] in relation to the Share Transfer
                    … does not detract from the original founding intention behind the joint
                        venture.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> It appears to us that the existence
                    and subsequent removal of Article 30 is no more than a legal red herring
                    that adds little in any effort to characterise the true relationship of the
                    parties. Article 30 was not intentionally inserted to signify the special
                    relationship between the parties. Likewise, its removal must also be understood
                    contextually. It was prompted by a move from HN to include a new entity, a
                    publicly listed entity, into the original relationship which was strictly
                    between two families. JL had asked for its removal to achieve theoretical parity
                    with HN, who had made it clear that one way or another the shares would be
                    transferred to Bonvests. We use the term “theoretical parity”
                    because the Lauw family’s minority interest could not in reality be
                    transferred to a third party without a very substantial discount. HN was clearly
                    cognisant of this: when asked if he would purchase O&amp;O’s shares in
                    Richvein, he made a paltry offer of $12.7m (see above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The originally warm relations between the Lauw
                    and Sianandar families became at best “neutral” – to borrow
                    the term employed by counsel during the course of the appeal – between
                    1991 (the year in which the difficulty with respect to HIHR arose) and 2002 (the
                    year in which HN transferred Unicurrent’s shares in Richvein to Bonvests
                    and attempted to liquidate HS to pave the way for a direct contract with HIHR).
                    Indeed, we can trace the pathology of the breakdown from the increasingly terse
                    and confrontational correspondence exchanged by the parties over the years. From
                    the tenor of the personal letters JL wrote in August 1991 just as the first
                    strains in the relationship appeared (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>), to O&amp;O’s solicitors’ letters stating its
                    dissatisfaction with the proposed liquidation of HS in February 2003, it is
                    obvious that the relationship had gradually eroded then corroded and eventually
                    unravelled irretrievably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Given the above and in particular the
                    existence of the Important Decision Term, we accept that Richvein <em>must</em> have started life as a quasi-partnership in 1980,
                    an “association founded and intended to be continued on the basis of a
                    personal relationship of mutual trust and confidence” (<em>Phoenix Office Supplies Ltd v Larvin</em> [2003] BCC 11
                        (“<em>Larvin</em>”) at [39]). In
                        <em>Larvin</em>, the English Court of Appeal held that
                    the existence of a common understanding between the only three shareholders of a
                    company indicated the presence of a <em>de facto</em>
                    quasi-partnership. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal stated as
                    follows at [40]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This relationship [between the three shareholders] was reflected in the
                        fact that, <em>although … no legally binding agreement
                            was entered into at (or subsequent to) the meeting held on March 27,
                            1995</em> with regard to what should happen to his shareholding if
                        one of the shareholders should leave the company or retire or die, <em>the matters which were discussed and apparently agreed on that
                            occasion were intended to give form to and put flesh on their
                            relationship of mutual trust and confidence in the conduct of the
                            company’s business</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The situation in <em>Larvin</em>, therefore, was
                    not very different in substance from the one established on the evidence here.
                    The fact that the relationship between the Lauw and Sianandar families began to
                    deteriorate sometime after 1991 <em>did not change the character
                        of the original relationship</em>. Accordingly, as a result of events
                    engendered mainly by HN’s actions, there was almost certainly a rapidly
                    decaying relationship between the parties from September 2003 onwards. This
                    relationship was to be characterised by curt and eventually confrontational
                    communications about a going concern that had effectively become a listed
                    subsidiary of Bonvests, which in fact owned 70% of Richvein. This was in stark
                    contrast to what the parties must have originally envisaged and how the venture
                    had initially started off: a closely knit relationship underpinned by the
                    private ownership of the shares in Richvein. This fundamental change in the
                    character of the relationship was solely precipitated by HN when he sought to
                    maximise the benefit that the Sianandar family could realise from its investment
                    in Richvein by transferring the Unicurrent shareholdings in Richvein to
                    Bonvests, a publicly held entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Related Party Transactions constitute oppression?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Quasi-partnership or no quasi-partnership,
                    HN’s conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Related Party
                    Transactions had, without question, constituted a conscious bypassing of
                    Article 92. In 2005, HN caused Richvein to enter into a management contract
                    with a company he had an interest in without reference to the Board. Again in
                    2006, he caused Richvein to enter into contracts with companies he had an
                    interest in without Board approval: see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above.
                    However, on the evidence, there had been no harm to the shareholders; indeed,
                    there might even have been some benefit in the form of compliance cost savings
                    in not having to maintain the shell company HS. We also note that there had been
                    the requisite disclosures of HN’s interests in Colex (Singapore), IPM and
                    HIHR from as early as 1984.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In any case, the decision to contract directly
                    with HIHR appeared ultimately to have been a business decision taken with the
                    strategic interests of Richvein in mind though of course it also appears that
                    Bonvests had benefited from this exercise. In this respect, we are minded to
                    agree with the findings of the Judge summarised at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above. However, in assessing this issue in isolation, the
                    Judge did not go on to also consider whether HN’s conduct on this issue
                    manifested a proclivity by HN to abuse his majority rights at the expense of
                    O&amp;O whenever there was a collision of interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Accordingly, while we do not find that a
                    case of oppression made out on this aspect of O&amp;O’s claim, this does
                    not mean that the lack of prejudice precludes further consideration of
                    HN’s earlier conduct when it comes to assessing holistically the entire
                    manner in which the affairs of Richvein have been conducted apropos O&amp;O to
                    date of which the Related Party Transactions would form a part (see below from
                        <a href="#p1_128">[128]</a> onwards).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Share Transfer constitute oppression?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    At [87]–[89] of the GD, the Judge
                    found that the Share Transfer to be insufficient to constitute
                    oppression:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    It is undisputed that HN had told [O&amp;O] that he
                            could circumvent the pre-emption rights in Richvein’s Articles by
                            injecting Unicurrent into Bonvests sometime before 20 September
                            2002. <em>[O&amp;O] might well have viewed this as a
                                threat but it had to take a position</em>. It could have
                            asserted that this was a breach of the spirit or substance of the Exit
                            Term but it did not do so. Instead, [O&amp;O] used this opportunity to
                            negotiate for the removal of the pre-emption rights in Richvein’s
                            Articles which Bonvests agreed to and implemented. <em>As
                                [O&amp;O] consented to the Share Transfer and obtained the removal
                                of the pre-emption rights, I was of the view that it was not open to
                                [O&amp;O] to complain about the Share Transfer
                            later</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    [O&amp;O] also argued that the Share Transfer
                            rendered it less likely for Richvein to be listed as envisaged under the
                            joint venture, since the Sianandar family could realize its investment
                            in Richvein by selling its shares in Bonvests. In [O&amp;O]’s
                            view, this would result in [O&amp;O], as a minority shareholder, having
                            to deal with people whom it had not intended to work together with.
                                <em>It seemed to me that since [O&amp;O] had
                                consented to the Share Transfer and obtained the removal of the
                                pre-emption rights for its benefit, it was also not open to
                                [O&amp;O] to raise this complaint</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">89    In the circumstances, it was not open to [O&amp;O]
                            to try and raise reasons to complain several years later about the Share
                            Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    With respect, we again have some difficulty
                    with the Judge’s views on this issue. One has to first appreciate how
                    O&amp;O found itself embroiled in an impossible situation where it “had
                    to take a position” and why this was done. HN had forced JL into this
                    invidious position. It was plain to us that O&amp;O was stuck between a rock and
                    a hard place. JL was only too painfully aware that HN could have forced the
                    Share Transfer either through a direct sale of Unicurrent’s shares in
                    Richvein to Bonvests, or via the back-door approach, with Bonvests acquiring
                    Unicurrent. It is therefore puzzling why the Judge reasoned that O&amp;O
                    “could have asserted that [the back-door approach] was a breach of the
                    spirit or substance of the Exit Term but it did not do so” (at [87] of
                    the GD). The Exit Term, as the Judge had earlier rightly found, was an after
                    thought contrived for the purposes of these proceedings so it should come as no
                    surprise that this was not raised. It is not disputed that O&amp;O was unhappy
                    about the Hobson’s choice it had to make. Asserting that the back-door
                    approach was a breach of the spirit or substance of any other understanding was
                    certainly one way in which it could have made its unhappiness known. This would
                    have meant litigation, at an earlier juncture, as it was also clear that HN was
                    going to be unyielding in his desire to transfer the shareholding. Another
                    option was simply for O&amp;O to let HN know that it <em>was</em> unhappy. This O&amp;O did in ample measure, as evidenced by
                    HN’s frustrated correspondences to LSL and O&amp;O’s solicitors in
                    June and September 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The point is simply that even though O&amp;O
                    eventually <em>did</em> settle for one of the two unhappy
                    alternatives, this did not mean that it could not keep its powder keg dry.
                    Merely because a shareholder does not immediately initiate legal proceedings
                    complaining about treatment unfairly dished out to him does not mean that he is
                    always precluded from doing so subsequently, see <em>eg</em>, <em>Low Peng Boon</em> at
                    [30]–[31]. Obviously, if Unicurrent’s shares in Richvein were going
                    to be transferred whether directly or indirectly, thus <em>already</em> defeating the spirit if not the letter of
                    Article 30, it would have made no sense for JL not to similarly excuse
                    himself from that restraint so as to minimise the prejudice that he would have
                    suffered as a result of the Share Transfer. This, however, did not mean that the
                    Lauw family was a willing participant; nor does it preclude the Lauw family from
                    now asserting that it has suffered prejudice in being locked in a new business
                    relationship with a listed public company that bears no resemblance to the
                    implicit understanding the families had when Richvein was incorporated in
                    1980.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    While it is true that the Sianandar family
                    also effectively controlled Bonvests, it cannot be gainsaid that the change in
                    shareholdings precipitated a radical alteration of the parties’ existing
                    relationship. Besides the obvious breakdown in trust, Bonvests – as a
                    publicly listed company with distinct legal obligations to not just the
                    Sianandar family but to its own distinct minority shareholders – was a
                    radically different entity and legal proposition from the privately held
                    Unicurrent. The joint venture, we reiterate, was conceived as a closed,
                    two-family partnership, and this was the relationship that underpinned all
                    dealings between the parties until then. In many ways, this resembles the
                    “loss of substratum” that Margaret Chew refers to in <em>Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</em> at
                    p 205:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where it can be shown that the new or proposed business venture is not one
                        that had been contemplated or agreed upon by the parties upon incorporation,
                        this conduct on the part of the majority may amount to oppressive conduct
                        under section 216 of the Companies Act, since it effectively forces the
                        minority to participate in a corporate venture that he had not expected. His
                        monies are locked into a company with commercial objectives he never
                        considered investing in. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular, in situations of loss of substratum, there may be
                        oppressive conduct even where the majority has offered to buy the
                        minority’s shares at a valuation in accordance with the
                        company’s articles of association. This is so where the valuation in
                        accordance with the procedure stipulated in the company’s articles
                        would result in a return to the minority shareholder that would be less than
                        what he would have received were the company to have been wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    All things considered, we are of the view
                    that HN’s conduct with respect to the Share Transfer (and when seen as a
                    whole) did amount to oppression pursuant to s 216. The change in character
                    of Richvein as a company, from a private one to a semi-public one, was a
                    profound one that manifestly and irretrievably altered the easy and informal
                    relationship the parties had until HN drove a coach and fours through it. We do
                    not agree with the Judge that O&amp;O, which had merely attempted to salvage
                    some theoretical benefit from the high handed behaviour of HN, cannot now
                    complain about it; see above at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Rights Issue constitute oppression?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The Judge also found that the Rights Issue
                    had not resulted in any prejudice to O&amp;O, and that in the circumstances both
                    HN and Bonvests had not acted unfairly. An issue that took centre-stage among
                    the Judge’s considerations was the fact that JL had himself
                    “torpedoed” the refinancing package (at [103]–[104] of the
                    GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">HN had managed to get a re-financing package on better terms, ie, interest
                        being charged at a rate lower than the 2002 Loan. Yet, O&amp;O and JL did
                        not agree to provide their guarantees for 30% of the loan. In evidence from
                        JL, it was clear that the real issue was his being required to provide his
                        personal guarantee when HN did not have to provide a personal guarantee for
                        70% of the loan. Indeed, after the Share Transfer some years earlier, HN had
                        managed to get himself released as a personal guarantor but JL did not
                        succeed then… This state of affairs irked JL to the extent that he
                        was not prepared to give his personal guarantee for the re-financing
                        package.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ironically, I found that it was JL who was behaving unreasonably. DBS Bank
                        had released HN and Unicurrent from their respective guarantees because
                        Bonvests, a public listed company, had given its guarantee (for 70% of the
                        2002 Loan). JL was therefore not in a similar position as HN since [O&amp;O]
                        was a HK$2 company with its shares in Richvein being its only asset. Yet, JL
                        was adamant about not continuing to provide his personal guarantee. It
                        appeared not to matter to him what disadvantages this would entail. The
                        evidence at trial was that DBS Bank might still have extended a loan but on
                        less favourable terms to Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    We again cannot agree with the Judge’s
                    conclusion on this point. If Richvein had even mildly exerted itself it seems to
                    us that the requirement for JL’s personal guarantee would have been
                    readily dispensed with – indeed, as has already been noted at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above, this was almost a certainty given the
                    enormous size of the collateral for the 2002 Loan. This was simply a matter of
                    commercial parity, and HN as a seasoned businessperson must have known that it
                    was unlikely that DBS would stand in the way if it had been pressed in any way.
                    After all, the Hotel would have been more than ample security for the
                    outstanding loan facility. It is again striking that HN did not even begin to
                    try and persuade DBS to offer the same package (without JL’s guarantee) or
                    seek alternative funding before rushing headlong into the rights issue without
                    so much as even considering the need for a proper cash flow study, see above
                    from <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> to <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Judge then went on to examine the
                    proportionality of the Rights Issue as a response to O&amp;O’s
                    intransigence with respect to the refinancing package (at [107]–[108] of
                    the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In any event, the crux of the matter was not whether
                            there were other means of raising some or all the money to pay the 2002
                            Loan but whether the Rights Issue in the circumstances was
                            unfair</em>. The availability of other means of repayment in
                        itself did not make the Rights Issue unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As mentioned, <em>HN did not come up with the idea of the
                            Rights Issue at the outset</em>. The Rights Issue was called
                        because of JL’s intransigence. I could well understand HN’s
                        frustration. That is why HN’s responses in cross-examination, which
                        [O&amp;O] relied on, must be considered in context. It also seemed to me
                        that such responses were also given out of pique.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    We do not think that the question of
                    “whether the Rights Issue in the circumstances was unfair” was the
                    only one the Judge ought to have posed. If there had been other means to pay
                    back the 2002 Loan, or <em>no</em> loan was even required
                    in the first place, then plainly the Rights Issue was entirely unnecessary and
                    simply a device to hit back at O&amp;O and dilute the Lauws’ stake in
                    Richvein. The Judge ought to have considered whether HN had acted reasonably
                        <em>contextually</em> instead of readily exonerating
                    him for acting out of “frustration”. In the context of the
                    Important Decision Term, HN had, at the very least, an obligation to seek an
                    appropriate solution to this “difficulty”, even if JL was
                    unreasonable, instead of acting precipitously. What makes HN’s conduct
                    even more difficult to rationalise or excuse is that there was absolutely no
                    time pressure to resolve this issue urgently: see below at <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a>–<a href="#p1_122">[122]</a>. It is trite that a director, especially one representing
                    the majority’s interests, cannot in law exercise a fiduciary duty
                        <em>qua</em> director simply to settle personal
                    scores.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As for the issue of the Rights Issue being
                    precipitated by JL’s refusal to give his personal guarantee, we see that
                    an entirely different view of the matter could also fairly have been taken on
                    the facts: JL’s refusal to give his personal guarantee was borne of
                    HN’s <em>own</em> intransigence in refusing to assist
                    in extricating JL from the guarantee burden. The following admissions made in
                    the course of cross examination by HN are revealing:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    We are puzzled and unconvinced by HN’s
                    stance. He had been copied on each of JL’s letters to DBS and was
                    certainly more than aware that JL was unhappy about having to give a personal
                    guarantee. If he had been sincere in his wish to talk to DBS on JL’s
                    behalf, he could have done so easily. Furthermore, JL <em>had</em> indeed written to HN expressing his unhappiness over having
                    to give a personal guarantee in October 2006. HN, however, did not respond to
                    this. The further clarification HN gave when the appellant’s then counsel
                    pursued this point also merits a reference: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    HN’s responses appear to be
                    disingenuous. There was no attempt whatsoever by him to press the bank to offer
                    the same interest rate on the basis that the security was well in excess of the
                    loan and the healthy historical cash flow enjoyed by the business all but
                    eliminated any default risk to DBS. It appears to us, therefore, that HN had
                    been acting not simply out of frustration as the Judge had found, but cynically
                    for a collateral objective. We explain our reasons for taking this view below at
                        <a href="#p1_124">[124]</a>–<a href="#p1_127">[127]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The memorandum written by KBS to HN
                    proposing the different pricings of the Rights Issue (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above) is in our view a highly pertinent, and
                    implicatory item of evidence staining HN’s already questionable conduct
                    with indelible dubiousness. The Judge, surprisingly, dismissed this piece of
                    evidence as follows (at [111] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for KBS’ memorandum [dated 2 October 2006], it suggested that HN
                        did consider the possibility that [O&amp;O] might refuse to subscribe for
                        its portion of a rights issue. KBS’ memorandum addressed the maximum
                        dilution depending on the pricing but that is different from saying that HN
                        was aiming for a dilution. While the price of $0.38 per rights share might
                        result in maximum dilution, there was no suggestion by [O&amp;O] that the
                        price itself was unjustifiable. <em>Presumably, Bonvests
                            itself would also want to pay the minimum price justifiable</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The Judge’s reasoning here is mistaken
                    .The pricing of the Rights Issue was quite clearly <em>premised
                        on a failure by O&amp;O to subscribe at all</em>. It is obvious that
                    the total amount raised from the Rights Issue would have been the <em>same</em> regardless of per-share pricing. Bonvests and the
                    Lauw family would have paid the same amount regardless of the final price
                    decided upon. So why was there an attempt to price the shares at the lowest
                    amount permissible? Patently, the deliberate low pricing of $0.38 (as opposed to
                    the adjusted net asset per share of $1.06) was an attempt to strengthen
                    Bonvests’ hand in Richvein in the event that the Lauw family failed to
                    partake in the Rights Issue. This is so as a lower rights price would
                    necessarily entail the issuance of more shares, which pursuant to Article 5 of
                    Richvein’s Articles of Association, Bonvests could acquire in full by way
                    of subscribing for excess rights shares in the event O&amp;O fails to subscribe
                    for its portion. The memorandum by KBS on 2 October 2006 could not have
                    been a clearer manifestation of Bonvests’ bad faith towards O&amp;O in
                    relation to its shareholding in Richvein. <em>It is noteworthy
                        that KBS was not called by Bonvests to testify and explain if his memorandum
                        had any other meaning or objective</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In response to O&amp;O’s allegation
                    that it had insufficient funds in Singapore at that point of time to pay for the
                    Rights Issue, the Judge observed (at [116]–[117] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as [O&amp;O] was saying that it did not have available funds in
                        Singapore to subscribe, it had known for some time before the EGM that HN
                        was pushing ahead with the Rights Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Besides, <em>Bonvests also did not have ready cash to
                            subscribe for its portion of the Rights Issue. That was why it was
                            considering taking a loan to do so. It seemed to me that the fact that
                            it was prepared to borrow money at a higher rate of interest than the
                            2002 Loan</em> was not so much an indication of its intention to
                        dilute [O&amp;O]’s stake but of HN’s frustration with JL. In any
                        event, the subsequent repayments of part of shareholders’ loans would
                        have alleviated any temporary need to borrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Two matters are pertinent here: first, that
                    Bonvests too did not have ready cash to subscribe for its portion of the shares
                    potentially to be issued, but yet nevertheless was in a rush to carry through
                    the Rights Issue even though there was no urgency to repay the 2002 Loan; and
                    second, that Bonvests was prepared to borrow money at a higher rate of interest
                    than the 2002 Loan to <em>repay that same
                loan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    We first address the timing issue. Richvein
                    was not facing any pressure from DBS to repay the 2002 Loan, which was only due
                    for repayment slightly more than a year later in 2007. HN conceded during
                    cross-examination: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The inexplicable haste with which the Rights
                    Issue was pushed through meant that no proper cash flow analysis or projections
                    were carried out to assess the need or desirability for the issuance of the new
                    shares. The rejection of JL’s repeated requests for the relevant
                    management accounts to perform such a cash flow analysis calls into question the
                    very propriety of the Rights Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    It should further be noted that there was
                    never any danger of DBS calling an event of default. The 2002 Loan (which at
                    October 2006 had a balance of about $25m) was more than adequately secured by a
                    mortgage of the Hotel, which had been valued at no less than $180m in November
                    2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The haste with which the Rights Issue was
                        <em>implemented</em> is also highly significant. HN
                    permitted only eight days for JL to raise over $7m to subscribe for the new
                    shares after the vote was taken at the Rights Issue EGM. Two requests by O&amp;O
                    on 1 and 2 November for just <em>one week’s</em>
                    extension of the deadline were ignored (see above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>) despite the
                    utter lack of urgency for the funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    During cross-examination, HN admitted that
                    the requests for an extension of time to make payment were deliberately ignored
                    so as to make it difficult for O&amp;O to subscribe for the rights
                        shares:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">This pattern of cynical conduct is entirely consistent with the
                    reference in KBS’ memorandum, dated 2 October 2006, (above at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> ), to the fact that if JL was unable to
                    subscribe to the Rights Issue the new share issue at the proposed price would
                    dilute the proportion of Lauw family’s stake in Richvein to the maximum
                    extent possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Admittedly, there was nothing inherently
                    wrong in trying to repay the 2002 Loan, even if it was a year in advance of the
                    deadline. But, as held in <em>Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum
                        and others</em> [1973] AC 821, the issue of shares for any reason
                    other than to raise capital – for instance, to dilute the voting power of
                    others – amounts to a breach of fiduciary duties by the directors of the
                    company and may be set aside by the court. Further, if directors representing
                    majority shareholders abuse voting powers by voting in bad faith or for a
                    collateral purpose, oppression can be said to have been established: see
                        <em>Polybuilding (S) Pte Ltd v Lim Heng Lee and
                        Ors</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 12 (“<em>Polybuilding</em>”). In this regard, we are in agreement with
                    Mr Menon’s contention that the lack of urgency for new funds –
                    especially when contrasted with the speed at which the issue of new shares is
                    carried out – is often a good indication of what the true objective of the
                    rights issue is. The raising of capital for a company is always a serious matter
                    that merits careful consideration. This is particularly so if it could have
                    consequences that might affect the proportion of shareholdings in a
                    quasi-partnership type company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The fact that Bonvests was willing to borrow
                    at a higher rate of interest than the 2002 Loan (4.5% compared to 3.83%) to pay
                    back that same loan through subscribing to its share of the Rights Issue is even
                    more damning. The following exchange when HN was cross examined says it
                        all<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So Bonvests was prepared to borrow money at a
                            higher rate to pay off part of a loan which had a lower interest rate;
                            right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In any case, in the final analysis, it can
                    be confidently said that there had been really no valid commercial justification
                    for the Rights Issue. HN conceded during cross-examination that <em>without</em> the Rights Issue, Richvein would have been able
                    to repay $19m of the total outstanding loan of $25m by August 2007, thus leaving
                    a balance of only $6m to refinance when the 2002 Loan fell due in November 2007.
                    There would have been no difficulty refinancing the balance of the loan in
                    November 2007, given the availability of the Hotel as security for any new loan
                    facility. We also find the rapid sequence of shareholder loan repayments made
                    not long after the Rights Issue rather remarkable, to say the least. About a
                    month after the Rights Issue (which raised the total sum of $25,080,000, of
                    which $7,524,000 came from O&amp;O alone), Richvein repaid shareholder loans
                    amounting to $3m. In a letter dated 15 December 2006 responding to
                    JL’s queries about the sudden repayment of shareholders’ loans,
                    Richvein stated that it could do so because it had “surplus funds in
                    excess of [its] operational requirements”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>
                    Altogether $14,441,736 was repaid to the shareholders between 5 December
                    2006 and 30 August 2007. <em>Why then had the Rights Issue even
                        been undertaken without a proper study of the cash flow requirements of the
                        company?</em> To our minds, this is unassailable evidence that the
                    Rights Issue was ill-conceived and hastily executed for a dubious
                    objective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    It is also telling that Richvein’s
                    first-ever dividends in thirty years were declared in the second half of 2007,
                        <em>less than a year after the Rights Issue in November
                        2006</em>. On 11 May 2007, HN wrote to JL in response to the
                    latter’s queries about Richvein’s dividend policy:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, priority should be to reduce shareholders’ loan. Company
                        will consider declaring dividends to shareholders after the
                        shareholders’ loan are fully repaid, <em>subject to
                            cashflow requirements, investment needs and adequacy of
                            reserves</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is certainly paradoxical that HN suddenly became concerned about
                    Richvein’s cash flow only <em>after</em> the Rights
                    Issue had been muscled through! Indeed, given that Richvein had been profitable
                    since 2002,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> it was odd that a proper cash flow analysis
                    had not been carried out – if not in 2002, then in any of the intervening
                    profitable years – prior to the major decision concerning the Rights
                    Issue. This was an issue that JL, as a director representing a significant
                    interest in Richvein, ought to have been fully briefed on prior to the Rights
                    Issue to enable him to properly discharge his duties <em>qua</em> director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Further, it has also not been denied that
                    alternative avenues of funding – banks other than DBS, financial
                    institutions and Richvein’s own cash flow – were not seriously
                    explored. Indeed, there had not even been any attempt to negotiate with DBS as
                    to the best interest rate possible should there be no personal guarantee from
                    JL. At this juncture, it is worthwhile to note that there is more than a hint of
                    hypocrisy in HN’s alleged motivation in securing the best interest rate
                    for the refinancing package (see <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>
                    above); for he was ready to arrange for Bonvests (a listed public company) to
                    take up a new loan to subscribe for the Rights Issue at an interest rate that
                    was approximately 0.7% higher than that for the 2002 Loan!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    This entirely unnecessary haste in deciding
                    on and muscling through the Rights Issue, coupled with the complete absence of
                    any commercial justification for the exercise is a testament to just how
                    capricious the whole process was. It smacked of an abuse of rights. In this
                    connection we note that the Lauw family had plainly suffered prejudice from the
                    Rights Issue: they had been put to considerable inconvenience to put up extra
                    capital (and incurred not insubstantial interest payments and the loss of the
                    use of a large sum of money) for no valid commercial reason because they had no
                    real alternative but to fend off a barely-concealed and ill-conceived attempt to
                    dilute O&amp;O’s shareholding in Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The court, where oppression is alleged, has
                    to have regard to all the circumstances and take into consideration the
                    cumulative effect of the impugned conduct. In the light of all of the events
                    rehearsed above, we are of the opinion that the Rights Issue and the Share
                    Transfer, viewed in conjunction with the overarching background of the Related
                    Party Transactions, comprised clear evidence of unfairness that amounted to
                    oppressive conduct against O&amp;O. This was not a case of just a single
                    isolated act or episode of minority oppression, but rather a deliberate
                        <em>course of conduct</em> that steadily grew in
                    brazenness with the passage of time. The Lauws have in all invested some $47.1m
                    into Richvein. To date they have earned no returns whatsoever from their
                    investment; they received no remuneration and, further, earned no dividends,
                    until after it was plain to all that the Rights Issue had raised entirely
                    unnecessary capital. On the other hand, the Sianandar family had, by the
                    transfer of their shareholdings to Bonvests, effectively unlocked the value of
                    their shareholdings in Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    While HN’s actions in the Related
                    Party Transactions were insufficient on their own to justify any finding of
                    oppression, they reinforce the perception that HN had been in the habit of
                    riding roughshod over the Lauw family’s interests in Richvein when it
                    mattered. In the final analysis, there is no gainsaying that the Rights Issue
                    – even if it was not engineered to dilute the Lauw family’s
                    shareholding in Richvein – was a disturbingly disproportionate response to
                    an allegedly “difficult” minority shareholder which was insisting
                    on the strict observance of its legal rights. The absence of any reasonable
                    commercial justification for this precipitative and imprudent course of action
                    taken by HN is strongly redolent of commercial unfairness and the abuse of
                    majority rights in a corporate setting. In the result, the Rights Issue proved
                    to be one step too far and became the proverbial straw that broke the
                    camel’s back, culminating in the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The touchstone in any oppression action is
                    fairness. By any yardstick, HN, and the shareholders he represented, had
                    repeatedly conducted (in the instances referred to above) the affairs of
                    Richvein in a commercially unfair manner that has also occasioned grave
                    prejudice to O&amp;O. We also find that as a quasi-partnership between Bonvests
                    and O&amp;O existed, the Rights Issue alone – as an instance of
                    “single act” injustice – would have been sufficient basis
                    for a finding of oppression pursuant to s 216.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In the circumstances, the appeal is allowed.
                    There is obviously no residual goodwill or trust left between the parties and
                    therefore we do not think it would be right for O&amp;O’s shareholding to
                    remain tied up with the company in a broken and bitter relationship. Nor do we
                    think it would be appropriate for us to attempt to regulate future conduct of
                    the company’s affairs. The appropriate relief in this case is to permit
                    O&amp;O to realise the value of its shares at a fair value pursuant to
                        s 216(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Companies
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    As the breakdown in the relationship between
                    the parties was entirely precipitated by HN’s inappropriate conduct we do
                    not think that it would be fair for O&amp;O to sell its shares in Richvein to
                    Bonvests at a discount on the basis of its minority stake. It is to us a crucial
                    consideration that there are also no other minority interests involved and were
                    Bonvests to purchase O&amp;O’shareholding in Richvein it would become the
                    sole shareholder of a valuable asset. In the light of this, we are of the view
                    that the appropriate order is to have the fair market value of Richvein
                    ascertained by an independent valuer. The parties are to agree on the
                    appointment of an independent valuer and if they are unable to do so within 14
                    days from the date hereof they are to write to this court to appoint same. The
                    independent valuer is to assess the value of Richvein on the basis of the fair
                    market value of its assets <em>as of the date of this
                        decision</em>. Within 14 days of receipt of this independent
                    valuer’s valuation, Bonvests is to decide whether it will purchase the
                    entire shareholding of O&amp;O on the basis of this valuation. Such a purchase
                    should be completed within three months of Bonvests’ decision. In the
                    event Bonvests elects not to purchase O&amp;O’s shares in Richvein, then
                    O&amp;O may proceed to wind up Richvein and appoint an independent liquidator to
                    realise and distribute its assets. The costs of the liquidation, if this
                    happens, are to be paid from the assets of Richvein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    O&amp;O is to have the costs of the
                    proceedings here and below with the usual consequential orders to apply. Parties
                    are at liberty to apply in relation to the modalities involved in implementing
                    our directions.</p>
