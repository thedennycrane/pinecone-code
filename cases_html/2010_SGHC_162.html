        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the Law Society of
                    Singapore (“the Law Society”) pursuant to section 98(1) of
                    the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”) for an order that the Respondent be made to suffer such punishment
                    as provided for in section 83(1) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent was admitted to the roll of
                    advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore (“the
                    roll”) on 20 March 1993 and, at all material times, he practised as
                    a Partner in a leading Singapore law firm (“the firm”). On
                    21 April 2008, the Respondent pleaded guilty, in the District Court of the
                    Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to a charge of burglary contrary to
                    ss 11(1)(b) and (4) of the Hong Kong Theft Ordinance (Cap 210)
                    (“the HK Theft Ordinance”). The charge stated that on
                    17 January 2008, the Respondent had entered a hotel room in Hong Kong and
                    stolen a bag, a blue tooth earphone, a charger, an iPod, a mobile phone, a
                    mobile phone SIM card as well as a Palm Pilot (PDA). These items were valued by
                    the police to be worth HK$9,500. On 23 April 2008, the Hong Kong District
                    Court convicted and sentenced the Respondent to 12 months imprisonment,
                    suspended for two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 24 April 2008, the Respondent wrote to
                    inform the Law Society of his conviction and stated that he had voluntarily
                    suspended himself from practice. Since 2 January 2009, he has been employed
                    by the firm in a non-practising capacity. On 3 July 2009, a Disciplinary
                    Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was appointed to hear and investigate
                    the complaint against the Respondent pursuant to s 90(1) of the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Law Society was of the view that the offence
                    committed by the Respondent would, if committed in Singapore, be an offence
                    contrary to s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Penal Code”). The Law Society formulated the following
                    charge against the Respondent, as follows (though see now below at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [the Respondent], an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of
                        Singapore, are charged that you, on or about 17<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>January 2008 at the Novotel Citygate Hotel,
                        Hong Kong, having entered Room 1935 as a trespasser, stole a bag, a
                        blue tooth earphone, a charger, an i-Pod, a mobile phone, a mobile phone SIM
                        card, and a Palm Pilot PDA, which was an offence of burglary committed under
                        section 11(1)(b) and (4) of the Hong Kong Theft Ordinance
                        Cap. 210, and you have thereby committed an act of misconduct
                        unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court of
                        Singapore or as a member of an honourable profession contrary to
                        section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sections 83(1) and 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    Act provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)   All advocates and solicitors shall be
                        subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause
                        shown —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>)   to be struck off
                            the roll;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>)   to be suspended
                            from practice for a period not exceeding 5 years;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>)   to pay a penalty of
                            not more than $100,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>d</em>)   to be censured;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>e</em>)   to suffer the
                            punishment referred to in paragraph (<em>c</em>) in addition to the punishment referred to in
                                paragraph (<em>b</em>) or (<em>d</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate
                        and solicitor —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>h</em>)   has been guilty of
                            such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of
                            the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The criminal proceedings in Hong Kong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 17 January 2008, the Respondent arrived
                    in Hong Kong on a business trip and checked into Room 1939 of the Novotel
                    Citygate Hotel. The occupant of Room 1935 had left the room at 10.45pm and
                    was unsure whether he had properly closed the door of his room. At 11.50pm, when
                    the occupant of Room 1935 returned to his room, he found some items
                    missing. He immediately contacted the hotel staff who subsequently viewed the
                    video recording of the CCTV which monitored the corridor outside that room. The
                    Respondent was seen in the video to be at the door of Room 1935 five times.
                    There was no image of the Respondent entering the room due to the position of
                    the camera. There were two occasions when the Respondent was out of sight for
                    about one minute. He was later seen walking with some items in his left hand
                    towards Rooms 1938 and 1939. Room 1938 was unoccupied while
                    Room 1939 was occupied by the Respondent. The lobby manager, along with the
                    hotel’s security manager and some police officers, went to the
                    Respondent’s room. They searched his room and discovered the missing items
                    under the Respondent’s bed. A fingerprint was lifted on the outside of the
                    door at Room 1935 and was found to match the fingerprint impression of the
                    right middle finger of the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent was subsequently charged with the
                    offence of burglary under ss 11(1)(<em>b</em>) and (4)
                    of the HK Theft Ordinance. Section 11 of the HK Theft Ordinance reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)   A person commits burglary if-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…(<em>b</em>)   having
                            entered any building or part of a building as a trespasser he steals or
                            attempts to steal anything in the building or that part of it or
                            inflicts or attempts to inflict on any person therein any grievous
                            bodily harm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)   Any person who commits burglary shall be guilty of an
                        offence and shall be liable on conviction upon indictment to imprisonment
                        for 14 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 2 of the HK Theft Ordinance equates the meaning of
                    “steal” with that of “theft”. Section 2 reads
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)   A person commits theft if he <em>dishonestly appropriates property</em> belonging to another with
                        the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and
                        “thief” and <em>“steal”</em> shall be construed accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   It is immaterial whether the appropriation is made
                        with a view to gain, or is made for the thief's own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Respondent subsequently appointed a leading
                    criminal lawyer, Mr Andrew Bruce SC, to represent him in the criminal
                    proceedings before the Hong Kong District Court. He also consulted two
                    psychiatrists in Hong Kong. They were Dr Stephen Ng Wai Mang
                    (“Dr Ng”) and Dr Lo Chun Wai
                    (“Dr Lo”), respectively. Both the psychiatrists diagnosed the
                    Respondent as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. On 21 April 2008,
                    the Respondent pleaded guilty to the charge and did not dispute the elements of
                    the charge. However, in mitigation, the Respondent submitted that he was
                    suffering from Major Depressive Disorder at the time of the offence which
                    affected his judgment and awareness of his conduct. Dr Ng and Dr Lo
                    were called to give evidence. As already mentioned, the Hong Kong District Court
                    convicted and sentenced the Respondent to 12 months imprisonment, suspended
                    for two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal in
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the proceedings before the Tribunal on
                    22 September 2009, the Law Society tendered the following Amended Charge
                    upon receiving representations from the Respondent (“the Amended
                    Charge”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [the Respondent], an Advocate and Solicitor of the
                        Supreme Court of Singapore, are charged that you, on or about
                            21<sup>st </sup>April 2008, were convicted by the
                        District Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of an offence
                        of burglary under section 11(1)(b) and (4) of the Hong Kong Theft
                        Ordinance Cap. 210, the particulars of the offence in Hong Kong being
                        that you -</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“on the 17<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>day of January 2008, in Hong Kong,
                            having entered as a trespasser part of a building known as
                            Room 1935, Novotel Citygate Hotel, No. 51, Man Tung Road, Tung
                            Chung, Lantau Island, New Territories, stole therein one bag, one blue
                            tooth earphone, one charger, one iPod, one mobile phone, one mobile
                            phone SIM card and one palm pilot”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and you have thereby committed an act of misconduct unbefitting an
                        advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court of Singapore or as
                        a member of an honourable profession contrary to section 83(2)(h) of
                        the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Law Society also removed all references to the Penal Code from its
                    Statement of Claim. The understanding between the Law Society and the Respondent
                    was set out in a letter from the firm dated 10 September 2009 to counsel
                    for the Law Society, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    even if the Law Society agrees that dishonesty is
                            not one of the elements of the charge levied against [the Respondent],
                            the Law Society is not (and should not be seen to be) agreeing that [the
                            Respondent] was not dishonest;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    all that the Law Society is saying is that the law
                            does not require it to prove dishonesty to succeed in its charge that
                            [the Respondent] was guilty of conduct unbefitting an advocate and
                            solicitor and that as such, the Law Society will not be seeking to prove
                            dishonesty as an element of the charge;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c)    whether [the Respondent] was or was not dishonest
                            is, so far as the Law Society is concerned, a matter which remains open
                            for consideration on the basis of the evidence before the Court of Three
                            Judges when deciding on the appropriate sanction to be imposed on [the
                            Respondent] notwithstanding that the Law Society is not seeking to prove
                            dishonesty for the purpose of securing a conviction on the charge;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d)    although the conviction of [the Respondent] in Hong
                            Kong is not conclusive evidence of his dishonesty, it is a fact that
                            [the Respondent] pleaded guilty to an offence which under Hong Kong law
                            contains an element of dishonesty. This is a fact which [counsel for the
                            Respondent is] not disputing although [the firm] will be arguing that
                            the significance of this fact to the issue of whether [the Respondent]
                            was in fact dishonest will depend on all the evidence that will be
                            before the Court of Three Judges including [the Respondent’s]
                            evidence as to his state of mind and motivation/reasons for deciding to
                            plead guilty to the offence in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Respondent pleaded guilty to the Amended
                    Charge. However, he informed the Tribunal that he would be leading evidence on
                    the issue of dishonesty in order to refute the plea of guilt. The Respondent
                    filed two affidavits, his own and that of the psychiatrist he had been
                    consulting since 2 May 2008, Dr Ko Soo Meng
                    (“Dr Ko”). Dr Ko was cross-examined by counsel for the
                    Law Society, Mr Michael Khoo SC. The Respondent contended that he had
                    pleaded guilty because he felt that he was unable to undergo the approximate
                    one-year period that the actual criminal proceedings might take if he did not
                    plead guilty before the Hong Kong court, not least because he was afraid that
                    his mental condition would deteriorate further as a result. There was also the
                    prospect of at least three years of incarceration if he was convicted after
                        trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    (which was apparently the “tariff” in Hong Kong for such
                        cases).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Dr Ko was of the opinion that the Respondent had been suffering from a
                    psychiatric condition known as a Major Depressive Episode before and up to the
                    date of the incident in Hong Kong. In his view, the Respondent’s conduct
                    on the date of the incident was the result of and consistent with a Major
                    Depressive Episode and the Respondent could not have formed the intention to
                    carry out the acts in question in order to cause gain to himself or loss to the
                        victim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Law Society did not adduce any psychiatric
                    evidence to refute the diagnosis made by Dr Ko. However, it was submitted
                    that Dr Ko’s evidence was weak as it was overly reliant on the
                    reports of Dr Ng and Dr Lo. There was no credible evidence that the
                    Respondent was suffering from a Major Depressive Episode at the time of the
                    offence and even if there was, this did not detract from the fact that the
                    Respondent had the requisite <em>mens rea</em> for the
                    offence. The Respondent’s guilty plea in Hong Kong was proof (albeit
                    inconclusive) of his having acted dishonestly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Tribunal found that sufficient gravity for
                    disciplinary action against the Respondent existed under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act. The Tribunal found that the evidence
                    given by Dr Ko was flawed and weak. Dr Ko was overly reliant on the
                    reports of Dr Ng and Dr Lo and he appeared to have had a limited
                    knowledge of the facts. Significant weight had to be placed on the
                    Respondent’s guilty plea and resulting conviction in Hong Kong. His plea
                    was unequivocal and he had expressly admitted to the elements of the offence.
                    However, the Tribunal found that the Law Society had failed to discharge the
                    burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Respondent had been
                    dishonest. The Tribunal was of the view that the Law Society had failed to
                    comprehensively test the evidence adduced by the Respondent and that the Law
                    Society could also have adduced evidence from a psychiatrist to affirmatively
                    prove that the Respondent’s behaviour and CCTV footage demonstrated that
                    the Respondent had not, in fact, been acting under the influence of a Major
                    Depressive Episode.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Respondent had also been admitted as a
                    solicitor in Hong Kong on 4 January 2000. However, he did not hold a
                    practising certificate at the time of commission of the offence. Following his
                    conviction in Hong Kong, the Director of Compliance of the Law Society of Hong
                    Kong applied under s 9A of the Hong Kong Legal Practitioners Ordinance
                    (Cap 159) that the Respondent be required to answer the allegation in the
                    following Complaint:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, [the Respondent], being a solicitor and an officer of the court,
                        failed to conduct yourself appropriately in private matters in that you were
                        convicted of one count of Burglary on 21 April 2008 on your own plea
                        and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, sentence to be suspended
                        for 2 years and was thereby in breach of principle 1.02 of the
                        Hong Kong Solicitor’s Guide to Professional Conduct Volume 1.
                        Such conduct unbefitting a solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Practice Direction I2, which came into effect on 1 June
                    1995, states that solicitors in Hong Kong are required to comply with the
                    standards of practice and rules of conduct set out in <em>The
                        Hong Kong Solicitors’ Guide to Professional Conduct</em> first
                    published by the Law Society of Hong Kong in 1995 and revised from time to time.
                    Principle 1.02 of <em>The Hong Kong Solicitor’s Guide
                        to Professional Conduct Volume 1</em> reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A solicitor is an officer of the Court (see s 3(2) of the Legal
                        Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159)) and should conduct himself
                        appropriately in professional and private matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent appeared before the Hong Kong
                    Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (“the Hong Kong Tribunal”) on
                    17 December 2009. The Tribunal suspended the Respondent for five years and
                    imposed some conditions on his right to practise after the suspension (see also
                    below at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Law Society’s arguments before this
                court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In its written submissions to this Court, the
                    Law Society argued that the Tribunal had erred in holding that the burden was on
                    the Law Society to positively establish that the Respondent was dishonest at the
                    time of the offence. According to the Law Society, the Respondent had pleaded
                    guilty to the disciplinary charge but there was a divergence between the parties
                    on the factual basis for sentencing, <em>ie</em>, whether
                    the Respondent should be considered to have been guilty of dishonest conduct for
                    the purposes of sentencing. Therefore, the Tribunal conducted a particular form
                    of a Newton hearing: a reverse Newton hearing to determine the issue of
                    dishonesty. In the reverse Newton hearing, the Respondent was required to prove
                    that he was not dishonest because the issue of dishonesty related to extraneous
                    matters which the Law Society could not have proved as part of its case had
                    there been a trial. The disputed facts as to whether the Respondent was
                    dishonest were within the Respondent’s exclusive knowledge and, therefore,
                    the Respondent had the burden of disproving dishonesty on a balance of
                    probabilities. The Respondent had failed to discharge this burden as the
                    relevant evidence clearly demonstrated that the Respondent had a dishonest
                    intent at the time he misappropriated the items concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Further, in oral submissions before this
                    court, Mr Khoo, argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the
                    Respondent, having pleaded guilty to the charge of burglary which itself
                    incorporated the element of dishonesty, could not now argue that he had not been
                    dishonest because the absence of the element of dishonesty would have entailed a
                    rejection of the Respondent’s plea of guilt in the first place. The
                    attempt by the Respondent in the present proceedings to argue that he had not
                    been dishonest was, in substance, a collateral attack on his
                conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the appropriate sentence, the Law Society,
                    in its written submissions, argued that the Respondent should be struck of the
                    roll in accordance with established case law involving solicitors guilty of
                    proven dishonesty. Interestingly, during oral submissions, after Mr Khoo
                    had sight of the sentence imposed by the Hong Kong Tribunal, Mr Khoo
                    submitted that the sentence imposed here should be at least the same as that
                    imposed by the Hong Kong Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Respondent’s arguments before this
                court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before this court, counsel for the Respondent,
                    Ms Aurill Kam, submitted that the Law Society had the burden of proving,
                    beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Respondent had been dishonest. Having
                    secured a plea of guilt by the Respondent to a disciplinary charge without
                    dishonesty (and thereby avoiding the burden of proving dishonesty), it would be
                    unfair for the Law Society to have the Respondent sentenced on a more serious
                    charge involving dishonesty and yet also have the burden of proof transferred to
                    the Respondent. The Respondent submitted that a Newton hearing was not necessary
                    and could not be used as a pretext or disguise for inflating the misconduct
                    beyond the elements alleged and pleaded to in the Amended Charge. The Respondent
                    emphasised that it was common ground between the parties that the Hong Kong
                    conviction was not conclusive as to any issue in the current proceedings. As we
                    point out below, this raises the key issue as to whether the Hong Kong
                    conviction can be considered by this court and, if so, what weight should be
                    placed upon it (see also below at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>)
                    – an issue which we will consider in more detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent had explained his reasons for
                    pleading guilty although he felt that he did not possess any criminal intent at
                    the time he allegedly misappropriated the items. It was therefore incumbent on
                    the Law Society to challenge the Respondent with regard to his reasons for
                    pleading guilty. Yet, the Law Society had chosen not to call any evidence of its
                    own before the Tribunal to demonstrate that the Respondent had been dishonest
                    and sought to rely solely on the fact of the Respondent’s plea of guilt in
                    Hong Kong. In any event, the evidence demonstrated that the Respondent had not
                    acted dishonestly. The Respondent was suffering from a Major Depressive Episode
                    that impaired his ability to form a dishonest intent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the issue of sentence, the Respondent
                    submitted that he should not be struck off the roll as he had not been
                    dishonest. This was a case where the misconduct stemmed from mental infirmity.
                    The decision of this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v
                        Chiong Chin May Selena</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 320
                        (“<em>Chiong Chin May Selena</em>”) was
                    referred to by the Respondent as guidance on the approach to be taken in such
                    cases. In that case, the solicitor had failed to prepare or maintain (for her
                    sole proprietorship) any of the requisite financial records or documents that
                    was mandated by the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules
                    (Cap 161, R8, 1999 Rev Ed). She was found to have been suffering from
                    manic-depressive psychosis and had earlier been hospitalised and underwent
                    intensive electro-convulsive therapy for post-natal depression. The court in
                    that case suspended her from practice for one year, coupled with an undertaking
                    that she would not commence another sole proprietorship. The court had observed
                    (at [34]) that “the appropriate punishment must be tempered by some
                    measure of sensitivity to the [solicitor’s] plight …. The
                    [solicitor] is clearly an able person who ought to be able to practice once her
                    medical condition [stabilised]”. The Respondent submitted that a fixed
                    term of suspension would be inappropriate and arbitrary in the current case as
                    there was no certainty as to when the Respondent would recover from his mental
                    illness. The paramount consideration of the protection of the public would be
                    adequately served by the Respondent’s voluntary undertakings not to apply
                    for a practising certificate without: (i) medical certification of fitness;
                    (ii) consent of the Law Society; and (iii) leave of court. Therefore,
                    the Respondent argued, the appropriate punishment was a censure coupled with the
                    undertakings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The approach adopted by the Respondent in the
                    present proceedings was not unlike that adopted in the Hong Kong disciplinary
                    proceedings (with one salient difference, which we will touch on below (at
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>)). The gist of the
                    Respondent’s case before this court was that he had pleaded guilty to the
                    charge of burglary before the Hong Kong District Court for extralegal reasons.
                    In point of fact, his argument goes, he did not possess any criminal intent at
                    the time he allegedly misappropriated the items concerned. Put simply, he did
                    not know what he was doing and, hence, could not have been guilty of any
                    dishonesty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the other hand, counsel for the Law
                    Society, Mr Khoo, in his oral submissions before this court, pointed out,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the Respondent had clearly
                    pleaded guilty to the charge of burglary which itself necessarily incorporated
                    the element of dishonesty (see also above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). He had admitted to dishonesty at least twice, once before
                    the Hong Kong District Court and then before the Hong Kong Tribunal. In the
                    circumstances, any argument to the effect that there had been no dishonesty on
                    the part of the Respondent could not now be made as it would have entailed the
                    rejection of the Respondent’s plea of guilt in the first place.
                    Mr Khoo submitted that the only issue before this court was the appropriate
                    sentence to order and that, in any event, the relevant evidence clearly
                    demonstrated that the Respondent had a dishonest intent at the time he
                    misappropriated the items concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Having considered the submissions proffered by
                    both parties, the key issue centres, in our view, on this main question: Can the
                    Hong Kong conviction be considered by this court and, if so, what weight should
                    be placed upon it?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Turning first to the threshold question: can
                    this court have regard to the Hong Kong conviction? The answer to this question
                    seems to us to be clear (and both parties accepted it) – that we can
                    indeed consider the Hong Kong conviction. It is a relevant – indeed,
                    crucial – fact in the context of the present proceedings. As a matter of
                    fact, if the conviction had been meted out in Singapore, the Respondent would
                    not even have been able to argue against his conviction as it would have been
                    conclusive pursuant to s 83(6) of the Act. We pause to observe that it was
                    precisely because the present proceedings involved a criminal conviction in a
                    foreign jurisdiction that the Law Society brought the charge against the
                    Respondent pursuant to s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act
                    (instead of s 83(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act). We also
                    note that whilst s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) is, indeed, a
                    “catch all” provision (see, for example, the decision of this
                    court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing</em>
                    [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 at [40]), it <em>also</em>
                    encompasses the <em>more serious</em> forms of misconduct
                    (including dishonest conduct) and can also furnish the legal basis for striking
                    the advocate and solicitor off the roll (see, for example, the decision of this
                    court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Khushvinder Singh
                        Chopra</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The <em>further</em>
                    issue (also alluded to above) is what <em>weight</em> we
                    should accord to that conviction in the context of the present proceedings
                    – an issue to which our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is clear that when the Respondent pleaded
                    guilty before the Hong Kong court in the criminal proceedings, he knew precisely
                    what that plea of guilt meant and entailed. After all, he was himself a lawyer
                    of considerable experience and was also represented by counsel (in fact, a
                    Senior Counsel who is described, in the Respondent’s own affidavit, as
                    “a leading criminal silk in Hong Kong”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (see also above at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>)). In the circumstances, he had more
                    than adequate legal resources available to him in order to enable him to arrive
                    at an informed decision as to whether or not to plead guilty to the charge
                    concerned. He also fully understood the charge that was preferred against him,
                    which charge clearly – by its very nature – involved an element or
                    ingredient of dishonesty (this was confirmed during proceedings before the
                    Tribunal in the context of the present proceedings).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He
                    also knew – and, in fact admitted - that there was no
                    assurance that the decision would, if he had claimed trial, not have gone
                    against him and that he would then have faced the prospect of a three year jail
                    term (see also above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). Indeed, we
                    would have thought that if the Respondent had, at the material time, been
                    convinced of his innocence, he should have claimed trial and contested the
                    charge at that particular point in time. In his affidavit, the Respondent
                    admitted that his counsel for the criminal proceedings had taken pains to make
                    his position clear because, “before the hearing, the Prosecution had
                    queried if a plea of guilt was appropriate given the medical evidence
                        tendered”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This is, indeed, also clear from the
                    opening statement by counsel himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> With respect, however, this is neither here nor
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, the Respondent now argues that he had
                    pleaded guilty for the extralegal reasons set out briefly above (at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) and that he had never possessed a dishonest
                    intent at any time. If so, as Mr Khoo correctly pointed out, the
                    Respondent’s plea of guilt ought to have been <em>rejected</em> by the judge. We also agree with Mr Khoo that what
                    the Respondent is now attempting, in quite distinct and separate proceedings, is
                    to effect what is (in substance) a collateral attack on the Hong Kong
                    conviction. The Respondent vehemently denies this but we must look, in the final
                    analysis, at the substance and not merely the form of any argument placed before
                    us. As importantly, we must also examine the relevant arguments made for both
                    their logic as well as their coherence. Having adopted this approach, we are of
                    the view that – on any reasonable as well as logical view – the
                    Respondent <em>is</em>, in substance, mounting a collateral
                    attack on the Hong Kong conviction. Put simply, either the Hong Kong conviction
                    was premised on an appropriate legal basis or it was not. If the Respondent is
                    correct in arguing that he pleaded guilty to the charge even though he did not
                    possess the necessary criminal intent, his plea of guilt ought to have been
                    vitiated. We pause to observe, parenthetically, that he did not appeal against
                    his conviction. Be that as it may, he attempted the same argument in the context
                    of the Hong Kong <em>disciplinary proceedings</em> before
                    the Hong Kong Tribunal. However (and this is the difference from the present
                    proceedings), because counsel for the Law Society of Hong Kong argued (as did
                    Mr Khoo in the present proceedings) that the Respondent was attempting a
                    collateral attack on the Hong Kong conviction, the Respondent refrained from
                    continuing to pursue that argument (a fuller account of the proceedings before
                    the Hong Kong Tribunal can be found below at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>).
                    Unfortunately, the Respondent did not similarly desist in the context of the
                    present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As Mr Khoo pointed out – correctly,
                    in our view - the Law Society, in amending the charge against
                    the Respondent, was <em>not</em> conceding that the
                    Respondent was not dishonest (that this was indeed the Law Society’s
                    position was demonstrated in no uncertain terms by a letter written by
                    Mr Khoo, on behalf of the Law Society, to the Respondent’s solicitors
                    (dated 16 September 2009)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and, indeed, by the
                    correspondence between the Respondent’s solicitors and Mr Khoo
                    generally (including the letter just mentioned)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>). However, as the
                    relevant conviction was one meted out in a foreign jurisdiction (here, Hong
                    Kong), there could <em>not</em> (as we have just noted)
                    have been <em>a conclusive presumption</em> of the element
                    of dishonesty as such (pursuant to s 83(6) of the Act). It was therefore
                    – at least theoretically - open to the Respondent to
                    argue that he had not been guilty of dishonesty but this would have entailed (as
                    we have been at pains to point out) a collateral attack on the Hong Kong
                    conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Whilst it is true that the Tribunal found that
                    the Respondent was not dishonest, this is a finding that was, with respect,
                    based on erroneous grounds. With respect, we are of the view that the Tribunal
                    should not have embarked on an <em>independent</em> inquiry
                    as to whether or not the Respondent was dishonest. The focus ought to have been
                    the Hong Kong conviction in general and how it was arrived at in particular.
                    Whilst the Tribunal did refer to the Hong Kong conviction, it did not focus on
                    it as such, preferring, instead, to consider the psychiatric evidence
                    independently. In any event, we agree with Mr Khoo that the main reason why
                    the Tribunal held that no dishonesty had been proved <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Respondent was itself premised on an erroneous
                    ground, <em>viz</em>, that the Law Society had not adduced
                    any psychiatric evidence to rebut the psychiatric evidence tendered on behalf of
                    the Respondent. Whilst we leave open the reason proffered by Mr Khoo,
                        <em>viz</em>, that there was no point in the Law
                    Society adducing psychiatric evidence as any evidence would have been too far
                    removed in point of time from the Respondent’s mental state at the
                    material juncture and would therefore have been simply unhelpful, we are of the
                    view that the omission by the Law Society to adduce its own psychiatric evidence
                    was not relevant in any event. We pause at this juncture to note that although
                    the Respondent did adduce psychiatric evidence, this was – in and of
                    itself - neither here nor there. It is, in fact, significant
                    to note that, in any event, such evidence merely repeated (in substance) the
                    psychiatric evidence tendered in the Hong Kong criminal proceedings. Such
                    evidence was only relevant in order to demonstrate (as we have already noted)
                    that the Hong Kong conviction was (in substance) erroneous. But that merely
                    brings us back full circle, so to speak, to the weight (if any) that ought to be
                    placed on the Hong Kong conviction in the first instance. Hence, the fact that
                    the Law Society did not adduce psychiatric evidence did not, with respect,
                    justify the Tribunal’s finding to the effect that no dishonesty had been
                    proved <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is of the first importance to note, at the
                    outset, that the Hong Kong legal system was – like its Singapore
                    counterpart – inherited from Britain. As former colonies, the common law
                    system was introduced into both these countries and they share – to a
                    large extent – the same legal heritage. More particularly, although Hong
                    Kong is now part of the People’s Republic of China, it continues to
                    administer a (separate and quite distinct) common law system. Looked at in this
                    light, it appears to us that – absent exceptional circumstances
                        - the greatest weight ought to be placed upon the Hong
                    Kong conviction. Indeed, this would be an appropriate juncture to consider the
                    Hong Kong conviction in its context. In particular, – and as we shall see
                        - the judge’s reasons in arriving at the sentence
                    imposed on the Respondent not only speaks volumes but also serves to
                    simultaneously undermine the very foundation of the Respondent’s argument
                    before this court, <em>viz</em>, that he (the Respondent)
                    did not possess dishonest intent because his mind was, at the time he allegedly
                    misappropriated the items in question, a complete blank. It was, in effect, an
                    argument centring on a state of “automatism” in which the
                    Respondent was not aware at all of his actions. Even a moment’s reflection
                    will reveal that this is an argument that is based on an extreme mental state
                    which, whilst not necessarily unconnected to depression, goes <em>much further</em> inasmuch as it attributes to (here) the Respondent
                    a (temporary) “robotic existence” from the time he took the items
                    concerned until he arrived back at his room. If the Respondent’s story is
                    to be believed, he then “snapped out” of this “robotic
                    state”, panicked and (as a consequence) placed the items under his bed
                    (where they were subsequently discovered) as well as took the SIM card out of
                    the mobile phone and placed it in his coat pocket (which account was supported
                    by the psychiatrists concerned). We pause to observe that it is <em>not</em> sufficient – in order for the Respondent to
                    succeed in his argument – that the Respondent was conscious of the fact
                    that he was misappropriating the items concerned although he could not help
                    himself. His argument – we reiterate – was premised on <em>a total absence of consciousness of all of his actions and their
                        respective consequences</em>. This is an important point which, as we
                    shall see, was before the judge during the criminal proceedings in the Hong Kong
                    District Court and (more importantly) which he took into account in <em>both</em> accepting the Respondent’s plea of guilt
                        <em>and</em> in sentencing him. Let us
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In arriving at his decision in the criminal
                    proceedings in the Hong Kong District Court, it is clear, in our view, that
                    District Judge Patrick Li (“DJ Li”) did, in fact, take into
                    account the psychiatric evidence tendered on behalf of the Respondent. This is
                    evident from the Reasons for Sentence (“the RS”) delivered by the
                    learned judge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In particular,
                    DJ Li noted, first, as follows (see the RS at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Bruce, S.C [counsel for the Respondent] <em>concedes</em> that <em>the [Respondent] does not
                            seek to dispute any elements of the offence. The [Respondent] admits his
                            guilt</em>. Mr. Bruce, S.C, however, submits that the
                        [Respondent] was suffering from <em>Major</em>
                        Depressive Disorder at the time of the offence. <em>This
                            condition affects his judgement and awareness of his conduct. He urges
                            this court to treat this case as exceptional and adopt a rehabilitation
                            approach in sentencing. He seeks to persuade me to consider community
                            service order or a suspended sentence</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The learned judge then proceeded to consider
                    the evidence of the psychiatrists (<em>viz</em>, Dr Ng
                    and Dr Lo) who were called to give evidence in mitigation on behalf of the
                    Respondent (which clearly stated (in both their respective medical reports as
                    well as on cross-examination by counsel for the Prosecution) the
                    Respondent’s position to the effect that he had absolutely no recollection
                    of picking up the items). His summary of this evidence was both succinct,
                    accurate and (as we shall see) significant (see the RS at [6]–[7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Two psychiatrists
                            are called to give evidence in mitigation:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Dr. Ng examined the [Respondent] four
                                times and submitted two reports. Dr. Ng opined that the
                                [Respondent] was in a state of disturbed consciousness <em>and was not fully aware of what he was
                                doing</em>. The [Respondent] was in heightened anxiety. His
                                conduct may appear to a third party to be rational and deliberate
                                whilst internally he was <em>not fully aware of his
                                    behaviour</em>. Dr. Ng diagnosed that the
                                [Respondent] was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. He
                                pointed out that taking items from several locations were consistent
                                with this diagnosis. <em>The removal of the SIM card
                                    from the mobile phone was an attempt to escape from
                                    guilt</em>. Dr. Ng recommended psychiatric treatment
                                and medication. The prognosis is excellent.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Dr. Lo also examined the [Respondent] four
                                times and submitted 2 reports. He concluded that the
                                [Respondent] was suffering from Major Depressive Disorder.
                                Dr. Lo pointed out that the [Respondent's] conduct appeared to
                                be rational and deliberate, however, his mind was impaired <em>and he was not fully aware of what he was doing and the
                                    consequence of his conduct</em>. Dr. Lo recommended
                                treatment but the prognosis is fair. Dr. Lo pointed out that
                                the taking of items from various places in a small hotel room is not
                                inconsistent with the conduct of a person suffering from depression.
                                    <em>Further, the removal of the SIM card from the
                                    mobile phone and the throwing of all items under his bed are
                                    irrational conducts seeking release of mental anguish by a
                                    depressed person</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Both psychiatrists examined the
                            [Respondent’s] diary, letters from his friends and colleague. I do
                            not propose to repeat the content of any of them here. Suffice it to
                            mention that they revealed a long period of mental stress starting from
                            mid-2005. There were escalating stress at work, tension in family and
                            expectations of a career. The [Respondent] eventually sought advice from
                            closed friends and his church pastor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is significant to note, at this juncture,
                    that DJ Li was <em>fully cognizant</em> of the
                    evidence of the psychiatrists – not least to the effect that the
                    Respondent was not, as a result of the Respondent’s medical condition,
                        “<em>fully aware</em> of what he was <em>doing</em>”
                    <em>and</em> (in the opinion of Dr Lo at least) of
                    “the <em>consequence</em> of his conduct”
                    (see the extract of the RS reproduced in the preceding paragraph (emphasis
                    added)). He was also fully cognizant of the evidence resulting from the
                    cross-examination of both psychiatrists by counsel for the Prosecution –
                    especially with regard to this particular issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In point of fact, therefore, the learned judge
                    had before him all the relevant psychiatric evidence and, if he was of the view
                    that the Respondent had in fact been acting in a “robotic” state
                    or (to put it another way) in a state of “automatism” (thus
                    negativing, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, any element of dishonest
                    intent whatsoever), DJ Li would <em>not</em> have
                    accepted the Respondent’s plea of guilt. As it turned out, the learned
                    judge <em>was</em> of the view that the Respondent’s
                    mental state <em>had</em> an effect –
                    <em>but only</em> with regard to <em>mitigation</em> of <em>the sentence</em> that
                    was to be meted out. Whilst acknowledging <em>the
                        Respondent’s</em> argument that “[he] <em>could not recall</em> how he took the items” (see the RS at
                    [8] (emphasis added)), it was clear that DJ Li did <em>not</em> accept this argument from “robotism” or
                    “automatism”. Whilst noting that he was “loath to differ
                    from the expert psychiatrists who spent years in the field” (see the RS
                    at [11]), it was clear that, whilst cognizant of the full scope of the
                    psychiatric evidence presented on behalf of the Respondent, the learned judge
                    was <em>not</em> convinced with respect to the <em>entire</em> diagnosis proffered by both doctors in favour of
                    the Respondent. As DJ Li observed (see the RS at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having considered the above, I accept the opinion of the psychiatrists. I
                        accept that the [Respondent] was suffering from <em>moderate</em> degree of depression. He was <em>not
                            fully aware</em> of <em>the consequence</em>
                        of his conduct. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following exchange between the learned judge and Dr Ng is
                    also, in our view, instructive and is consistent with the learned judge’s
                        findings:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is clear that the learned judge was of the
                    view that the Respondent was suffering from a Major Depressive Episode of only a
                    moderate degree of severity which did <em>not</em>,
                    therefore, go so far as to render him a “robot” or an
                    “automaton”. In other words, DJ Li was of the view that the
                    Respondent <em>did</em> know what he was doing. Put simply,
                    the ingredients of the offence of burglary (including that of dishonest intent)
                        <em>had</em>, in the learned judge’s view, been
                    established, although he did take into account the Respondent’s medical
                    condition in determining what sentence to mete out to the Respondent. Indeed,
                    DJ Li observed thus (see the RS at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the victim could not be definite, the [Respondent] recalled that the
                        door was half opened. In fact, there was no [prising open] of the room door.
                        I gave the [Respondent] the benefit of the doubt. In my view, the
                        circumstances were akin to an opportunistic burglar. This warrants a
                        departure from the tariff and a lower starting point in sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Returning to the issue of sentence, it is
                    clear that DJ Li was extremely merciful and compassionate in meting out the
                    sentence he did because of the Respondent’s medical condition. In the
                    learned judge’s view (see the RS at [13]–[14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    The [Respondent] has a good background. He is a
                            successful counsel earning an annual income of about $500,000
                            Singaporean currency. He has high professional standing and is of
                            impeccable character before the incident. It does not pay him to take
                            such a great risk and gain so little. There is no explanation except a
                            diseased mind that contributed to his conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    While burglary attracts immediate custodial
                            sentence under normal circumstances, this case is
                        exceptional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     And, after having made the observations
                    reproduced above (at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>), DJ Li
                    delivered the following sentence (see the RS at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    Having considered the background of the
                            [Respondent] and the authorities, I take 18 months as the starting
                            point, 6 months discount for his plea, I sentence the [Respondent]
                            to 12 months imprisonment. Bearing in mind the exceptional
                            circumstances, I suspend the imprisonment for
                        2 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the circumstances, it is clear, in our
                    view, that significant weight ought to be placed upon the Hong Kong conviction.
                    We pause to observe that the additional psychiatric evidence adduced on behalf
                    of the Respondent in respect of the present proceedings is, with respect,
                    unhelpful inasmuch as the psychiatrist concerned (albeit the Respondent’s
                    personal psychiatrist) focuses, in the main, on the reports by the Hong Kong
                    psychiatrists (see above at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> And the
                    subsequent reports by the Hong Kong psychiatrists which were obtained,
                    presumably by way of updates,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> merely restate what was in
                    the respective psychiatrists’ original reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having regard to the Hong Kong conviction, we
                    arrive at the conclusion that the Respondent was, in fact, guilty of dishonesty
                    although, as pointed out by DJ Li, there were powerful mitigating factors
                    that stemmed from the Respondent’s medical condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having considered all the circumstances
                    (including the fact that the Respondent was in fact guilty of dishonesty), we
                    find the Respondent guilty of the Amended charge. And, as we shall see below,
                    the element of dishonesty would be of particular significance in the context of
                    the sanction that should be imposed on the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is appropriate to observe, by way of a
                    coda, that the Respondent (who represented himself in the proceedings before the
                    Hong Kong Tribunal) adopted (as also alluded to above) a similar approach before
                    the Hong Kong Tribunal in so far as he sought to argue that his conduct had not
                    been dishonest and only changed his mind later; as the Hong Kong Tribunal
                    observed in its Statement of Findings (“the SOF”) (at
                        [4]–[5]):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Initially the Respondent indicated that he did not
                            admit to the Complaint, although he agreed to a number of facts and did
                            not challenge the authenticity of the information and evidence advanced
                            by the Applicant. Essentially, his case was that he had no dishonesty
                            during the events which constituted the burglary offence he was charged
                            in the criminal case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    At the substantive hearing before the Tribunal on
                                17<sup>th</sup> December 2009, after addressing
                            the Tribunal in the opening, he informed the Tribunal that he changed
                            his attitude to the Complaint to that of admission and would no longer
                            assert that he did not have dishonesty at the time of committing the
                            criminal offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Indeed, during the disciplinary proceedings in
                    Hong Kong, the Respondent sought to interpret DJ Li’s Reasons for
                    Sentence in a manner that was wholly contrary to that adopted by this court
                    – arguing, in essence, that the learned judge had, by accepting the
                    evidence of the psychiatrists during the criminal proceedings, also accepted
                    that the Respondent was a complete “robot” or
                    “automaton” in so far as the alleged misappropriation of the items
                    was concerned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Applicant (the
                    Law Society of Hong Kong) adopted – not surprisingly – a completely
                    contrary view, which was very similar to that adopted by this court and which
                    pointed out (correctly, in our view) that the Respondent was, in effect,
                    mounting a collateral attack on the Hong Kong conviction).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It suffices for the
                    purposes of the present proceedings to state that the stance adopted by the
                    Respondent was wholly without merit as it was not only a “creative
                    interpretation” of the learned judge’s Reasons for Sentence but
                    would also have rendered DJ Li’s Reasons for Sentence (as set out and
                    explained above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>) both illogical as well as incoherent.
                    Indeed, the Hong Kong Tribunal itself was confused by the approach that the
                    Respondent had initially adopted as the latter appeared to be arguing – at
                    one and the same time – that he had voluntarily pleaded guilty to a
                    criminal charge involving dishonesty and yet was not dishonest for the purpose
                    of the disciplinary proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> However, as the Hong
                    Kong Tribunal noted (see the preceding paragraph), the Respondent ultimately
                    admitted that he was dishonest after the Chairman of the Hong Kong Tribunal had
                    asked him the following question (which he (the Respondent) then answered in the
                        affirmative):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So your position now is no longer that you were not dishonest at the time
                        of the offence but then you may be submitting on the degree of
                        dishonesty?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the event, the Hong Kong Tribunal held, as
                    follows (see the SOF at [9]–[14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    It is hardly open to the Respondent to challenge
                            the [Law Society of Hong Kong] to prove he was dishonest at the time of
                            the offence. He was convicted on his own plea and admission of facts.
                            Under section 62 of the Evidence Ordinance, which applies to
                            proceedings before the Tribunal under rule 35 of the Solicitors
                            Disciplinary Tribunal Proceedings Rules, it befalls on the Respondent to
                            prove that he actually did not commit the burglary offence, which
                            entailed an element of dishonesty on the part of the Respondent. The
                            Tribunal could see great force in the submission by Ms. Maggie
                            Wong, Counsel for the [Law Society of Hong Kong], that the conviction
                            was virtually conclusive against the Respondent unless he could point to
                            special circumstances justifying an argument otherwise. See [<u>Re a Solicitor]</u>, CO/3076/95,
                                27<sup>th</sup> February 1996, Queen's Bench

                            pointed out any special circumstances nor proved that he was not
                            dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    The offence of burglary committed by the
                            Respondent is very serious hence constituted disgraceful, dishonourable
                            and discreditable conduct on his part. The Tribunal therefore finds the
                            Complaint against the Respondent proved.</p>

<b><u>REASONS AND
                            ORDER</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    The Tribunal has considered the Respondent's
                            mitigation submissions. At the time of the offence, he was suffering
                            from serious depression and did not know the consequences of his
                            actions. Since the conviction, he has returned to Singapore, where he
                            originated. There he took active steps to have his mental condition
                            treated. He has followed his doctors' recommendations and taken the
                            necessary treatments. He has substantially recovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    Normally, in relation to a case of misconduct by a
                            solicitor concerning an offence involving dishonesty, the Tribunal
                            should pass the sanction of striking off. However, having carefully
                            considered the submissions by the Respondent and the psychiatrists'
                            reports he produced, the Tribunal is prepared to consider this case an
                            exceptional one. He was labouring under mental depression when he
                            committed the offence and has taken active and effective steps to
                            receive treatment. He has taken the conscientious approach of not
                            resuming legal work pending treatment of his mental
                        condition.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Whilst we sympathise with the plight of the
                    Respondent in relation to his medical condition, this was (as noted above) only
                    relevant in the context of the mitigation of the sentences meted out against him
                    in the various proceedings. As we have already explained above, however, not
                    only was the Hong Kong conviction completely in order, the sentence meted out
                    was <em>more than</em> reasonable in the circumstances
                        <em>and</em> clearly demonstrated that the learned
                    judge had <em>more than</em> taken into account the
                    Respondent’s mental state at that particular point in time. Legal
                    principles were also accompanied (where applicable) by no small measure of mercy
                    in appropriate circumstances. Indeed, we are of the view that both the Hong Kong
                    District Court (in the context of the criminal proceedings against the
                    Respondent) and the Hong Kong Tribunal (in the context of the disciplinary
                    proceedings against the Respondent) were more than merciful and compassionate.
                    As already noted above, the Respondent was only given a suspended sentence in
                    the context of the criminal proceedings (see above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>) and was only suspended from practice (and not struck off
                    the roll of advocate and solicitors in Hong Kong) in the context of the
                    disciplinary proceedings (see the preceding paragraph). It is therefore
                    unfortunate that the Respondent sought to mount a root and branch attack on the
                    source of the various disciplinary proceedings brought against him both here as
                    well as in Hong Kong, <em>viz</em>, the Hong Kong
                    conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate sanction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We turn now to the appropriate sanction to be
                    imposed on the Respondent. In this regard, the relevant precedents are clear.
                    Where the advocate and solicitor concerned has been guilty of dishonesty, the
                    court will almost invariably, no matter how strong the mitigating factors
                    advanced by the advocate and solicitor, order that he or she be struck off the
                    roll (see, for example, the decisions of this court in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Amdad Hussein Lawrence</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 23 (“<em>Amdad Hussein
                        Lawrence</em>”); <em>Law Society of Singapore v
                        Ong Lilian</em> [2005] SGHC 187 (“<em>Ong Lilian</em>”); and <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Ezekiel Caleb Charles James</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 256 (“<em>Ezekiel Caleb Charles
                        James</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Work pressure or stress should never be an
                    excuse for a lawyer to act dishonestly. Reference may be made to another
                    decision of this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Wee Wei
                        Fen</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 559 (“<em>Wee
                        Wei Fen</em>”), which involved blatant acts of dishonesty.
                    Although there was some indication that the advocate and solicitor concerned was
                    suffering from depression, her primary ailment really centred (unlike the
                    present case) on work stress, to which the court in that case responded as
                    follows (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a fact that most lawyers work under constant pressure and it is only
                        inevitable that stress levels are high in the workplace. In fact, it is this
                        sort of environment which provides the dynamism and efficiency with which
                        our legal system is well-known to function. Clearly it is not an excuse for
                        a lawyer to act dishonestly and fraudulently simply because he or she could
                        not cope with the demands of work. While mere slip-ups or inadvertence may
                        in situations be condonable, the same cannot be said of a series of
                        deliberate acts of deceit committed over a period of more than a few months,
                        which acts gravely compromised the interests of the solicitor's clients. It
                        cannot be over-emphasised that the function of any disciplinary tribunal is
                        to uphold the good name of the profession and to ensure that that name is
                        not tarnished by the aberrant actions of a mere handful who cross the line.
                        In addition, the court has also to be mindful of the exceedingly compelling
                        interest of protecting those members of the public who find need to use the
                        services of the profession. That no benefit whatsoever accrued to the lawyer
                        through his or her acts is also of no relevance to the question of what is
                        the appropriate order to be imposed when all the offences clearly involved
                        an element of dishonesty …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may also be made, in this regard, to <em>Amdad Hussein Lawrence</em> (at [15]–[16]); <em>Ong Lilian</em> (at [12]); and <em>Ezekiel Caleb
                        Charles James</em> (at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Admittedly, what the Respondent was suffering
                    from here went beyond mere work stress and the dishonest act was a single
                    episode, unlike the conduct of the advocate and solicitor in <em>Wee Wei Fen</em> where there was a series of deliberate acts of
                    deceit committed over a period of more than a few months. However, that does not
                    excuse the fact that the Respondent’s conduct was dishonest. The
                    precedents have clearly established that even a single act of dishonesty may
                    result in the advocate and solicitor being struck off the roll. In <em>Ong Lilian</em>, the solicitor was struck of the roll because
                    she had been convicted of one count of theft in a dwelling place under
                    s 380 of the Penal Code. The court observed (at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We recognise that the total value of the items which the
                        respondent stole in the present case was not large and she was only
                        sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. While the penalty imposed by
                        the criminal court is a relevant consideration (see <em>Wee
                            Wei Fen</em><a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em> at [32]), and would go to show how
                        gravely the trial court viewed the offence, it is not determinative of how a
                        disciplinary body, like this court, should view the misconduct, especially
                        where dishonesty was clearly present. In our opinion, the following passage
                        from <em>Wee Wei Fen</em> at [39] is an accurate
                        reflection of the position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]n a case where the court is bound to consider the appropriate order
                            to be made in respect of an advocate and solicitor convicted of a
                            criminal offence – particularly one involving dishonesty –
                            the paramount considerations must be that of the protection of the
                            public and the preservation of the good name of the profession.
                            Certainly the court will give its consideration to the mitigating
                            circumstances in each individual case but it can do so only so far as is
                            consistent with the above two related objectives: see <em>Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam</em>, supra at p 537. In
                                <em>Tham Yu Xian Rick</em>, we held, following
                                <em>Bolton v Law Society</em>, supra at
                            p 492, that considerations which ordinarily weigh in mitigation of
                            punishment have less effect on the exercise of the disciplinary
                            jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in criminal cases as show cause
                            proceedings are primarily civil and not punitive in nature. In any case,
                            the weight to be attached to a plea in mitigation in disciplinary
                            proceedings is negligible where the case is one involving proven
                            dishonesty, as striking off will often be the consequence as a matter of
                            course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Similarly, in <em>Amdad Hussein
                        Lawrence</em>, the respondent, an advocate and solicitor of
                    15 years’ standing, pleaded guilty to and was convicted of a single
                    count of theft in a dwelling place under s 380 of the Penal Code. He stole
                    $478.50 worth of items, including a VCD player, VCDs, food items and a toy from
                    a supermarket. He was sentenced to two months imprisonment. During the
                    disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that the fact that the Respondent was
                    suffering from stress and was under medication at the time of the offence had
                    negligible weight as the offence involved proven dishonesty. The Court ordered
                    the Respondent to be struck of the roll and observed thus (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    In the criminal proceedings against the respondent,
                            medical reports were tendered in mitigation, suggesting that the
                            respondent's higher mental functioning, judgment and impulse control
                            could have been affected or impaired by the effects of the medication
                            which were taken prior to the incident. Nonetheless, it was not disputed
                            that the respondent possessed the specific intent and retained the
                            ability to distinguish between right and wrong at the material time.
                                <em>In our view, the weight to be accorded to this
                                mitigating factor was negligible when the offence involved proven
                                dishonesty</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Admittedly, each case ought to be decided on
                    its own facts. For example, in the present proceedings, the fact situation
                    appears to be somewhat different inasmuch as the Respondent’s mental
                    function appears to have been relatively more impaired than that of the advocate
                    and solicitor in <em>Amdad Hussein Lawrence</em> although,
                    to the extent that we have found that the Respondent was aware of what he was
                    doing, there is (to that extent) some similarity with the facts of that same
                    case. However, in sentencing the Respondent, the more severe mental condition of
                    the Respondent carries little weight since the offence for which the Respondent
                    was convicted involved dishonesty (in contrast to, for example, the conduct of
                    the advocate and solicitor in the decision of this court in <em>Chiong Chin May Selena</em> (where the advocate and solicitor
                    concerned was not struck off the roll but was, instead, suspended from practice
                    for one year)). However, as we shall see below (at [52]–[53]), the
                    relatively more severe mental condition the Respondent was suffering from may
                    have a possible bearing with regard to <em>the
                    future</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The aim here is not to punish the Respondent
                    for his conduct. This task has been performed by the criminal proceedings in
                    Hong Kong. Rather, we have the task of determining whether the Respondent has
                    been guilty of such conduct that makes him unfit to be a member of the legal
                    profession. In sentencing solicitors in such circumstances as the present, a
                    court must keep in mind the need to preserve the good name of the profession and
                    the protection of the public. At this juncture, it will be appropriate to repeat
                    the observations of this Court in <em>Re Knight Glenn
                        Jeyasingam</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 366 (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">More importantly, in our view, in any case where the court is
                        bound to consider the appropriate order to be made in respect of an advocate
                        and solicitor convicted of a criminal offence – particularly one
                        involving dishonesty –
                        <em>the paramount considerations must be the protection of

                            Certainly the court will give its consideration to the mitigating
                            circumstances in each individual case but it can do so only so far as is
                            consistent with the above two related objectives</em>. As the Law
                        Society of the United Kingdom noted in its <em>Guide to the
                            Professional Conduct of Solicitors</em> (1990 Ed) at
                        p 177:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If the need to protect the good name of the profession ultimately
                            causes hardship to an individual whose misconduct has led to his being
                            struck off, it has to be accepted as the price of maintaining the
                            reputation of the profession and the public confidence in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The legal profession cannot be seen to be
                    tolerant of any act of dishonesty on the part of an advocate and solicitor, even
                    if the dishonesty has been of a technical nature (such as in the present case).
                    We also bear in mind the following observations of this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 266 (at [12]–[13]), which were in fact applied in both
                        <em>Amdad Hussein Lawrence</em> and <em>Ong Lilian</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    There are also the interests of the honourable
                            profession to which the solicitor belongs, and those of the courts
                            themselves, to consider. The administration of justice can only proceed
                            on the basis that solicitors can place reliance upon the honesty of the
                            solicitors with whom they deal. The public too must be able to repose
                            confidence in a profession which plays so indispensable a part in the
                            administration of justice. Similarly, the courts of this country must be
                            able to depend on the honesty and integrity of all practitioners
                            appearing before them and to expect that they will maintain the highest
                            standards of personal honesty and integrity in their dealings with the
                            courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    There is therefore a serious responsibility on the
                            court, a duty to itself, to the rest of the profession and to the whole
                            of the community, to be careful not to accredit any person as worthy of
                            public confidence and therefore fit to practise as an advocate and
                            solicitor who cannot satisfactorily establish his right to those
                            credentials. In the end therefore, the question to be determined is
                            whether the solicitor in question is a fit and proper person to be an
                            advocate and solicitor of the court, and the orders to be made are to be
                            directed to ensuring that, to the extent that he is not, his practice is
                            restricted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the circumstances, we order that the
                    Respondent be struck off the roll and that he bear the costs of the proceedings
                    both here and below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, in view of the special mitigating
                    circumstances with respect to the Hong Kong conviction (centring on the
                    Respondent’s mental depression at the material time), we are of the view
                    that it is quite likely that such conduct on the part of the Respondent will not
                    be repeated (we note, in this regard, the numerous testimonials on behalf of the
                    Respondent, expressing shock and disbelief at what, in their view, was very
                    uncharacteristic conduct on the part of the Respondent). In the circumstances,
                    the Respondent could possibly apply for reinstatement to the roll within a
                    relatively short period of time (in accordance with the principles laid down by
                    this court, in particular, in <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v Law
                        Society of Singapore</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 704
                        (“<em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam</em>”);
                        <em>Narindar Singh Kang v Law Society of Singapore</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 641; <em>Gnaguru s/o Thamboo Mylvaganam
                        v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1; and
                        <em>Kalpanath Singh s/o Ram Raj Singh v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1018). However, as Chan Sek
                    Keong CJ, delivering the grounds of decision of this court in <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam</em> observed (at
                    [11]–[12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Although s 102 does not provide that a minimum
                            period of time should have elapsed before an applicant may seek to be
                            restored as an advocate and solicitor, <em>it is a
                                well-established rule that a significantly longer period than five
                                years should have passed before he should consider making such an
                                application</em>: <em>Re Chan Chow
                                Wang</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 55; <em>Re Lim Cheng Peng</em> [1987] SLR(R) 582; <em>Re Nirmal Singh s/o Fauja Singh</em> [2001]
                            2 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Re Nirmal
                                Singh</em>”); and <em>Re Gnaguru s/o Thamboo Mylvaganam</em>
                            [2004] SGHC 180.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    
              <em>The reason for this rule is that
                                under s 83(1) of the LPA, the maximum period for which a lawyer
                                may be suspended is five years, and a striking off should normally
                                be more serious than a suspension. The courts have accordingly held
                                that while an application for restoration to the roll might be made
                                at any time, such an application would not be entertained unless it
                                was made after a period significantly longer than five years from
                                the time when the applicant was struck off the roll. He or she ought
                                not to be placed in substantially the same position as one who has
                                been suspended for the maximum period of five years under
                                s 83(1) of the LPA</em>: see [13] of <em>Re Nirmal Singh</em>. The overriding concern is that the
                            application should not be made prematurely, having regard to the nature
                            of the criminal or disciplinary offences that led to the applicant's
                            disbarment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the reasons aforesaid, this appears to be an exceptional case
                    where the element of dishonesty manifested by the Respondent was in a one-off
                    case at a time when he was under some psychological stress. We also note that
                    the fact that the Respondent had voluntarily ceased practice may also be taken
                    into account in appropriate circumstances (see <em>Knight Glenn
                        Jeyasingam</em> (at [14]–[17])). In the circumstances, it seems
                    to us that the normal waiting period before a solicitor who is struck off for
                    dishonest conduct may apply for reinstatement as enunciated in <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam</em>, <em>ie</em>, a period <em>significantly longer</em>
                    than five years, may not be appropriate in the context of the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Further, whether the Respondent is successful
                    in such an application will obviously depend on all the circumstances of the
                    case at that particular point in time (including the fact as to whether he has
                    recovered from his medical condition and is able to practise law again and, if
                    so, whether appropriate constraints on the extent of his practice ought also to
                    be imposed).</p>
