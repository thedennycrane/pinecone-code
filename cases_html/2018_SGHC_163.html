It was determined via adjudication with the Singapore Mediation Centre (AA495/2016) that the payment response purportedly served on 28 December 2016 was out of time and as such was invalid under s 11 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (“SOPA”) (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed). The adjudicator found for the plaintiff in the total sum of $1,077,151.37 including costs but excluding interests. The adjudication determination was dated 17 February 2017 and served on the parties on the same day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the first defendant on 21 February 2017 to demand payment of the adjudication amount. The first defendant refused to pay on the ground that it was entitled to set-off certain sums owed. The plaintiff’s solicitors issued another letter on 24 February 2017 demanding payment, following which they applied for and obtained an enforcement order for the first defendant to pay the sums awarded under the adjudication determination (“the enforcement order”). The enforcement order was obtained on 28 February 2017 and served on the first defendant on 3 March 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The first defendant commenced arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff on 3 March 2017 by filing a notice of arbitration for the sum of $1.55m in liquidated damages for late completion of the subcontract. The arbitration proceedings were still pending at the time of the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The first defendant also filed an application on 17 March 2017 to set aside the enforcement order. The application was dismissed after the hearing on 24 May 2017, and on 8 June 2017 the plaintiff received $1,072,519.20 which was the sum that the first defendant had paid into court. There was further correspondence after this point as to whether the first defendant was liable for further payments of interest.

In the case of <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Am Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 3 SLR 352 (“<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span>”), the Court of Appeal established various guiding principles on the circumstances under which a finding of unconscionability can be made, which principles shall be summarised here briefly. <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>similarly involved the call on an on-demand performance bond in advance of an arbitration hearing on liquidated damages for late completion of construction works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Whereas the boundaries of unconscionability cannot and should not be precisely delineated (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [35]–[38]), it is generally uncontroversial that the concept covers acts involving abuse, unfairness and dishonesty (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [19], <span class="font-italic">GHL Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 44). It has also been said that unconscionable conduct is “conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith that a court of conscience would either restrain the party or refuse to assist the party” (<span class="font-italic">Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong </span>[1996] SGHC 136 at [5]). It is clear that unconscionability would extend to facts not amounting to a finding of fraud, and as such is broader than the notion of fraud (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [23]). That being said, it has also been cautioned that whilst unfairness is an important consideration in establishing whether there is unconscionability, not every instance of unfairness would amount to unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 198 (“<span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span>”) at [30]). Further, the existence of genuine disputes between the parties is not sufficient <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to constitute unconscionability <span class="font-italic">(Mount Sophia </span>at [42], <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32], <span class="font-italic">LQS </span><span class="font-italic">Construction Pte Ltd v Mencast Marine Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] 3 SLR 404 at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Apart from the factors that might justify a finding of unconscionability, it is also important to keep in mind the threshold for establishing its existence. It is undeniable on the one hand that abusive and oppressive calls may result not only in the beneficiary (in this case the first defendant) gaining an undeserved windfall but also severely curtail the liquidity of the obligor (here the plaintiff), and that this would have considerable adverse consequences for players in the construction industry (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [27], <span class="font-italic">JBE</span><span class="font-italic"> Properties Pte Ltd v Gammon Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 47 (“<span class="font-italic">JBE”</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]). On the other hand, courts should also be slow to disturb the allocation of risk bargained for by commercially-minded parties, particularly since the nature of the performance bond might have been reflected in the bid price or other contractual terms (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [25], <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30]). The settled law, having regard to these competing interests, is one that strikes the necessary balance by requiring a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability before the threshold for curial intervention is met. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [20]–[21] bear repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Simply put, the threshold is a high one, and the burden that the applicant has to discharge is to demonstrate a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability […] When determining if a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case has been made out, the entire context of the case must be thoroughly considered, and it is only if the entire context of the case is particularly malodorous that such an injunction should be granted. We must emphasise that the courts’ discretion to grant such injunctions must be sparingly exercised and it should not be an easy thing for an applicant to establish a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Lastly, it should be kept in mind that a court hearing an application to restrain the call on a performance bond is not obliged to undertake a protracted examination of the merits of the case or to decide on substantive entitlements of the parties to enforce their rights, but rather that it should consider whether the overall tenor and context of the parties’ conduct point to a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of the Performance Bond</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Although the parties appear to be largely in agreement as to the nature of the Performance Bond, I propose nonetheless to deal with this issue briefly, as a proper evaluation of the parties’ rights and obligations thereunder would assist in the assessment of whether the first defendant had acted unconscionably.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In this regard, it is clear that the construction of the terms and nature of an instrument such as the Performance Bond depends not on the label adopted by the parties but the substance of the rights and obligations established by its terms. The following quote from <span class="font-italic">JBE </span>at [17], cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>(at [3]), is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The threshold question for the purposes of ascertaining the nature of the Bond is whether, on a true construction of that instrument, the Bank was liable to pay on demand, or only later, upon proof of breach by [the contractor-obligor] and loss by [the employer-beneficiary]. The construction process looks to the substance of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Bond; the label adopted by the parties is inconclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In the present case, the relevant terms of the Performance Bond,

Even though there is a reference in the recital portion of the Performance Bond to the underlying subcontract between the first defendant and the plaintiff, this clearly does not suffice to incorporate any conditions that may exist in that subcontract into the present Performance Bond (see <span class="font-italic">Bocotra</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd and others v Attorney-General</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 262 at [22]–[26]). Hence, the first defendant is not expressly required to establish any breach on the part of the plaintiff before calling on the Performance Bond, although this does not preclude the court from restraining the call if it is unconscionable (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the call on the Performance Bond unconscionable?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Having considered the submissions of both parties, I found that the plaintiff has not proven a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability on the first defendant’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Whereas the plaintiff took pains to emphasise that the call was made almost two years after the completion of the contracted works and that this showed the call to be “radical and drastic”, it is clear that the first defendant had consistently asserted its right to liquidated damages for late completion during this period, and that the call on the Performance Bond was merely the latest step taken in a series of conduct aimed at recuperating in part the losses that the first defendant might have incurred from the late completion. Given the unconditional nature of the Performance Bond, the fact that the plaintiff denied having been in breach of its stipulated contractual completion date amounts at most to a genuine dispute between parties which cannot justify a finding of unconscionability <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The plaintiff argued that the call was abusive as it was a retaliatory attempt by the first defendant to “claw back” the amount paid to the plaintiff pursuant to the adjudication determination, after the first defendant failed to set aside the enforcement order on 24 May 2017. I was not convinced that the first defendant’s decision to make the call some five months after the court order of 24 May 2017 lends much support to the plaintiff’s argument. Whereas the plaintiff painted a picture of the first defendant consistently withholding payment of sums owed and acting in an uncooperative manner, I did not think that the totality of the evidence presented before me supported this depiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The first defendant’s explanation for the timing of the call was that it had chosen to call after assessing the plaintiff’s defence filed in the arbitration proceedings. It is not for this court to assess whether or not this was a prudent or reasonable legal strategy – I was convinced that this was a plausible reason for the timing of the call which would go towards debunking the plaintiff’s allegation that the call could only have been made in bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff’s argument that the first defendant’s untimely call would effectively circumvent the existing arbitration proceedings is similarly untenable. Given the nature of the Performance Bond, there is no obligation for the first defendant to stay its hands until the dispute is disposed of via arbitration – in fact doing so would very much defeat the purpose of the Performance Bond, which was presumably contracted for so that the first defendant had the option of having some cash in hand without first having to prove its case for damages before a court or tribunal. As such, the mere fact that the call took place prior to any arbitral award cannot constitute unfairness. Whereas the plaintiff had asserted repeatedly during the course of the hearing that it is an under-capitalised “small player” in the construction industry, there was no evidence that it would be prevented from mounting a defence in the ongoing arbitration proceedings by virtue of the call.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiff had also argued that the first defendant’s call was unconscionable as it has not shown that it has suffered loss, citing <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as authority.

</div> The plaintiff’s argument and reliance on <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>however is flawed. In <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span>, the Court of Appeal faced an appeal against a partial restraint of a call on a performance bond, and further reduced the amount of the bond called such that the amount was not unconscionable, having regard to progress payments already made and losses actually suffered. Hence, <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>stands for the proposition that a court in exercising its equitable jurisdiction of restraining a call on a performance bond on the ground of unconscionability is entitled to limit the restraint to only that part of the call that was clearly excessive. In other words, the nature of the equitable jurisdiction is not such that the court must either restrain the call completely or not at all, and the quantum of loss is a relevant factor in the assessment of whether a call should be restrained. The plaintiff however erroneously extrapolated from this proposition to argue that a beneficiary must first provide evidence of actual loss suffered before being entitled to call a performance bond in the first place, which is clearly an entirely different proposition. The mere fact that parties are in disagreement as to losses suffered cannot mean that the call was unconscionable (see above at [25]). In the present case, I have also considered the fact that the plaintiff had received full payment for sums owed under the subcontract, as well as the fact that an independent architect had certified the date of completion of the works and that the first defendant is liable to the employer for liquidated damages. All of these pointed to the fact that the first defendant made the call in order to recuperate liquidated damages which it legitimately believed to be owing, and was not motivated by any improper purpose or bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Having regard to the foregoing factors, I found that the plaintiff failed to discharge its burden to prove a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the first defendant had made the call on the Performance Bond unconscionably. As such, I declined to exercise my jurisdiction to restrain the call, and thus dismissed the plaintiff’s application and discharged the interim injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Costs here and before were fixed at $12,000 including disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">De Vaz Ian Marc Rosario, Tay Bing Wei and Chek Xinwei Liana (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Philip Antony Jeyaretnam SC, Melissa Thng Huilin and Amogh Nallan Chakravarti (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the first defendant;<br/>The second defendant unrepresented</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
