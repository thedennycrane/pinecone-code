LSI alleged that the representations induced it to enter into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) to buy 32,049 shares in Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd (“AMP”) from Goh for $14,422,050. On 24 November 2015, LSI proceeded to rescind the SPA. LSI now seeks a declaration that the SPA had been validly avoided and rescinded and for the return of its money and other reliefs. The defendants deny that they made the representations as claimed by LSI, and claimed that LSI has wrongfully rescinded the SPA and sought damages for wrongful rescission. At the end of the trial, LSI’s counsel, Mr Singh SC, stated that LSI would not be proceeding in its claim against Michelle.

Goh, a medical doctor, founded AMP in 2008 to operate his medical practice at Paragon Shopping Centre. He then incorporated Aesthetic Medical Holdings Pte Ltd (“AMH”) which operated a chain of clinics (“PPP Clinics”) to provide laser facial treatments. Around 2012, AMH became a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMP. Goh was the Group Executive Chairman of AMP from 6 January 2012 to 30 June 2014 and a director from 1 September 2008 to 2 February 2016. Michelle was the Chief Executive Officer and director of AMP, and a director of AMH, at the material time. Goh and Michelle have throughout remained shareholders of AMP.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Florence and Andy’s testimonies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In November 2013, Florence and Andy were introduced to Goh and Michelle in Shanghai by Nelson and Terence Loh (“Nelson” and “Terence”), who owned a minority shareholding in AMP through RSP Investments (“RSP”) and who were running a franchise of the PPP Clinic in China.  Florence and Andy subsequently acquired the franchise rights to operate a PPP Clinic in Suzhou, China (“PPP Suzhou”). In September 2014, Florence met Goh and Michelle for the second time when she<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>attended a training workshop organised by AMP. In early October 2014, Florence arranged to attend training sessions in Singapore conducted by AMP. PPP Suzhou was not doing very well and Florence was looking for a mentor to teach her business management and marketing skills. She thus began to correspond regularly with Goh whom she found to be an “excellent mentor” and whom she placed a “great amount of trust and confidence in”.

As the SPA deal had to be completed quickly, Florence and Andy did not have time to do due diligence on AMP. In addition to the guarantee on investment capital which Goh earlier suggested, Andy asked for an “internal rate of return” (“IRR”) of 15% per annum in order to protect their investment and to incentivise Goh to negotiate a trade sale price that was higher than the 15% IRR.

Further, around October 2014, Nelson had been discussing with Thomson Medical on a trade sale, and had informed Goh that the trade sale deal was near completion or “near final”.

AMP also spent a lot of time and resources on pre-listing work until March 2015. That AMP did not ultimately make a submission to SGX was a result of “a series of unfortunate events that made it difficult or even impossible for an IPO” and were beyond Goh’s control. This included the abrupt resignation of AMP’s Chief Financial Officer in March 2015, the attempt by some of AMP’s shareholders to remove Goh and Michelle from the board of directors in May/June 2015, and a suit commenced by one of AMP’s shareholders against Goh and Michelle in July 2015.

There must be a representation of fact, made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff. Next, the plaintiff must have acted upon the false statement and suffered damage by so doing. Finally, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false, it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v Compania de Navegacion Palomar, SA and others</span><span class="font-italic"> and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 894 (“<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez</span>”) at [172]–[173] the Court of Appeal stated that a representation as to the future is not, in itself, actionable, although it can imply an actionable representation. For instance, a person who makes a statement as to the future may make an implied representation of an existing fact. A person who states an intention as to the future may also implicitly represent that he in fact has that intention at the time of making the statement. Next, for the representation to be false, it must be <span class="font-italic">substantially </span>false. It need not be false in every respect, nor is it invariably sufficient if it is false in a single respect.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 An action under s 2(1) of the MA is premised on the representee entering into a contract with the representor. Once an actionable representation is established (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a false statement made by the representor to the representee and induces him to enter into the contract), the representor would be liable under s 2(1) of the MA unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did so believe in the truth of the representation (<span class="font-italic">Lim Koon Park and another v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another</span> [2013] 4 SLR 150 at [38]–[39]). Where an actionable misrepresentation is shown, a representor is liable for innocent misrepresentation.

</div> It is undisputed that Michelle was not present at the 23 October 2014 dinner or the 24 October 2014 meeting.

Goh claimed that he only told Florence that there were shareholders in AMP who were willing to sell their shares and Florence and Andy thus had the opportunity to purchase AMP shares. In addition to this, I find that Goh had informed Florence and Andy that there were minority shareholders with voting rights who could stifle a trade sale or an IPO, that he wanted to buy them out, and that he needed Florence’s and Andy’s financial support to do so as his money was stuck elsewhere. Hence, I accept that the Minority Shareholders Representation was made. This is supported by the contemporaneous documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Shortly after the dinner on 23 October 2014, Florence informed Andy that Goh was prepared to sell AMP shares which belonged to other shareholders. On 24 October 2014 (after Florence’s meeting with Goh that day) she again informed Andy that there were minority shareholders who “might hinder [Goh’s] work” and that Goh wanted to purchase the AMP shares from them.

</div> Florence would not have informed Andy of these matters unless Goh had conveyed them to her. Even on 23 November 2014, Goh told Florence that he could only release about 17,000 shares first, and that he needed her cash as soon as possible to buy AMP shares from most of the Minority Shareholders. Hence Goh added a clause in the SPA for the shares to be sold to LSI in two tranches.

When Florence stated in the email that she was informed that there was a 99% possibility of a trade sale and asked Goh why it did not happen, he did not refute this but instead stated that he also believed it! In court, Goh was evasive when asked why he did not reply to Florence’s question and assertion that she and Andy had been told there was a 99% possibility of a trade sale. He avoided the issue and claimed that “there was no reason to deny” and that he had answered the question in the email, but then stated that he was not responding to her assertion.

I also find that Goh had told Florence at the 24 October 2014 meeting that a trade sale would take place “very soon”. Whilst there were no documents to show that Goh had used the words “imminent” or “likely to take place within one month”, Goh had conveyed a sense of urgency regarding the stage of the trade sale deal. On 27 October 2014 (soon after the 23 October 2014 dinner), Goh asked Florence to decide quickly as “timing is of the essence [and] if the decision is not quick enough, we will just have to pass too”. On 24 November 2014 (a day before the SPA was signed) Goh informed Florence and/or Andy that he needed a “quick decision” and that they “need[ed] to move fast, as he need[ed] the money to take out a large [number] of minority shareholders with voting rights very quickly”. Goh also stated, “chances are that nobody need to guarantee anything once IPO or Trade Sales take place very soon”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To summarise, I find that before the SPA was executed, Goh had represented to Florence and/or Andy that: (a) AMP was working towards a liquidity event which included a trade sale of all its shares; (b) the trade sale was to an important person in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Peter Lim), who was a billionaire and owned a medical group or hospital chain; (c) there was a “99%” probability or possibility of the trade sale being concluded; and (d) the trade sale was a likely deal, it was imminent, it would likely take place within one month and it would take place very soon. I will refer to these as the Trade Sale Representations. The correspondences show that Goh was rushing the process of the sale of his shares and, to get Florence and/or Andy to execute the SPA quickly, he had conveyed to them the urgency of the matter by representing the imminence of a trade sale and the high chance of it being completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Moreover, I find that the Minority Shareholders Representation impliedly represented that the trade sale deal was imminent and highly likely.

Maybank did not appear to have been involved after 1 October 2014, and the HOA between AMP and Thomson Medical was still a draft at 8 October 2014. On 10 October 2014, Thomson Medical sent a long list of priority questions to AMP for the purposes of due diligence. This included a request for AMP’s audited accounts for the financial year 2014, which had not been prepared and was only ready in <span class="font-italic">September 2015</span>, some nine months after the SPA was executed.

When Nelson sent a second draft HOA from Thomson Medical to Goh on 12 October 2014 and informed him that “we are near final”, the HOA was still a draft and Goh was told that there were a “[c]ouple of outstanding points to discuss”.

Andrew opined that the due diligence, pricing discussions, negotiation and completion process for a trade sale would have required at least three more months and would have taken even longer for a company lacking the audited information for due diligence (such as AMP at the material time).

Goh produced a few emails between the two entities pertaining to continuing discussions of a trade sale, but it is unclear from these emails whether and what further activities took place to advance the trade sale or at what stage the trade sale deal was when Goh made the Trade Sale Representations.

Whether a representation is a puff would depend on the degree or obviousness of its untruth, the circumstances of its making and the expertise and knowledge attributable to the person to whom it is made (see <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank AG</span> at [87]). Unlike Goh, LSI’s representatives knew little or nothing about the trade sale negotiations or the proposed IPO and they had no access to information pertaining to AMP’s potential trade sale. The Trade Sale Representations were made to convince LSI to buy Goh’s shares in AMP. Hence, that Goh stated that the trade sale was a 99% probability or that it was imminent <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. would have been viewed by LSI as representing a high chance of a trade sale taking place and that it would take place very soon.

</div> Indeed, Goh claimed he did not find out the details of the potential trade sale, such as the price, the terms and conditions of the sale, the stage of negotiations, and even his involvement in the business post-trade sale. Goh’s conduct was puzzling in light of the fact that he claimed he was “interested” to know and “wanted to know a lot of things”, that he was then a director of AMP, and that he would stand to gain substantially if a trade sale materialised. Yet Goh claimed that he left it to Nelson to give him information if and when Nelson saw fit, and he did not see the need to enquire about the status of the trade sale deal.

</div> It was plain that Lee’s evidence that AMP’s board (including Goh) would be updated and Goh’s admission that he had discussed items on Thomson Medical’s list of due diligence queries sat uneasily with Goh’s claim that he simply left such matters to others in AMP to handle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Indeed, I find that Goh knew the progress of the trade sale (or lack thereof) with Thomson Medical at the material time. In late October/early November 2014, Goh was a substantial shareholder of AMP, its founder and a director – it is unbelievable that he did not verify the status of the trade sale deal, even though he had access to the necessary information and claimed that he was “interested” to know, “wanted to know a lot of things” and would “love to know” how close the deal was to signing.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anna</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee</span> elaborated that this higher standard was because allegations of fraud carried grave implications of dishonesty on the part of the representor. Hence, whilst the standard of proof was one on a balance of probabilities, the more serious the allegation, the more evidence the representee may have to adduce to succeed in his claim (see <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co</span>) v <span class="font-italic">Lek Benedict and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Even so, I had no difficulty concluding that Goh had the necessary intent for a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation. Goh’s intent went beyond wilful blindness or recklessness. Goh claimed he did not know or was unconcerned about the status of the trade sale deal. If so, I could not see how he had any basis to represent that it was going to happen very soon, or by his own words, that it was a “likely deal”.  On the contrary, the evidence showed that Goh knew the status of the trade sale deal. Knowing the lack of progress, he was dishonest in stating that it would happen “very soon”, much less that it was imminent, highly likely or there was a 99% probability or possibility that it would happen. His dishonesty continued as he failed to correct, and persisted in repeating, the representations until the time LSI executed the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Inducement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Next, I find that Goh had intended the Trade Sale Representations to be acted upon by Florence and Andy (see also [49] above). By Goh’s evidence, he felt it would be worthwhile for them to invest in AMP and hence he informed Florence of the potential trade sale to a hospital chain. Goh admitted that he tried to persuade them to invest in AMP, that he was “interested” to have them invest in AMP, that he had asked Florence to persuade Andy to invest, and that he wanted their help to buy out minority shareholders.

This was reiterated by Lee to Maybank and Goh on 12 September 2014 that AMP was still proceeding on a dual track IPO and trade sale (though Lee also indicated AMP’s preferred choice to be a trade sale).

Indeed, Goh claimed that, before the SPA was executed, he did not verify the status of the re-auditing of financial statements or whether the FY2014 accounts could be audited in time for a June 2015 listing,

</div> Goh and Lee did not correct this statement. Instead, Goh confirmed that if the trade sale price was lower than their investment, the Guarantee would be engaged. Second, Goh had on 24 November 2014 reiterated to Florence that “chances are that nobody need to guarantee anything once IPO or trade sales take place very soon”. Goh continued to maintain that a trade sale would take place “very soon” although the one-month period had passed. Third, Goh admitted that, around 23 or 24 October 2014, he believed a trade sale would <span class="font-italic">likely</span> take place within one month. Finally, on 13 January 2015 (post-SPA), Goh reiterated to Florence that “Trade Sales deal is on” and “the Peter Lim deal is on tomorrow”.

Mr Lok SC claimed that as the Guarantee was built on the default of a liquidity event not occurring, LSI was “apathetic” about the possibility or timeframe of such event.

However it was a <span class="font-italic">non-sequitur</span> to suggest that because the Guarantee provided for the situation that a liquidity event would not occur within 24 months, and that Florence and Andy expended significant effort to procure the Guarantee, this meant that the possibilities of such an event occurring were “superfluous souvenirs” to them.

</div> That LSI relied on Goh’s representations when entering the SPA is reinforced by the very terms of the SPA – in clauses 4(iii), (iv) and (v), the parties provided first and foremost for a trade sale or an IPO materialising, including that the Guarantee would not apply if an IPO occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Trade Sale and IPO Representations were made alongside the parties’ negotiations on the Guarantee and must be considered together. Florence and Andy were attracted by what Goh (repeatedly) said and by the potential to make a quick and handsome profit. On 11 November 2014, Andy emailed Lee (copying Goh) to ask if AMP “is sold at a trade sale soon after [LSI’s] share purchase at a higher price, can [LSI] retain all the profits?” and further stated that “the principle of the guarantee” was to “make sure the management team has the incentive to drive the sale price above [LSI’s] cost [and] 15% IRR.” The Guarantee thus had to be read in the context of securing a foreseeable liquidity event. Hence whilst Florence and Andy relied on the representations, they also took the step to protect their investment via the Guarantee if the deal fell through. It must be recalled that Goh was pressing them for a quick decision and they had no opportunity to do due diligence of AMP. As Goh admitted, the Guarantee was thus important to them.

</div> – this potential, based on Goh’s representations of an imminent or 99% chance of a trade sale, would have had a material bearing on Florence’s and Andy’s decision to enter into the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I reiterate. I find that Florence and Andy would not have entered into the SPA if Goh had not made the representations. A substantial influence on their minds was the impression given that a liquidity event was imminent and highly likely (and thus they would stand to gain from it). The Guarantee was important as a “fall-back” position if the liquidity event did not occur.

</div> Thus, even if LSI relied on the Guarantee to protect their investment and the Guarantee was an important factor in LSI’s decision to execute the SPA, this did not therefore mean that they could not have or did not rely on Goh’s representations or were not induced by them to enter the SPA. The two are not mutually exclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 There were other factors that appeared to weigh against reliance. For one, if a trade sale was “imminent” it would have become apparent to LSI that it had not materialised even when LSI was transferring the second tranche of payment to Goh for the shares on 22 January 2015. For another, even though an IPO had not occurred by June 2015 (after the trade sale did not materialise) LSI still had not registered any protest against Goh’s representations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 However, the representations were not static but continually repeated. Right before the SPA was signed on 25 November 2014, LSI’s representatives were told that a trade sale was going to happen “very soon”. Goh then continued to assert those representations <span class="font-italic">after</span> the SPA had been executed. Even while Florence was asked to transfer the second tranche of payment over, Goh sent a WhatsApp on 13 January 2015 to Florence and Andy stating, “Trade Sale is on… [trade sale deal] is <span class="font-italic">immediate</span> …”

</div> When the trade sale eventually did not materialise, it was not unusual that Florence and Andy did not voice their concerns then. After all, the Trade Sale Representations were made <span class="font-italic">together</span> with the IPO Representations, in that if a trade sale did not occur, an IPO was nevertheless targeted for June 2015. Indeed, on 13 March 2015, Florence did email Goh to enquire “how the IPO is going in Singapore”.

First, while the relationship between the parties was mainly commercial, there was an element of trust involved. Florence repeatedly referred to Goh as her “shifu”, a term of respect connoting a “master”, while Goh called Andy and Florence his “disciples”.

There was also a “genuine possibility” that the Chinese investors had further dealt with their beneficial interest such that they were no longer able to return their shares to Goh. Mr Singh SC submitted that these arguments were not pleaded by Goh nor mentioned in his AEIC and not put to Andy and Florence, and hence should be disregarded.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The principle that undergirds the power to rescind a contract on the ground of misrepresentation is <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. As Lord Wright explained in <span class="font-italic">Spence v Crawford</span> [1939] 3 All ER 271 at 288:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Restoration … is essential to the idea of restitution. To take the simplest case, if a plaintiff who has been defrauded seeks to have the contract annulled and his money or property restored to him, it would be inequitable if he did not also restore what he had got under the contract from the defendant. Though the defendant has been fraudulent, he must not be robbed, nor must the plaintiff be unjustly enriched, as he would be if he both got back what he had parted with and kept what he had received in return. The purpose of the relief is not punishment, but compensation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 However, where third party rights have intervened and title passes from the representor (or representee) to an innocent third party purchaser for value, this may bar rescission (<span class="font-italic">see</span> Birke Hacker, “Rescission and Third Party Rights” 14 RLR 21 (2006) (“Birke Hacker”) at pp 30–31). As misrepresentation does not make a contract void ab initio but only voidable, the contract is, until the moment of rescission, effective to create rights and obligations, and to transfer property (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>, at para 11.100). Hence, if restitution cannot be achieved, the representee is unable to rescind the contract but will have to resort to damages if available. The requirement for restoration does not mean that it must be possible to place the parties in exactly the same position they were respectively in all respects. The court has the flexibility, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to make such orders as are necessary and appropriate to adjust for any change to property in the interim between the making of the contract and its rescission, and as long as substantial restitution is possible, the remedy will not be withheld. (See <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> at para 11.136).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Returning to LSI’s submissions (at [98]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>above), I disagree with LSI. First, it is LSI who is claiming a declaration that the SPA is validly avoided or alternatively for an order for rescission, and for the return of the entire purchase price. LSI cannot be taken by surprise at its own claim for relief, and the onus is on it to satisfy the court that rescission is possible. As such, LSI should have presented its evidence at trial on this issue. This is all the more so in the present case when it is LSI (the representee) who had transferred the beneficial interest in the property (shares) to a third party (the Chinese investors) and thus it would be in the position to show whether it could avail itself of the remedy sought. Second, that Goh’s reliance on the Investment Agreements was not pleaded in his Defence was because they were only produced by LSI in discovery, although they were within LSI’s knowledge and possession all along.

Nevertheless, I am of the view that the third party rights of the Chinese investors precluded rescission as a remedy. Rescission operates as a general rule to set aside the contract in its entirety and a representee cannot choose to rescind parts of a contract (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 11.109).

Hence, for the 1,500 shares that LSI beneficially owns, I award LSI the difference in the purchase price (of $450 per share) and the current value which is to be taken as the date of the assessment of damages.

</div> including LSI’s own share, from RMB into SGD. Accordingly, I award LSI any forex losses suffered for 4.68% of the shares (which it beneficially owned) – which should be computed based on the difference between the prevailing exchange rate at the time LSI had converted RMB into SGD to pay for 4.68% of the shares and the date of judgment. Given that there are two dates on which LSI had converted moneys from RMB to SGD, I order that the earlier date of 17 December 2014 be used, on the assumption that LSI would have used its own money to pay off the first tranche of the purchase price for some the shares. There is evidence from the Investment Agreements (one of which was executed on 11 January 2015) that LSI was at that date still sourcing for more Chinese investors. LSI in closing submissions have not asked for pre-judgment interest, and I will make no award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Exemplary damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 LSI further sought exemplary damages of the 15% IRR for two years (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as per the Guarantee), which would amount to $4,651,112. It claimed that punitive damages were appropriate as Goh had made a profit of approximately $3m and he had procured the use of AMP, in breach of his fiduciary duties, to indemnify LSI solely for his personal benefit.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and others</span> [2017] 1 SLR 918 at [176], the Court of Appeal held that “punitive damages may be awarded in tort where the totality of the defendant’s conduct is so outrageous that it warrants punishment, deterrence, and condemnation.” Whilst Goh may have, as I had found, made the representations fraudulently, this did not necessarily lead to an award of punitive damages. To hold otherwise would mean that every case in which fraudulent misrepresentation is made out would justify an award of punitive damages. I do not consider this a proper case for a punitive award as I did not find Goh’s conduct so outrageous that it warranted punishment, deterrence or condemnation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 That Goh may have procured AMP to indemnify LSI, would be a breach of Goh’s fiduciary duties (if any) in respect of AMP and not LSI. It should also be noted that Goh had executed the SPA in his personal capacity, which LSI was aware of. Next, it is not the case that Goh was obliged to sell to LSI shares which he procured only from the Minority Shareholders and at “cost” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the price that Goh was buying from the Minority Shareholders). The SPA was a commercial transaction which Florence and Andy had entered into (via LSI) because they hoped to profit from a liquidity event and they were prepared to pay $450 per share. That Goh may have profited from selling the AMP shares to LSI is thus irrelevant. Moreover, notwithstanding the misrepresentations, LSI could have called on the Guarantee to sell the shares back to Goh at the end of 24 months from the date of the SPA at the purchase price plus IRR, as there had been no trade sale or IPO. Instead, LSI elected to avoid and rescind the contract before the 24-month period. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Tracing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Mr Singh SC submitted that the “equitable remedy of tracing” would be pursued by a separate action if the court finds fraudulent misrepresentation. Based on its closing submissions, LSI is not asking this court to make a determination on tracing.

</div> I thus make a brief observation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Tracing is not a claim or remedy but essentially a process to identify an asset as a substitute for the original asset that belongs to a claimant (see <span class="font-italic">Foskett v McKeown</span> [2000] 2 WLR 1299 at 1323G). However, tracing would seem to be available only upon rescission of a contract. As was observed in <span class="font-italic">Shalson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Russo</span> [2005] Ch 281 at [122], “upon rescission of a contract for fraudulent misrepresentation, the beneficial title which passed to the representor under the contract revests in the representee. The representee then enjoys a sufficient proprietary title to enable him to trace, follow and recover what, by virtue of such revesting, can be regarded as having always been in equity his own property”. As I had found that rescission was barred and I had ordered damages instead, tracing would not have been available to LSI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Goh’s counterclaim for wrongful rescission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Goh counterclaimed for nominal damages of $3,000 for wrongful repudiation of the SPA. Since I have found him liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, it did not lie in his mouth to claim there was a wrongful repudiation of the SPA. Although LSI could not obtain the remedy of rescission due to a bar, it was entitled to damages. I thus dismiss Goh’s counterclaim. In any event, even if I am wrong and that LSI had wrongfully terminated the SPA, Goh has not proved that he has suffered any damage (let alone the quantum of it) from the purported wrongful repudiation. He would then have obtained the full benefit of the purchase price transferred to him pursuant to the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In conclusion, I allow LSI’s claim, with damages in part, and dismiss Goh’s counterclaim.
