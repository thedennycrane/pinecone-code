<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Mdm Wong Kim Wan @ Loretta
                    Wong (“Mdm Wong”) and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant, Mr Leong Ong Meng Jerome Matthew (“Mr Leong”)
                    and his mother, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Mdm Koh Kim
                    Neo, are the owners of a commercial property, No 20 Maxwell Road, #09-18,
                    Maxwell House, Singapore 069113 (the “property”). Mdm Wong
                    sought an order that the property be delivered to her within 2 weeks, that the
                    property be sold at not less than 80% of $270,000 within 3 months and that she
                    has sole conduct of the sale of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 23 October 1997, Mdm Wong and the
                    defendants purchased the property for $308,000. Mdm Wong has a half share
                    of the property while each of the defendants has a quarter share of the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties purchased the property for
                    investment purposes. There is no outstanding mortgage on the
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After the property was purchased, it was managed
                    by Mr Leong. The property was initially leased to Wayne Wood Pte Ltd from
                    23 October 1997 to 31 March 2000. The monthly rental was $750.
                    Mdm Wong alleged that the property was simultaneously occupied by a
                    business owned by Mr Leong as well as another company, Allied Consultants,
                    which is owned by Mr Leong’s relatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mdm Wong asserted that in 2001, the
                    defendants changed the locks to the property without her consent and did not
                    allow her to enter the property. The defendants replied that the changing of the
                    locks had been necessitated by the installation of carpets, cupboards and wall
                    partitions. However, this did not excuse the failure to provide Mdm Wong
                    with a set of the new keys for the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Faced with the impasse, she claimed that in
                    2008, she offered to buy over the defendants’ share of the property for
                    $150,000. She complained that she had wanted to take a bank loan to purchase the
                    shares but the defendants refused to allow a valuer to enter the property to
                    carry out a valuation of the property for the purpose of obtaining a bank
                    loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mdm Wong asserted that the property is
                    presently not being properly exploited for the benefit of all the co-owners and
                    that at the present moment, the property is being used by Mr Leong with no
                    rent paid to her. She claims to have paid the maintenance fees for the property
                    without receiving any reimbursement from the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendants retorted that Mdm Wong had
                    been a difficult person to deal with and that they had always been willing and
                    able to sell the property. They claimed that the property had been empty since
                    2002 and that they had received no rental since that year. Mr Leong added
                    that Allied Consultants was never located at the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendants contended that they had all along
                    been willing to sell their share of the property to Mdm Wong for $150,000
                    and that they had gone so far as to prepare an option for the proposed sale of
                    their share to her but she did not take steps to finalise the transaction. They
                    added that there was no need for a valuation of the property before
                    Mdm Wong signed the option as she had always wanted to purchase their share
                    of the property for $150,000. However, the defendants missed the point as
                    Mdm Wong had contended that the valuation of the property was required for
                    the purpose of her bank loan to pay for the defendants’ share of the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendants also slammed Mdm Wong for
                    being uncooperative in the sale of the property to other persons. They claimed
                    that in March 2010, an interested buyer offered $293,822 for the property but
                    Mdm Wong refused to sign the option. The defendants also said that they
                    currently have an offer to purchase the property for $300,000. On
                    3 September 2010, their solicitors, Chin Patrick &amp; Co, wrote to
                    Mdm Wong’s solicitors, Goh Phai Cheng LLC to inform them of the offer
                    and that a valuation report dated 17 August 2010 by GSK Global had placed
                    the value of the property at $300,000. The defendants pointed out that
                    Mdm Wong did not respond to this offer and remained uncooperative while
                    complaining that she had not been given an opportunity to market the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In reply, Mdm Wong questioned why the
                    defendants were so insistent that the property be sold to a particular buyer and
                    that this made her suspicious. She contended that even after she instituted the
                    present proceedings, the defendants have refused to allow her to have unimpeded
                    access to the property for the purpose of selling it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the outset, it must be noted that the
                    property has not been economically exploited for the benefit of all the owners
                    of the property for many years due to the bitter and unnecessary fight between
                    its owners. Evidently, both parties had, in varying degrees, been unnecessarily
                    difficult but it is not necessary for me to rule on which party has been more
                    uncooperative as what is required in a case such as this to end all the
                    infighting is to have the property sold and the sale proceeds divided between
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Section 18(2) of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) read with
                    para 2 of Schedule 1, empowers the High Court in any cause or matter
                    relating to land to partition land and direct a sale in lieu of partition
                    “where it appears necessary or expedient, to order the land or any part
                    of it to be sold, and to give all necessary and consequential
                    directions”. In <em>Abdul Razak Valibhoy and another v
                        Abdul Rahim Valibhoy and others</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 441,
                    the Court of Appeal noted at [16] that “the court in exercising its
                    discretion to order a sale would take into account all the relevant
                    circumstances and, in particular, would not order a sale, when to do so would
                    assist one party to commit a breach of contract”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Chiam Heng Luan v Chiam
                        Heng Hsien and others</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 305, Judith
                    Prakash J, who exercised the power under the Act to order the sale of a
                    property, noted at [97] that the property in that case was a valuable asset that
                    had not being properly exploited for the economic benefit of all the owners. In
                    the present case, as the relationship between the parties had deteriorated, they
                    cannot be expected to co-operate with each other for the proper economic
                    exploitation of the property for their mutual benefit. What is clear is that
                    there will be no hardship or injustice to any of the owners of the property if
                    the property is sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Both counsel confirmed that their respective
                    clients wanted to sell the property but both made demands which the other party
                    could not accept. Mdm Wong refused to sell the property to the
                    defendants’ buyer for $300,000 as she wanted to see if there could be
                    better offers. On the other hand, the defendants submitted that it made no sense
                    to grant Mdm Wong her request for an exclusive right to market the property
                    at a price that is not less than 80% of $270,000 when they already had an offer
                    of $300,000 for the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In view of the acrimony between the parties
                    and the positions adopted by the parties in the past, the parties will continue
                    to face a stalemate if they did not get their act together by having one party
                    buy the other party’s share at an agreed price or by having the property
                    sold to a buyer approved by both parties. I had no doubt that to nudge the
                    parties along, it was necessary and expedient that an order be made for the
                    property to be sold in the open market and that neither party should have sole
                    conduct of the sale. I thus ordered that Mdm Wong be given a set of the
                    keys to the property by the defendants within 3 days and that the property be
                    sold within 3 months. The parties then agreed that they will each appoint an
                    estate agent, both of whom will jointly market the property at a price not less
                    than $300,000. Hopefully, these arrangements will end the problems faced by the
                    parties for far too long.</p>
