The applicants (who are creditors of the Company) made this application for an order pursuant to s 204(3) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IRDA”) that they be given an advantage over other creditors with respect to the distribution of assets/expenses recovered or assets protected or preserved as a result of funding provided by them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I granted the application for the reasons set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Company was wound up in 2020 and a liquidator was appointed by the court (the “Liquidator”). The applicants were creditors of the Company and they filed their proofs of debt accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Liquidator took steps to investigate the Company’s affairs but the Company and/or the liquidation estate ran out of funds for the Liquidator to continue his work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At a creditors’ meeting, the Liquidator informed the Company’s creditors that he was unable to continue investigations into the Company’s affairs and pursue recovery of the Company’s assets due to a lack of funds. At the same meeting, a Committee of Inspection was formed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6  The Liquidator and the applicants subsequently entered into a funding agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) for the purposes of pursuing recovery of the Company’s assets. The essential terms of the Funding Agreement were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicants would provide funding for the Liquidator’s investigations into the Company’s accounts and prior transactions (“Phase 1”). Phase 1 would not involve any recovery of the Company’s assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Upon completion of Phase 1, the Liquidator would inform the applicants if he wishes to proceed with any claim for which funding would be required. The applicants had the right but not the obligation to fund any of the claims. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Liquidator would have full control of any legal proceedings brought by the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Any moneys recovered from proceedings funded by the applicants (the “Recovered Assets”) would be applied, on a quarterly basis, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The Recovered Assets would first be used to pay the applicants the amounts funded by them.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Thereafter, 75% of the Recovered Assets would go towards payment of the amounts adjudicated by the Liquidator to be owing to the applicants under their respective proofs of debt. The remaining 25% would go towards payment of the amounts adjudicated to be owing to the other creditors under their respective proofs of debt.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The Liquidator retained the discretion to pay the applicants less than 75% of the Recovered Assets in any quarter (but no less than 70%) where he reasonably believed that more funds were required for the purpose of the liquidation of the Company. When such concerns had been addressed and the Company had sufficient funds, the Liquidator would pay the applicants the amount withheld in addition to 75% of the Recovered Assets that would be payable in the next applicable quarter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Company’s other creditors were given the opportunity to provide the Liquidator with funding but declined to do so. They also did not object to the Funding Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The application was made pursuant to s 204(3) of the IRDA. Section 204 of the IRDA states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Funding by creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">204.—(1)  Where in any winding up —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  assets have been recovered under an indemnity for costs of litigation given by certain creditors;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  assets have been protected or preserved by the payment of moneys or the giving of an indemnity by certain creditors; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  expenses in relation to which a creditor has indemnified a liquidator have been recovered,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the Court may make such order as it thinks just with respect to the distribution of those assets and the amount of those expenses so recovered, with a view to giving those creditors an advantage over others in consideration of the risks run by those creditors in giving those indemnities or paying those moneys.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any creditor may apply to the Court for an order under subsection (3) prior to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  giving an indemnity for costs of litigation for recovering any assets;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  paying any moneys or giving an indemnity to protect or preserve any assets; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  indemnifying a liquidator in relation to the liquidator’s expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  On an application by a creditor under subsection (2), the Court may, for the purpose of giving the creditor an advantage over others in consideration of the risks to be run by that creditor in giving the indemnity or payment for the purposes mentioned in that subsection, grant an order with respect to the distribution of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  the assets mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that may be successfully recovered;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  the assets mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that may be successfully protected or preserved; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  the amount of expenses mentioned in subsection (2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) that may be successfully recovered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Section 204(1) of the IRDA is similar to s 328(10) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which has since been repealed by the IRDA. However, ss 204(2) and 204(3) of the IRDA are new. As the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo v Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation </span>[2022] SGHC 312 (“<span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span>”) at [12]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As can be observed, the main difference between s 204 of the IRDA and s 328(1) of the Companies Act is that the latter only provided for <span class="font-italic">retrospective</span> orders, in the sense that the court may make a relevant order only <span class="font-italic">after </span>the relevant assets had been recovered, protected, or preserved, or after the relevant expenses had been recovered. In contrast, s 204(2) of the IRDA now allows the court to make, in addition to retrospective orders, <span class="font-italic">prospective </span>orders prior to the giving of an indemnity by a creditor. This means that a court can make a relevant order <span class="font-italic">before </span>the relevant assets have been recovered, protected, or preserved, or before the relevant expenses have been recovered. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factors to be considered under s 204(3) of the IRDA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span>, the court set out the following general non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in the grant of a prospective order under s 204(3) of the IRDA (at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the complexity and necessity of the proceedings in respect of which the funding or indemnity is given;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the extent of the funding or indemnity to be provided, and the level of risk to be undertaken and the costs to be borne by the funding creditor;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the failure of other creditors to provide funding or indemnity and whether the other creditors were given the opportunity to do so;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the emergence of other creditors between the making of the order and the date of a distribution under the order to the funding creditor;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide funding or indemnity to enable assets to be recovered; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the presence or absence of any objections from the other creditors, the liquidator, or the Official Assignee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 With respect to factor (a), it is not clear that much can be said about the necessity of the intended proceedings. After all, the reason why the funding or indemnity is required in the first place is that the proceedings are necessary to recover moneys or assets due to the Company. As for the complexity of the proceedings, its relevance is that it is a good indication of the level of risk assumed by the funding creditor (which is dealt with under factor (b)). In general, the more complex the proceedings, the higher the risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Factor (b), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the extent of the funding or indemnity and the level of risk, is relevant to the question of the degree or extent of the advantage that the court should give to the funding creditor. This is clear from s 204(3) of the IRDA which refers to “giving the creditor an advantage over others <span class="font-italic">in consideration of the risks</span> to be run by that creditor” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The court in <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span> did not elaborate on factor (d) above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the emergence of other creditors after the making of the order. It is not clear how this factor should be applied since it refers to matters arising <span class="font-italic">after </span>the order has been made. In my view, this should not be a factor to be considered when the court is making a prospective order under s 204(3) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As for factor (e), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide funding or indemnity, it seems to me that this merely explains the rationale behind s 204(3) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span>, the court also decided (at [61]) that notwithstanding the order granted under s 204(3) of the IRDA, other creditors who may be prejudiced by the order should be given an opportunity to bring an appropriate challenge. However, in the present case, I agreed with the applicants that an order under s 204(3) of the IRDA should not be subject to such a term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Section 204(2) of the IRDA was enacted to permit prospective orders because it was recognised that otherwise, at the point of providing the funds, the funding creditors would have no assurance that the court would make an order giving them an advantage over other creditors (see <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee: Final Report </span>(Chair: Lee Eng Beng SC) (2013) at p 74; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(1 October 2018) vol 94 (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)). Creditors would be less willing to provide the necessary funding or indemnity without any such assurance and, as the court recognised in <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span> (at [16]), it is in the public interest to encourage creditors to provide funding or indemnity to enable assets to be recovered. Making an order under s 204(3) of the IRDA subject to the possibility of subsequent challenges by other creditors would be inconsistent with the purpose of the prospective order and unfair to the funding creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17  Another factor to be considered is whether the proposed funding or indemnity requires the liquidator to cede control over the intended proceedings to the funding creditor: see, also, <span class="font-italic">Song Jianbo</span> at [60(a)]. The liquidator should retain control over the intended proceedings. Such control addresses the public policy concerns about the administration of justice: see <span class="font-italic">Lavrentiadis, Lavrentios v Dextra </span><span class="font-italic">Partners Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another matter </span>[2023] SGHC 131 (“<span class="font-italic">Lavrentiadis</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30]. It is not necessary for the liquidator to have complete control of every single aspect of the legal proceedings; it would be reasonable for the funding creditor’s consent to be required with respect to the choice of solicitors, or any settlement or discontinuance of the proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Lavrentiadis</span> at [30]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In summary, in my view, the non-exhaustive factors to be considered in the grant of a prospective order under s 204(3) of the IRDA are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the advantage to be given to the funding creditor is reasonable, taking into account the funding or indemnity to be provided and the level of risk to be undertaken. The complexity of the intended proceedings is a relevant factor in assessing the level of risk to be undertaken.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the other creditors were given the opportunity to provide the funding or indemnity. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether there are any objections from the other creditors, the liquidator or the Official Assignee. It is unlikely though that there would be objections from the liquidator since any proposed funding or indemnity would have been negotiated and agreed upon with the liquidator first.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the liquidator retains control over the intended proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on the application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I granted the application and made an order under s 204(3) of the IRDA giving the applicants an advantage over other creditors on the terms set out in the Funding Agreement for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The advantage to be given to the applicants (see [6] above) was reasonable given the risk that the applicants would be undertaking. Clearly, there was no certainty of recovery.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The other creditors were given the opportunity to provide funding or indemnity but had declined to do so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There were no objections from the other creditors, the Liquidator or the Official Assignee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Liquidator would retain full control of any legal proceedings brought by the Company.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Baldev Singh Bhinder and Vaybhav Kumar Sharma s/o Thakor Prasad Sharma (BlackStone &amp; Gold LLC) for the first applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jamal Siddique Peer and Suresh Viswanath (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the second applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Muhammad Imran Bin Abdul Rahim and Kuek Zihui (Eldan Law LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
