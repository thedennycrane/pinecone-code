        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a painting contractor in the
                    business of mixed construction and renovation services, including paint
                    application works. The defendant is a manufacturer and supplier of paints. The
                    defendant has been supplying the plaintiff with paint for three separate
                    projects since 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first proposal given to the plaintiff by the
                    defendant only included paint manufactured by the defendant for use on the
                    external surfaces. However, in relation to a project at Toh Guan that the
                    plaintiff was working on, the defendant submitted a proposal in January 2006,
                    which included the use of its paint for internal surfaces:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1"><b>2.   </b>
<b><u>Internal
                            Concrete Surfaces Including Ceiling</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Primer Coat    : 1 coat of Berger Decora
                        Emulsion</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finishing Coat    : 1 coat of Berger Decora
                            Emulsion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The product data sheet provided to the plaintiff
                    stated that as surface preparation, one had to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, “apply a suitable sealer coat such as Berger
                    Plastaseal or Berger Water-Based Sealer” prior to application of the
                    Berger Decora Emulsion. This was not reflected in the proposal submitted by the
                    defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had then inquired whether a sealer
                    coat was necessary, as a result of which, the defendant wrote a letter dated
                    12 January 2006, that read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>Subject:   </b>

                            Paint System For Toh Guan Road East Capital

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With reference to the above subject and our discussion regarding the
                        coating for the internal concrete surfaces including ceiling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are pleased to forward our letter for your submission to your client
                        that it is not a [sic] necessary to apply a sealer coat before applying
                        Berger Decora Emulsion even though it was stated in our product
                        datasheet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In addition to the above letter, there was a
                    further communication by the defendant on 13 January 2006, granting the
                    plaintiff a warranty on the proposed paint:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>Subject:   </b>
<b>Warranty</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With reference to the above subject, we will be providing you with five
                        (5) years warranty on our products used in any of your up coming project as
                        long as is base on our proposed paint system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The effect of this warranty, in particular, has been hotly disputed.
                    The plaintiff claims it is an open warranty that applies to all future projects
                    undertaken by itself, but the defendant maintains that the warranty only applied
                    to the project at Toh Guan. I will return to this point later. However, for now,
                    it suffices to say that the plaintiff relied on these communications in relation
                    to the project at Toh Guan and ordered Berger Decora Emulsion. The paint was
                    applied to the internal surfaces of the project at Toh Guan without a sealer
                    coat. There were no problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In July 2007, the defendant approached the
                    plaintiff with a proposal to use its paints in a project located at Bukit Batok
                    Street 23 (“the Project”). This proposal also suggested,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the use of Berger Decora Emulsion
                    on internal surfaces:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1"><b>2.   </b>

                        Emulsion</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finishing Coat    : 1 coat of Berger Decora
                            Emulsion</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant’s proposal was included without alteration in
                    the plaintiff’s quotation for the Project. There was in this instance, no
                    request or provision of confirmation that no sealer coat was necessary for the
                    Project, notwithstanding the data sheet to the contrary, unlike the case in the
                    previous Toh Guan project. Berger Decora Emulsion is a low cost paint that was
                    supplied to the plaintiff at a cost of S$1.125 per litre. Based on the
                    defendant’s proposal, the plaintiff tendered a quotation of S$1,900,000.00
                    for the painting works at the Project to the main contractor. This was accepted
                    and the plaintiff was appointed to carry out painting works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Painting works at the Project were carried out
                    between September 2007 and April 2008. Between August 2007 and April 2008, the
                    defendant supplied the plaintiff with, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    Berger Decora Emulsion from 31 different batches of manufacture
                    (“the Paint”) for a total sum of S$49,250.00. As and when the
                    plaintiff required paint, it would place an order with the defendant. The paint
                    would be delivered together with a delivery order on which the plaintiff had to
                    sign against receipt. After that, the defendant would issue a tax invoice
                    against which the plaintiff would make payment. Significantly, in each tax
                    invoice, it was provided:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 18 April 2008, however, the plaintiff
                    complained to the defendant that various internal surfaces in the Project had
                    discoloured subsequent to the application of the Paint. The surfaces had turned
                    pinkish and there were patterns of discolouration (collectively “the
                    discolouration”). It alleged that the Paint was defective and was the
                    cause of the discolouration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Various meetings and on-site inspections were
                    held thereafter to investigate the plaintiff’s complaint and to ascertain
                    the cause of the discolouration. Subsequently, the defendant made a goodwill
                    offer to the plaintiff to provide replacement paint of a superior grade. The
                    labour cost of repainting would have to be borne by the plaintiff. The plaintiff
                    rejected the offer and insisted that the defendant bear the full costs of
                    rectifying the problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 15 May 2008, the plaintiff sent the
                    defendant a letter stating that the total cost of repainting, excluding the cost
                    of paint used, was S$443,243.20. The plaintiff demanded that the defendant bear
                    the cost in full. The defendant disputed its liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Absent any resolution of the problem between
                    the parties, the plaintiff carried out repainting works between June 2008 and
                    September 2009 using paint bought from another manufacturer. The plaintiff
                    purchased paint from Haruna (S) Pte Ltd at a total cost of S$52,242.75 for
                    repainting the Project (“the Haruna paint”). Subsequently, it
                    brought the present action against the defendant, claiming the costs of
                    rectifying the problem. It quantified these costs at S$1,185,545.60 in its
                    Statement of Claim (Amendment No.1). Despite the voluminous evidence adduced at
                    trial, the plaintiff’s case is essentially a simple one that can be
                    summarised in the following fashion: I bought paint from you, which was either
                    defective or unsuitable for my purposes. It discoloured after application. I had
                    to repaint the Project because of the problem. Therefore, you owe me the cost of
                    the supplies and labour I expended during repainting. The crucial question in
                    this case accordingly is whether the Paint was defective or unsuitable to the
                    Project. The defendant is also pursuing a counterclaim for sums arising from
                    unpaid invoices for paint supplied to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The issues I had to consider were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Paint was defective or
                        unsuitable to the Project;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the defendant had contractually excluded
                        liability in the event of such defect or unsuitability;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the appropriate
                        quantum of damages, if any.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Paint was defective or unsuitable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It was undisputed that the Paint had
                    discoloured after application to the surfaces of the Project. I also find that
                    the discolouration was widespread and extended to most, if not all of the
                    surfaces painted. As an aside, I would add that while the defendant tried to put
                    forth the case that the discolouration was localised and not as rampant as the
                    plaintiff claimed, I did not think that was tenable. The photographs alone,
                    particularly the exhibit at page 43 of Mr Lee Kok Soon George’s
                    affidavit of 23 June 2010, showed that the discolouration was very
                    widespread. Moreover, witnesses for the plaintiff, such as Mr Sundararajan
                    and Ms Elizabeth Lee, have testified that on a visual inspection, the
                    discolouration was widespread. Taken together with the photographs, I found
                    their account on this point to be more credible than that of the
                    defendant’s witnesses to the contrary. The photographic evidence did not
                    support the finding that the discoloration was localised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s case turns on its
                    establishing that it was the Paint that caused the discolouration. If the
                    discolouration was caused by the Paint then the defendant would be <em>prima facie</em> liable subject to the enforceability of
                    their exclusion clauses in the delivery order and tax invoices. The
                    discolouration could have been caused by any one or a combination of the Paint,
                    the preparation or application of the Paint, the surface preparation or
                    condition of the skim coat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Ms Elizabeth Lee, the expert witness for
                    the plaintiff, put up a report based on her site inspection, 5 pails of
                    Paint provided by the plaintiff, and 5 random dry Paint samples taken from
                    the Project. She performed Thermal Gravimetric Analysis on the samples, to
                    measure weight changes in materials with regard to temperature. She also
                    performed cross-section SEM/EDX (Scanning Electron Microscopy) Analysis that
                    gave information about the number of coats applied, the thickness of the
                    individual coats, the bonding between coating to substrate and between
                    individual coats, and pigment distribution. Based on the results of the
                    analyses, she concluded that there had been disintegration of the Paint
                    ingredients. Mr Wong Chung Wun, the expert witness for the defendant (who
                    had not conducted site inspections or tests of his own but merely reviewed
                    Ms Elizabeth Lee’s report), agreed that the Paint had disintegrated.
                    However, he did not accept Ms Elizabeth’s conclusion that
                    “Poor paint condition in container resulted in coating discoloration at
                    the [Project]”. The element of causation was a major point of contention
                    in the defendant’s closing submissions. In particular, it was submitted
                    that the plaintiff had failed to rule out excessive moisture and the alkalinity
                    of the skim coat underlying the Paint, as possible causes of the
                    discoloration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I accepted that at the time of painting, the
                    internal surfaces of the Project probably did not have excessive moisture
                    levels. Mr Sundararajan s/o Nadarajan, the supervisor of the main
                    contractors who hired the plaintiff for the project testified that before the
                    start of painting works, he would test random spots to be painted using a
                    moisture gauge to check that the concrete is not wet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was done as a standard
                    procedure before paint application. I saw no reason to disbelieve him.
                    Mr Rajeev Goel, the Regional Technology Manager of the defendant testified
                    that the walls were unduly moist on the basis of a touch test (<em>ie</em>, he had pressed his hand against the wall) conducted
                    several months after the discolouration had happened. Between the two witnesses,
                    I preferred Mr Sundararajan’s evidence. He had performed the test
                    contemporaneously with the painting and his methods appeared to have been the
                    standard methods unlike Mr Goel’s touch test. I accepted his account
                    that the walls would not have had overly high moisture levels at the time of the
                    painting works. This finding is also supported by the results of the SEM/EDX
                    test carried out by Ms Elizabeth Lim that indicated good bonding between
                    the different coats of Paint. As she explained, if there had been moisture,
                    salts would have formed between the layers and cause poor adhesion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was the point on the alkalinity of the skim
                    coat that I found much harder to rule out. Before the Paint was applied, a skim
                    coat was added by another subcontractor to the internal surfaces of the Project
                    for smoothening purposes. No sealer coat was applied between the skim coat and
                    the Paint. The composition of the skim coat was alkaline in nature. It is the
                    defendant’s case that the interaction of the alkaline skim coat with the
                    Paint could have caused the discoloration. It is the defendant’s case that
                    the plaintiff had not shown that the discoloration could not have been caused by
                    anything other than defects in the Paint. For completeness, it should be noted
                    that the surfaces covered with the Paint were sanded before they were repainted
                    with the Haruna paint, although the underlying Paint was not entirely sanded
                        off.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> No evidence was led to establish the condition
                    of the skim coat at the time when the Haruna paint was applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Ms Elizabeth Lee testified for the
                    plaintiff that the results of the tests she ran showed that the Paint could be
                    applied directly to a highly alkaline skim coat without a sealer coat without
                    resulting in discoloration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The test involved applying
                    coats of the sample paint to concrete slabs finished with skim coat, and
                    observing for discoloration and compositional variation. I had reservations
                    because the tests she carried out to reach this conclusion did not use the same
                    skim coat as the one applied in the Project. I could not thereby conclude that
                    the skim coat used in the Project was of a similar or lesser alkalinity than the
                    one she used. Moreover, the paint sample she applied came from five pails chosen
                    by the plaintiff out of the dozens supplied by the defendant. Without casting
                    any aspersions on how these were selected, I could not be sure whether the five
                    pails were accurately representative samples of the entire supply of Paint used
                    in the Project. Moreover, there had been a long time lag between the receipt of
                    the Paint from the defendant and the handing over of the five pails to
                    Ms Elizabeth Lee for testing – I could not rule out the possibility
                    that storage conditions and other factors might have affected the composition or
                    quality of the samples in the five pails. The same reasoning applied to
                    Ms Elizabeth Lee’s conclusion that the “condition in container
                    of the fresh paint samples should constitute cause for rejection of the
                    material”. Had such paint been delivered and found to be in such
                    condition when the Paint was applied, it would have then been properly rejected
                    by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Ms Elizabeth Lee also testified that the
                    samples she selected, whether from a discoloured or non-discoloured patch, all
                    contained skim coat; the difference between the discoloured and non-discoloured
                    samples lay in resin content of the Paint. This, according to her, suggested
                    that it was the Paint and not the skim coat that caused the discoloration.
                    However, as pointed out by the defendant, the difference in resin content,
                    determined <em>after</em> the discoloration had occurred,
                    only went to show that there had been disintegration of the Paint. The
                    disintegration of the Paint after its application may be the result of either
                    improper mixing of the Paint before application or the result of the skim coat
                    itself in different areas on the Paint. In and of itself, it did not show that
                    defects in the Paint had caused the discoloration. Ms Elizabeth Lee did not
                    explain to my satisfaction how the disintegration of the Paint necessarily
                    evidenced defects in the Paint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Against this backdrop, I weighed the fact that
                    the Paint delivered had been taken from 31 different batches manufactured
                    by the defendant. If indeed all the Paint were defective, it would suggest a
                    manufacturing problem, <em>eg</em> with the formulation of
                    the Paint. Considering that this was an off-the-shelf product, however, and that
                    the plaintiff itself had used it previously without encountering problems, and
                    that no defects were noticed upon the mixing and painting when the Paint was
                    applied, I did not think this likely. I accepted Mr Gerard
                    Albuquerque’s evidence that samples of Paint taken from the Project were
                    tested and found compliant with the specifications indicated on the
                    defendant’s product data sheet. I also found it difficult to understand
                    why the plaintiff took 8 months to complain about the discoloration to the
                    defendant. The plaintiff attempted to justify this on the basis that as it
                    finished painting each level of the Project it would hand that over to the main
                    contractor and move on to the next, and as such had no opportunity to observe
                    the discoloration. However, surely the main contractors would have raised
                    concerns about the discoloration once they became manifest and would not have
                    waited till 8 months later. Further, the fact that the discoloration occurred in
                    patterns rather than random patches suggested interaction with an underlying
                    substances, rather than defects in the Paint alone. The fact was, the Paint was
                    not applied to bare concrete but to surfaces covered with skim coat – the
                    effect of the skim coat on the Paint has not been ruled out. This point,
                    significantly, was not discussed in Ms Elizabeth Lee’s report. When
                    questioned during cross-examination, she suggested that the pattern may have
                    been caused by the way the Paint was applied with roller brushes. However, from
                    my observation of the photos, for example those at page 16 and 17 of
                    Mr Lee Kok Soon George’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, I did not
                    think so. The paint would have had to be applied in a very strange manner indeed
                    to have caused such patterns. They were more consistent with the explanation
                    that the Paint had reacted with the skim coat. In view of all these, the
                    plaintiff has not proven on balance of probability that the defects in the Paint
                    had caused the discoloration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff submitted in the alternative
                    that even if the Paint was not defective, the defendant was liable for it had
                    submitted a proposal advising the use of paint that was unsuitable to the
                    Project. The problem with that submission is that the plaintiff had not
                    conformed to the product data sheet which specified that a sealer coat had to be
                    applied before using the type of Paint proposed. To make commercial sense, the
                    defendant’s proposal has to be read together with the data sheet. Unlike
                    the previous occasion involving the project at Toh Guan, the plaintiff had not
                    specifically clarified with the defendant that no sealer coat was necessary.
                    Even if I were to accept that the prior representation in the earlier project,
                    to the effect that no sealer coat was necessary, extended to this Project, there
                    was no evidence to show that the cause of the discolouration of the Paint was
                    the Paint without the sealer coat and not the surface condition and in
                    particular the skim coat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendant had contractually excluded liability for defect
                or unsuitability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the light of the above, there is no need to
                    go further to consider arguments under this head. I would just briefly note that
                    if I had to decide on the issue of the warranty, I would have found that the
                    defendant had warranted all its products used in any of the plaintiff’s
                    projects for a period of 5 years provided that the use was based on a
                    proposed paint system by the defendant. In respect of the arguments based on the
                    provisions in the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap. 396, 1994 Rev Ed)
                        (“<em>UCTA</em>”), I would not have found
                    the terms of the delivery orders and tax invoice to be unreasonable. The
                    defendant understandably sought to limit product liability given that between
                    the sale and application of the paint much could go wrong (either on the part of
                    the user or manufacturer) and it could be a tedious process (as demonstrated by
                    these proceedings) to determine fault. Moreover, the terms did not exclude
                    liability entirely – the defendant merely limited his expense to
                    replacement goods. Further, I have reservations as to whether the plaintiff was
                    a “consumer” who could avail himself of the <em>UCTA</em> provisions. It was engaged in a trade. The evidence showed
                    that it was likely a commercial party that had power to bargain and get
                    concessions from the plaintiff unlike the average consumer <em>UCTA</em> was meant to protect. In respect of the arguments based on
                    the Sale of Goods Act (Cap. 393, 1999 Rev Ed) (“<em>SOGA</em>”), I observe that the effect of s 55(2) is that
                    an express condition can negative the condition and warranties implied by the
                    statute if they are mutually inconsistent. I think it arguable that the terms as
                    found in the delivery order and the tax invoice are inconsistent with the
                    provisions in <em>SOGA</em> that would have otherwise been
                    helpful to the plaintiffs in establishing warranties as to the fitness,
                    character or quality of the Paint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Similarly, as the defendant’s liability
                    has not been established, it is not necessary for me to consider the
                    plaintiff’s quantification of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_23"></a>23     In the light of my findings above, I
                        dismiss the plaintiff’s action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1-p2_24"></a>24     The defendant’s counterclaim is
                        for the sum of S$72,676.62. Out of this sum, S$50,166.49 related to paint
                        products apart from the Paint that were supplied to the plaintiff. The
                        plaintiff did not dispute that it had contracted for these goods. It also
                        did not allege that these products were defective. The remaining sum of
                        $22,510.13 represented Paint supplied to the plaintiff that had not been
                        paid for. There was no dispute that the Paint had been ordered by the
                        plaintiff and delivered by the defendant against the delivery orders and tax
                        invoices. The plaintiff also did not deny that it has not paid against the
                        invoices the defendant counterclaims on. As such, I allow the
                        defendant’s counterclaim.</p>
