More specifically, the applicants are applying for the determination of the following question:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whether the Liquidators’ decisions to reject in their entirety all three of the claims, all dated 13 August 2021, each filed by (i) M/s Andreas Vogel &amp; Partner, Rechtsanwaelte, AV &amp; P Legal LLP …, [(ii)] M/s Andreas Vogel Pte Ltd … and (iii) Mr. Andreas Vogel … respectively … are valid and correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applicants have brought this application because the defendants did not apply under s 190 of the IRDA as an “aggrieved person” to challenge their decision. Because there is seemingly no prescribed deadline for the defendants to file such a challenge in a members’ voluntary winding up (as this case is concerned with), that would have left open the possibility of the defendants bringing such a challenge even after the dissolution of the Company. The applicants therefore bring the present application to preclude that possibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I first heard the parties on 1 November 2023, at which the parties had made detailed submissions on the merits of OA 220. Mr Andreas Vogel (“AV”), who appeared in person as the third defendant, and on behalf of the first and second defendants, said at the time that he wished to tender further translated documents for the applicants’ consideration. While the applicants were not obliged to do so, they agreed to receive and consider these documents. I therefore adjourned the hearing to give the defendants until 1 December 2023 to translate and provide these documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 However, even by the time the subsequent hearing took place on 29 January 2024, the defendants never provided the documents. At the hearing on 29 January 2024, AV explained that he could not translate the documents in time to meet the 1 December 2023 deadline and sought a further extension of time. In fact, AV said that he only managed to translate 15% of the documents concerned by 1 December 2023. I rejected AV’s request for more time because: (a) the applicants were not obliged to consider these documents in the first place as the defendants had not provided them previously before their claims were rejected; and (b) the defendants did not write into court or to the applicants to ask for an extension of time despite knowing that the deadline was 1 December 2023. Indeed, as Mr Lim Yee Ming (“Mr Lim”), who appeared for the applicants, suggested, AV could have tendered the 15% of the documents first but did not do so. As a result of my disallowing the defendants further time to submit the documents, the parties’ submissions, as well as the evidence before the court, remain the same now as at the last hearing on 1 November 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 While I therefore could have given my decision at the end of the hearing of 29 January 2024, AV requested for some time to negotiate with the applicants. In this regard, I note from Mr Lin Yueh Hing’s affidavit filed in support of this application that the applicants had made without prejudice offers to the defendants, but these were not accepted.

</div>
</div> Notwithstanding this, but considering that the matter has been going on for some time, I informed AV that unless I hear from the parties by 4pm on 2 February 2024 that they have reached a settlement, I will proceed to give my decision on OA 220. I only received an email from AV at 3.09pm on 2 February 2024 that the defendants have sent a proposal to the applicants for their consideration. But this is not, as I had said to the parties, an indication of any settlement or even that the parties are actively engaged in negotiations with a request for the court to withhold judgment. I therefore issue this judgment now at 5.30pm on 2 February 2024. There needs to be a resolution to the matter, especially since it is the defendants who have not complied with timelines asked of them by either the applicants or the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 After considering the parties’ submissions and the evidence, I allow OA 220 for the reasons below. In summary, my conclusions are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, some of the debts are time barred under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “LA”), because the services provided in the invoices occurred on or before 6 June 2015.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, some of the debts are pursuant to a Letter of Engagement dated 19 May 2010, which the Company is not bound by, pursuant to s 41 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CA”), because: (i) the contract was not entered into by the Company or by any other person on its behalf before incorporation; and (ii) the Company did not ratify the contract after its formation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, some of the debts lack contractual basis, because there is no evidence that the Company agreed to the rendering of services by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, although the defendants submit that they have a claim in <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>, regardless of whether contractual <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> or restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>is applied, the analysis of the above does not change.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The upshot of these findings is that I determine that the applicants’ decisions to reject all of the defendants’ claims were correctly made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I turn now to the background facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The first and second applicants, Mr Lin Yueh Hung and Mr Ng Kian Kiat, respectively, are the liquidators of the Company.

The Company was placed under members’ voluntary liquidation on 7 June 2021. On the same day, the applicants were appointed as the joint and several liquidators.

In the same letter, the applicants explained that they took the position that the invoices tendered, though issued between 2018 and 2021, were time-barred since much of the work done and services on the invoices were provided more than six years prior to the winding up of the Company. As of 13 March 2023, AVPLLP has not responded. The applicants also explained that AVPL did not provide evidence of any agreement with the Company for the provision of the claimed services. The applicants further informed AVPLLP and AVPL that if they failed to submit extra information, the applicants would proceed with the liquidation of the Company.

In this connection, on 2 August 2023, the High Court granted the first and second defendants’ applications in HC/SUM 1510/2023 (“SUM 1510”) and HC/SUM 1511/2023 (“SUM 1511”) for permission to be self-represented (see <span class="font-italic">Lin Yueh Hung </span><span class="font-italic">(as liquidators of CST South East Asia Pte Ltd (in members’ voluntary liquidation)) and another v Andreas Vogel &amp; Partner, Rechtsanwaelte, AV &amp; P Legal LLP and others</span> [2023] SGHC 208).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 As a preliminary point, the applicants submit that many of the documents filed in support of the defendants’ affidavits do not satisfy the requirements in O 3 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court 2021 (the “ROC 2021”). The court should therefore reject the use of those documents (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 417 (“<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span>”) at [55]).

First, there is no time bar preventing a creditor from appealing against the liquidator’s rejection of a proof of debt because r 132 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Corporate Insolvency and Restructuring) Rules 2020 (the “CIR Rules”) does not apply to a company under members’ voluntary liquidation. Therefore, generally, the defendants would only be prevented from claiming against the applicants after two years of the dissolution of the Company.

The first concerns whether the applicants can rely on s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA for the court to give the directions they have sought. In this regard, s 181 of the IRDA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application to Court to have questions determined or powers exercised</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">181.</span>—(1)  The liquidator or any creditor or contributory may apply to the Court —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The Court, if satisfied that the determination of the question … is just and beneficial, may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  accede wholly or partially to any such application on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  make such other order on the application as the Court thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In this regard, it is helpful to note that Black J had observed in the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> MF Global Australia Ltd (in liq) </span>[2012] NSWSC 994 in relation to s 511 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), being the Australian equivalent of s 181 of the IRDA, as follows (at [8]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 511 of the Corporations Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>provides an alternative source of power to give such a direction and the Liquidators also rely on that section. The principles applicable to an application under that section were recently reviewed by Ward J in <span class="font-italic">Re Purchas</span><span class="font-italic"> (as liquidator of Astarra Asset Management Pty Ltd (in liq)) </span>[2011] NSWSC 91 … Applications made under this section in a voluntary winding up are determined in a similar manner to applications in a Court ordered winding up under s 479(3) of the Corporations Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>notwithstanding that section does not expressly require that it be “just and beneficial” to give the relevant direction. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court may give such a direction where it will be “of advantage in the liquidation</span>”: <span class="font-italic">Dean-Willcocks v Soluble </span><span class="font-italic">Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd</span> (1997) 42 NSWLR 209 at 212; <span class="font-italic">Handberg</span><span class="font-italic"> (in his capacity as liquidator of S&amp;D International Pty Ltd) v MIG Property Services Pty Ltd </span>[2010] VSC 336;<span class="font-italic"> </span>(2010) 79 ACSR 373 at [7]. The effect of a determination under the section is to sanction a course of conduct on the part of the liquidator so that he or she may adopt that course free from the risk of personal liability for breach of duty: <span class="font-italic">S&amp;D International</span> at [7].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Accordingly, it would be appropriate for the applicants to bring the present application if they can show that it will be “of advantage in the liquidation”. In my judgment, the applicants have shown this, because this application will avert any uncertainty to the liquidation that can potentially arise from the defendants’ challenge of the rejection of their proofs of debt in the indetermined future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I turn then to whether the application under s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA is “of advantage in the liquidation”. This raises the question of whether the defendants can indeed challenge the rejection of their proofs of debt in the indetermined future. In this regard, s 218(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the IRDA states that where a company, other than an insolvent company, is being wound up, any debt or liability to which the company is subject at the commencement of the winding up is provable. Therefore, potential creditors of a company wound up through a members’ voluntary winding up are able to submit their proofs of debt to the liquidator to be proved. The liquidator is then empowered by s 218(4) of the IRDA to provide an estimate of the value of the debt or liability submitted under s 218(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the IRDA and the reasons as to why the debt does not bear a certain value. If the potential creditor is not satisfied with the liquidator’s estimate, he can appeal to the court by s 218(5) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 More specifically, rule 132(1) of the CIR Rules provides that a creditor who is dissatisfied with the decision of the liquidator of the company in rejecting a proof may appeal to the court to reverse or vary the decision of the liquidator. Rule 132(2) provides that this appeal must be made within 21 days after the rejection of the proof. However, r 132 must be read with r 130(1), which provides that rr 130–133 “applies to every winding up by the [c]ourt and every creditors’ voluntary winding up”. This does not include a <span class="font-italic">members’</span> voluntary winding up. Yet, the subsidiary legislation to the IRDA distinguishes between a creditors’ voluntary winding up and a members’ voluntary winding up. For instance, r 2(2) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Voluntary Winding Up) Regulations 2020 distinguishes between the two types of voluntary winding up. Therefore, given that Parliament does not legislate in vain (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [38]), the omission to state a members’ voluntary winding up in r 130(1) of the CIR Rules suggests that r 132 does not apply to a members’ voluntary winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, given the apparent lack of a time bar against the defendants’ right to appeal against the liquidators’ rejection of their proofs of debt, it is understandable and correct that the applicants seek a determination under s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. If the applicants prevail, they would be able to distribute $476,199.83 worth of cash deposits to the sole shareholder of the Company without concern of a potential “clawback” by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Indeed, as I mentioned at the outset, the defendants have not appealed against the applicants’ decision under s 190 of the IRDA. While the defendants now complain that this application appears “as if the [applicants] intend to direct the matter to the Court to approve their decision and seal it with the official authority of the Court to overcome their uncertainty of the appropriateness of their action”,

</div>
</div>
</div> the point remains that if the defendants do not challenge the applicants’ decision, the defendants will not be able to claim in any case. And if the defendants challenge the decision, the matter will end up in court for its determination anyway. As such, there is some irony in the defendants arguing against the applicants’ reliance on s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) now, when it is their inaction that prompted this application in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For these reasons, I conclude that the applicants can rely on s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA for the court to give the directions they have sought. This is because the applicants’ application under s 181(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA is “of advantage in the liquidation”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Lim can act for the applicants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I turn now to consider the defendants’ argument that Mr Lim cannot act for the applicants. To begin with, the court has a supervisory jurisdiction to regulate the conduct of its officers (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Harsha Rajkumar Mirpuri</span><span class="font-italic"> (Mrs) née Subita Shewakram Samtani v Shanti Shewakram Samtani Mrs Shanti Haresh Chugani</span> [2018] 5 SLR 894 (“<span class="font-italic">Harsha</span>”) at [73]). As such, the breaches of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “PCR”) are a possible “analytical tool” in deciding whether the court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to restrain a lawyer from acting, in order to prevent confidence in the administration of justice from being undermined (see <span class="font-italic">Harsha</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [78] and [81]). For instance, r 21 of the PCR provides that a legal practitioner owes duties of loyalty and confidentiality to his current client and former client and must act prudently to avoid any compromise of the lawyer-client relationship by reason of a conflict or potential conflict between the interests of his current client and his former client. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In determining whether the court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction, the applicable test is “whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that the legal practitioner be restrained from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process including the appearance of justice” (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>”) at [65]). The relevant cases where the court has considered exercising its supervisory jurisdiction to regulate the conduct of a lawyer are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Williamson </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Nilant</span> [2002] WASC 225 (“<span class="font-italic">Williamson</span>”), the Supreme Court of Western Australia granted an injunction to restrain solicitors from acting for the liquidators of a company, because one of the shareholders of the company was also a client of the same solicitors. The court held (at [26]) that the “conflict which may arise between the interests of [the shareholder], which the solicitor must legitimately advance, and the necessity to give impartial advice and representation to the liquidator of [the company] is such that the interests of justice require the solicitor be restrained from acting for the liquidator”. However, the court acknowledged (at [22]) that “[c]ases will differ” and “not every case where a solicitor acts for a liquidator and a party interested in the liquidation will there be a conflict”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another </span>[2012] 2 SLR 451 (“<span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Khoon</span>”), the High Court held (at [22]) that where only breaches of the PCR are concerned, which do not trigger any concurrent breach of legal obligations owed by the counsel to the court or the client at common law, the proper forum for investigation and determination of the breach is the Law Society rather than the court, unless the court’s supervisory jurisdiction is engaged. The court’s intervention is required, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where “matters impinge on the proper administration of justice, due process and wider public interest issues”. The court cited (at [21]) the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Prince </span><span class="font-italic">Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a firm)</span> [1999] 2 AC 222 (at 234–235) as one such instance. The House of Lords emphasised that an injunction will be granted to restrain lawyers from acting in the limited situation where: (i) the lawyer acted against a present client; and (ii) if there is potential or possible misuse of confidential information obtained by a lawyer from a former client. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>, the Court of Appeal considered (at [70]) that although the application for injunctions to restrain the lawyers from acting for the applicants’ judicial managers was based on the law of confidence, there may have been “a broader case engaging the supervisory jurisdiction of the court”. The relevant facts are that: (i) the lawyers had acted for the applicants since the 1990s and accumulated knowledge about them and the companies in which they had interests; and (ii) the spectacle that the lawyers may have “changed sides” during the course of restructuring of the companies may undermine the appearance that justice is being done (at [71]–[72]). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the court emphasised (at [74]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… we are not holding that the court’s supervisory jurisdiction should be invoked in this case but only that the circumstances disclosed thus far indicate that the [applicants’] ground to invoke this jurisdiction is not wholly unsustainable or devoid of basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Although a liquidator must act independently and fairly in a voluntary liquidation, such that he cannot be open to influence from the appointing directors (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22]), the present case is not one where the court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to regulate the conduct of Mr Lim in acting for the applicants. First, the facts of the present application do not fall within the situations envisioned in <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Khoon</span>. Although the defendants are right that Mr Lim had previously acted for the Company and is now acting for the applicants, who are the liquidators of the Company, there is no evidence that Mr Lim had acted against the applicants, or misused confidential information provided to him by the Company previously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, in applying the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>, the threshold for the court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction has not been engaged. At first glance, the facts of the present application appear similar to <span class="font-italic">Williamson</span>. However, that case involves a lawyer purporting to simultaneously act for two clients with potentially conflicting interests. In the present application, however, given that Mr Lim has ceased to act for the Company, I do not think there is any evidence of potential or actual conflict of interest that warrants the court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendants can rely on the documents exhibited in their affidavits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I turn now to consider if the defendants can rely on the documents exhibited in their affidavits. To begin with, O 3 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021 provides that “[a] document which is not in the English language must be accompanied by a translation in the English language certified by a court interpreter or verified by an affidavit of a person qualified to translate the document”. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Shi Wen Yue v Shi </span><span class="font-italic">Minjiu and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 911 (at [7]) explained that this procedural requirement makes clear that “[n]either an [Assistant Registrar] nor a judge is in a position to offer his own translation … as he is neither a court interpreter nor a person qualified to translate foreign text”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this regard, in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [55]), the High Court held that some of the documents adduced by one party were in French, and the English translations thereof had not been certified. Because these documents did not comply with O 92 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2004 Rev Ed), they could not be used in the court proceedings there. Similarly, in the District Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Universal Success Group Limited v Chung Cheong Weng t/a Sin </span><span class="font-italic">Intergro </span>[2022] SGDC 63 (at [14]), the court declined to admit WeChat messages in Chinese because they had not been translated pursuant to O 92 r 1 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (the “ROC 2014”). O 92 r 1 of the ROC 2014 is substantially similar to O 3 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021, as the former provides that “[e]very document if not in the English language must be accompanied by a translation thereof certified by a court interpreter or a translation verified by the affidavit of a person qualified to translate it before it may be received, filed or used in the [c]ourt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 However, there are two exceptions to this procedural requirement: (a) where the defendants waived their objection to compliance (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Reemtsma</span><span class="font-italic"> Cigarettenfabriken GmbH v Hugo Boss AG</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 469 at [7]); and (b) where the document is predominantly in the English language such that a translation certificate is unnecessary (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee Kuan</span> [2019] 4 SLR 577 at [122]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, I agree with the applicants that the court should decline the use of the documents in the defendants’ exhibits that do not comply with O 3 r 7(2) of the ROC 2021. These documents have been translated from the German language to the English language, but they have not been certified by a court interpreter or a person qualified to translate the documents. Further, the applicants have not waived their objection to compliance with O 3 r 7(2), and neither are the documents predominantly in the English language so as to render translation in compliance with O 3 r 7(2) unnecessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 These documents include:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  2nd Affidavit of Andreas Dieter Vogel dated 18 May 2023 for OA 220 at pp 60–65.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I leave aside the issue of translation and assume that the court can rely on this LOE. Even then, the services “regarding the Singapore company incorporation” were to be provided to CST GmbH, and not the Company. Further, there is no evidence that CST GmbH entered into the LOE on behalf of the Company. Not only is the Company not expressly named anywhere in the LOE, but there is also no extrinsic evidence demonstrating as such. In the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Cosmic Insurance</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp Ltd v Khoo Chiang Poh </span>[1979-1980] SLR(R) 703, the court found that there was a letter showing that the parties’ intention was for the company to be bound by the contract after its incorporation and there was a company resolution passed to bind the company to the pre-incorporation contract. In contrast, there is no indicia of any such intention in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, the LOE was not ratified by the Company after its incorporation on 28 December 2010. The defendants have not adduced any evidence of express ratification by the Company. Further, the request for AVPLLP to re-issue the invoices to the Company instead of CST GmBH does not constitute implied ratification. For there to be implied ratification, the company must do an unequivocal act indicating its willingness to be bound by the pre-incorporation contract (see <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin </span><span class="font-italic">Chuee </span>at [73]). In <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin </span><span class="font-italic">Chuee</span>, the High Court held (at [73]) that the payment of salaries by the company did not amount to an unequivocal act, because the conduct may be “interpreted in some other way”. Similarly, in the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Forman</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Proprietary, Ltd v The Ship “Liddesdale”</span> [1900] AC 190 (at 204), the court held that there was no implied ratification by the mere fact that the defendant took the ship and sold it, because this was his own property and he made the best he could of it, which could not give the plaintiffs any additional right. The court contrasted this with the situation where a party accepted goods that were not previously its property, which may amount to implied ratification. In the present application, the request to AVPLLP does not constitute an unequivocal act indicating AVPLLP’s (and all of the defendants’) willingness to be bound by the LOE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Accordingly, the Company is not bound by the LOE. Therefore, the defendants may not recover its debt based on the LOE.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether AVPL has a claim in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">quantum meruit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I turn finally to consider if AVPL has a claim in <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal </span>[2016] 4 SLR 728 (at [37]–[41]), there is a distinction between contractual <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>and restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>, although whether the term “<span class="font-italic">quantum </span><span class="font-italic">meruit</span>” is appropriate for describing a contractual claim remains an unresolved issue. For contractual <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>, it is premised on an implied contract or an implied term. For restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>, it is premised on unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I agree with the applicants’ submissions that the claim in <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>– whether in contractual <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> or restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>– <span class="font-italic">does</span> <span class="font-italic">not</span> change the analysis of AVPL’s proof of debt. First, for the claim in contractual <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>, I agree with the applicants that AVPL was likely relying on the fee quotations sent to the directors in an email dated 2 June 2022 to suggest that there is an implied contract or an implied term that the Company is obliged to pay AVPL for the services it allegedly rendered. However, because this claim is a contractual one, s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LA will apply to bar claims on or before 6 June 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  Second, for the claim in restitutionary<span class="font-italic"> quantum merui</span><span class="font-italic">t</span>, I agree with the applicants that AVPL’s claim is also a contractual one. This is because for claims in unjust enrichment, the court will consider the civil wrong which gave rise to the remedial response in unjust enrichment (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Esben Finance </span>at [73]). Indeed, where the underlying cause of action for the claim is the breach of contract, the limitation period as set out in s 6(1)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LA should apply even when a restitutionary remedy is sought (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Esben Finance </span>at [73], citing Graham Virgo,<span class="font-italic"> The Principles </span><span class="font-italic">of the Law of Restitution</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2015) at pp 738–739). Therefore, s 6(1)<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LA will apply to bar claims on or before 6 June 2015. Accordingly, the analysis regarding the claims that are time barred under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LA (see [47]–[48] above) apply equally here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendants have discharged their burden of proving their debts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 With the above substantive issues in mind, I turn now to consider if the defendants have discharged <span class="font-italic">their </span>burden of proving their debts. As a starting point, since the defendants are “creditors” for the purposes of the disputed debts, they bear the burden of proving their debts on a balance of probabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]). However, this does not mean that the only means by which creditors can prove a proof of debt is through the production of primary documents, because the primary documents may be destroyed or lost due to the effluxion of time (see <span class="font-italic">Fustar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In short, for the reasons that I provide below, I agree with the applicants that the defendants have failed to discharge this burden in the present application. I address the proof of debt of each defendant in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">AVPLLP’s proof of debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, for AVPLLP’s proof of debt, it claimed that the debt was incurred between 15 November 2018 and 31 May 2021.
