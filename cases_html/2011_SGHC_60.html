        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal touches on an issue of significant
                    legal interest – whether, in divorce proceedings under the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”), in making a
                    judgment of nullity, the court can make orders for maintenance for the female
                    party and for the division of the parties’ assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties and proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The petitioner/appellant in these proceedings is
                    ADP (“the Appellant”) and the respondent is ADQ (“the
                    Respondent”). They will be referred to collectively as “the
                    parties”. They were married in Hong Kong on 26 October 1995
                    (“the Hong Kong marriage”), and had a child, B in 1997. At the
                    time of the Hong Kong marriage, the Appellant already had a child, C from a
                    previous relationship with one D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant was previously married to one E in
                    Japan in 1989 (“the Japanese marriage”). The Japanese marriage had
                    broken down by the time the Appellant and the Respondent contracted the Hong
                    Kong marriage. At that time, the Appellant was informed by E (whom she believed)
                    that the Japanese marriage had been dissolved around June 1995, but that was not
                    legally accurate because under Japanese law a divorce is not final for a period
                    of six months and the divorce was thus only finalised on 7 December 1995.
                    The unfortunate result of the Appellant’s mistaken belief was that she was
                    still married to E when she contracted the Hong Kong marriage, and that the Hong
                    Kong marriage was void because the laws of Hong Kong do not allow bigamous
                    marriages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties came to know about this legal
                    impediment when their own marriage had broken down, and they were in the midst
                    of divorce proceedings. The discovery complicated and slowed down the progress
                    of the proceedings. At this time, it is not necessary to list the various steps
                    taken, except to state that at the hearing of the present Divorce Petition on
                    15 August 2006, the Family Court declared the Hong Kong marriage void on
                    the ground that the Appellant was already married when she contracted the Hong
                    Kong marriage, and the Court directed that the ancillary matters (including the
                    Appellant’s claim for maintenance for herself and for C, and for a
                    division of matrimonial assets) be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Those matters came on for hearing before a
                    District Judge (“the DJ”) in 2009 who ruled:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The Court does not have powers to order payment of
                            maintenance to the petitioner or deal with the division of assets in
                            view of the fact that a judgment for nullity has been granted on the
                            ground that the marriage is void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The respondent is not liable to maintain
                        C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The DJ’s reasons for ruling (a) above
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     in the case of a void marriage no
                        marriage is in existence;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant had not acquired the
                        status of a wife that is necessary for the court to order payment of
                        maintenance to her under s 113 (all the statutory provisions referred
                        to hereafter are provisions of the Charter); <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     when a marriage is void, there is no
                        marriage and the court has no power to order the division of matrimonial
                        assets under s 112 even though it has the jurisdiction to grant a
                        judgment of nullity in respect of the void marriage<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Courts’ power to order maintenance and division of matrimonial
                assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The courts derive the power to order maintenance
                    and effect a division of matrimonial assets under ss 112(1) and 113.
                    Section 112(1) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                        judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
                        the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
                        such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
                        of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
                        equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and s 113 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or
                        former wife —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) during the course of any matrimonial proceedings; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce,
                            judicial separation or nullity of marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The bare reference to “nullity of
                    marriage” in s 112(1) has given rise to uncertainty because two
                    classes of marriages come within the term, void marriages and voidable
                    marriages, and there is a significant conceptual distinction between
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Nullity of marriage is dealt with under
                    Part X Chapter 3 of the Charter. The first provision thereof,
                    s 104, provides that any husband or wife may file a writ claiming for a
                    judgment of nullity in respect of his or her marriage. Section 105 then
                    sets out the grounds which render a marriage void. (The present case is
                    concerned with one ground, that the marriage is solemnised when one of the
                    parties is already married.) Section 106 sets out the grounds which render
                    a marriage voidable. Reading these three sections together, it is clear that a
                    judgment of nullity may be made in respect of a void marriage or a voidable
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The difference between a void and a voidable
                    marriage is explained with admirable clarity in an article by D Tolstoy,
                    “Void and Voidable Marriages” (1964) 27 MLR 385. At pp 385
                    – 386, Tolstoy wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is now a clear distinction between a void and a voidable marriage. A
                        void marriage is one which, owing to the presence of an impediment at the
                        time of the ceremony, will be regarded by every court in any case in which
                        the existence of the marriage is in issue as never having taken place and
                        can be so treated by both parties to it without the necessity of any decree
                        annulling it; the decree in the case of a void marriage is in essence a
                        declaration that no marriage had come into existence and any person having
                        sufficient interest in a declaration of nullity can petition for a decree at
                        any time, even after the death of one or both parties. A voidable marriage
                        is one that will be regarded by every court as a valid, subsisting marriage
                        until a decree annulling it has been pronounced by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction, which can be done only at the instigation of one of the
                        parties during the lifetime of both parties. Thus, in the case of a void
                        marriage, no valid marriage ever comes into existence and the parties to it
                        never acquire the status of husband and wife, whereas in the case of a
                        voidable marriage the parties acquire that status and the marriage is valid
                        unless and until annulled during the joint lives of the parties at the
                        instance of one of them. It follows, therefore, that if one party dies
                        without a decree of nullity having been pronounced the voidable marriage
                        cannot thereafter be questioned, but is for ever valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage was cited by Judith Prakash J in <em>Tan Ah Thee and another (administrators of the estate of Tan Kiam Poh
                        (alias Tan Gna Chua), deceased) v Lim Soo Foong</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R)
                    957.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     A similar view on void marriages is taken by
                    Professor Leong Wai Kum in her book, <em>Elements of Family Law
                        in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2007) (“<em>Elements</em>”) where she stated at p 38:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the marriage is void, the marital relationship that would have been
                        created between the spouses, which was the purpose of forming the marriage,
                        is not created. The parties are therefore still unmarried persons and free
                        to marry anyone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When the Charter refers to “nullity of
                    marriage” in s 112(1), did that have the effect of doing away with
                    the distinction between a void marriage and a voidable marriage? The wording of
                    the provision offers no indication. In the case of the dissolution of a
                        <em>voidable</em> marriage, assets acquired up to the
                    dissolution are matrimonial assets, and the court has the power to order the
                    division of matrimonial assets in the course of dissolving such a marriage. The
                    question is whether a court is empowered to make orders for the division of
                    matrimonial assets when dissolving a <em>void</em> marriage
                    with a judgment of nullity, when in law, there has not been a marriage, and the
                    assets acquired by the parties cannot be matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is noted by Professor Leong Wai Kum that
                    there is no case that determined whether the exercise of the court’s
                    powers under s 112 and s 113 should be attenuated where a marriage is
                    void (see <em>Elements</em> at p 76). It can be added
                    that there is also nothing in the official record of the parliamentary debates
                    which touches on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There are strong reasons which suggest that
                    this issue is not best resolved on a “yes” or “no”
                    basis. A marriage can be rendered void for different reasons. Even if we
                    restrict ourselves to the present case where a marriage that is void because one
                    party is already married when the marriage is contracted, a party’s
                    knowledge and culpability may vary. A party may have acted in good faith out of
                    ignorance or that party may have acted with full knowledge of the impediment and
                    with the intention to deceive the legal authorities and the other party.
                    Following from that, the nullity of the marriage ought to have different effects
                    according to the facts. For example, an innocent party may be accorded rights
                    and liabilities as though the marriage was legal, and a “guilty”
                    party may be denied of any rights, and be subject to the liabilities. Needless
                    to say, there will be many variations to the facts which require the different
                    treatments, and legal, sociological and public policy considerations will have
                    to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is not appropriate for a court to
                    extrapolate an answer as these matters should be addressed by the legislature. I
                    will therefore focus my attention on the governing provisions of the law.
                    Section 112(1) states that the court shall have the power to order a
                    division of <em>matrimonial</em> assets. Against the
                    backdrop that a void marriage is not a marriage, the parties were not in a state
                    of matrimony and there can be no matrimonial assets to be divided. If the assets
                    that are acquired in the course of the relationship have to be divided, that can
                    be done on the application of property contract, trust or other relevant
                    principles of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Similarly, when s 113 states that a court
                    may order a man to pay maintenance to his <em>wife</em> or
                        <em>former wife</em>, that is predicated on the
                    claimant being one or the other. In the case of a void marriage, the claimant is
                    neither. Even if we assume that the court can overlook that as a technicality,
                    there is no one correct solution. A ‘wife’ who is unaware of the
                    impediment would have a moral claim for maintenance, but a ‘wife’
                    who suppressed the impediment so as to deceive the other party and the marriage
                    authorities would have a weak claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the circumstances, I affirm the DJ’s
                    approach to the question, and I uphold her ruling that the Appellant is not
                    entitled to maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It must be a disappointment for the Appellant
                    to be denied her claim when she was unaware of her impediment (it would have
                    been worse if the marriage was void because of the Respondent’s impediment
                    or deception). Can there be any other basis for a person like the Appellant to
                    seek maintenance? It may be argued that an innocent party may seek maintenance
                    although there is no marriage in law if the parties had maintained their
                    relationship in the belief that there was a legal marriage with the attendant
                    rights and liabilities with regard to maintenance. As the Appellant had not made
                    her claim on the basis and this was not brought up or argued, this possibility
                    must remain as food for thought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The next issue is the claim for maintenance
                    for C. There is some background to this claim. The Appellant had made an
                    application for interim maintenance in the proceedings and had obtained an order
                    that the Respondent was to pay maintenance of US$1,300 a month for C and US$300
                    a month for the joint expenses for C and B. The Respondent appealed against the
                    order and a Judge of the High Court (“the Judge”) set aside the
                    order on the ground that the Respondent is not liable to maintain C as she is
                    not his child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This claim comes under two sections:
                    s 70(1) and s 127(1). Section 127(1) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the pendency of any matrimonial proceedings or when granting or at
                        any time subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial
                        separation or nullity of marriage, the court may order a parent to pay
                        maintenance for the benefit of his child in such manner as the court thinks
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In construing s 127(1), two definitions apply. Section 122
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In this Chapter</em>, wherever the context so
                        requires, “child” means a child of the marriage as defined in
                        section 92 but who is below the age of 21 years. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and “child of the marriage” is defined in s 92
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... any <em>child of the husband and wife</em>, and
                        includes any adopted child and any other child (whether or not a child of
                        the husband or of the wife) who was <em>a member of the
                            family</em> of the husband and wife at the time when they ceased
                        to live together or at the time immediately preceding the institution of the
                        proceedings, whichever first occurred; and for the purposes of this
                        definition, the parties to a purported marriage that is void shall be deemed
                        to be husband and wife; [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the purpose of s 127(1), a child can either be a child of the
                    couple or a child who is accepted as a member of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Under s 70(1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a person has accepted a child who is <em>not his
                            child</em> as a <em>member of his
                        family</em>, it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he
                        remains a child, so far as the father or the mother of the child fails to do
                        so, and the court may make such orders as may be necessary to ensure the
                        welfare of the child. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The definition of “child” in s 122 does not apply
                    to s 70(1) because s 70(1) is not in the same chapter of the Charter
                    as s 122. The “child” in s 70(1) is a child who is not a
                    child of the couple, but has been accepted as a member of the
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The DJ dismissed the application for
                    maintenance for C at the conclusion of the proceedings. She stated in her
                    grounds of decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45.    The [Appellant] contended that the [Respondent]
                            had accepted [C] as his child initially and it was only during the
                            present nullity proceedings that he disputed that [C] is a child of the
                            family. Counsel claimed that as [the Judge’s] order was made
                            pursuant to interim proceedings this court is not estopped from making
                            final orders for maintenance for [C] at the ancillary
                        hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46.    I noted that it is in the same proceedings that
                            this issue has been raised and argued. The High Court has made a
                            decision on a substantive point. In the circumstances, res judicata
                            applies and the [Appellant] is estopped from further raising this
                            issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    Further, this being an order of the High Court, I
                            am bound by it. I therefore reiterated [the Judge’s] order by
                            ordering that the respondent is not liable to maintain
                        [C].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The DJ had rejected the claim solely on the
                    basis that the claim was disbarred under the doctrine of <em>res
                        judicata</em>, but the correctness of her decision is
                    questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In her reference to <em>res
                        judicata</em>, the DJ was referring to issue estoppel that prohibits a
                    party from raising an issue which has been determined conclusively. Issue
                    estoppel was discussed and explained by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata
                        Title Plan No 301</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157, where it held
                    (at [14] – [15]) that for issue estoppel to arise four conditions must be
                    fulfilled:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     there must be a final and conclusive
                        judgment <em>on the merits of the issue</em> which is
                        said to be the subject of the estoppel;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     that judgment must be by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     the parties in the two actions being compared must be identical;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     there must be
                        identity of subject matter in the two actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The first condition was further explained in
                        <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 453 by Sundaresh Menon JC (at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finality for the purposes of <em>res judicata</em>
                        simply refers to a declaration or determination of a party's liability
                        and/or his rights or obligations leaving nothing else to be judicially
                        determined: [K R Handley, <em>Spencer Bower, Turner and
                            Handley: The Doctrine of Res Judicata</em> (Butterworths, 3rd Ed,
                        1996)] at para 154. Whether the decision in question is a final and
                        conclusive judgment on the merits may be ascertained <em>from
                            the intention of the judge</em> as gathered from the relevant
                        documents filed, the order made and the notes of any evidence taken or
                        arguments made. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is quite clear that the first condition was
                    not satisfied. The Judge’s finding that C is not the Respondent’s
                    child did not address the question of her being a member of the family. That
                    decision was not a judgment on the merits of the issue of her entitlement to
                    maintenance because C could be entitled to maintenance if she is a member of the
                    family, without being the Respondent’s child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The DJ’s summary rejection of the claim
                    for maintenance for C on the basis of issue estoppel is set aside and the claim
                    is remitted to her to be decided on its merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In view of the mixed results, each party
                    should bear its own costs in the appeal.</p>
