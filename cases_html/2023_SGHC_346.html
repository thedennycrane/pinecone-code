This also applies to an originating application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As to the legal onus in a striking out application, I agree with the Applicants that it falls on the AG, as the applicant in SUM3096, and not the Applicants, to show that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> reasonable cause of action (<span class="font-italic">Leong </span><span class="font-italic">Quee Ching Karen </span>at [26], [36], [57]). That said, although an application on this ground must be very clearly justified by the party applying to strike out, given that the test under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is whether the pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action, the respondent nonetheless bears some onus of demonstrating that theirs is a reasonable cause of action with a prospect of success (<span class="font-italic">Richland Trade &amp; Development v United Malayan Banking </span>[1996] 4 MLJ 233 at pp 244 and 249).

With these applicable legal principles in mind, I turn to the first issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the Applicants have met the threshold requirements for the application</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As held in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [72] and [115] and <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1 at [16], the three elements which must be met for an applicant to possess <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring an action for declaratory relief in constitutional challenges are as set out in <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v </span><span class="font-italic">Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 (“<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span>”). These are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicant must have a “real interest” in bringing the action (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span> at [19]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must be a “real controversy” between the parties for the court to resolve (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span> at [19]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The declaration must relate to a right which is personal to the applicant and which is enforceable against an adverse party to the litigation (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span> at [15], [16] and [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In respect of these requirements, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hong </span>provided the following clarifications. First, the element of “real controversy” is a matter that goes towards the discretion of the court, rather than jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">an Eng Hong </span>at [115] and [137]). This requirement ensures that the person seeking declaratory relief has a real interest in doing so, that they are able to secure a proper contradictor who has a true interest to <span class="font-italic">oppose</span> the declaration sought, and furthermore prevents the court from being distracted by having to deal with theoretical issues from deciding real, subsisting problems (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [132]). Second, for the “real interest” requirement, sufficiency of interest is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>made out once there is a violation of constitutional rights (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [83] and [115]). Third, for the requirement that there must be a violation of “a personal right”, as every constitutional right is a personal right, demonstrating that a constitutional right has been violated will suffice (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [80] and [115]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On this last point, the Court of Appeal further opined that “a violation of constitutional rights <span class="font-italic">may </span>be brought about by the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [115]). Relying on this and a similar statement at [110], and other observations in the case, the Applicants argue that the fact that the impugned provisions are in the statute books, <span class="font-italic">without more, </span>gives rise to an arguable case of a violation of their constitutional rights. Having considered the Applicants’ submissions, however, I am unable to agree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, the plain fact of the matter is that these impugned provisions do not as yet have legal effect. Given that the provisions are not operational, I find that they do not engage the Applicants’ constitutional rights, or for that matter, any other of their legal rights and interests. To put it another way, should any of the Applicants wish to make any post-appeal applications at all to the courts at present, they do not have to contend with the impugned provisions, or the PACC Act, at all. Contrary to what Mr Masoud asserted at para 8 of the Affidavit, his “right to move the court” is by no means<span class="font-italic"> </span>“obstructed or hindered by [the impugned provisions]” (see [9(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, and as pointed out by the AG, the mere prospect of the PACC Act becoming operative in the <span class="font-italic">future</span> does not suffice to establish standing for OA987. At the hearing, Mr Iskandar argued that it would only be a matter of time before the law is in force. He did not see the difference between arguing the matter now, or later in the future. In response, the AG replied that even if the law were to come into force sometime in the future, that does not mean that the strict requirements for a constitutional challenge should be ignored. The Applicants must show a violation of their constitutional rights <span class="font-italic">now</span>, and not merely a violation of such rights in the future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On this, I agree with the AG. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee v Attorney-General and other appeals </span>[2022] 1 SLR 1347 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span>”), the repealed s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) was held to be legally unenforceable, owing to representations made by the AG that it would not be enforced (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [148]–[149]). While this would only be so until the Government gave clear notice that it intended to reassert its right to enforce s 377A by way of prosecution, until it did, there was no controversy and no real threat of prosecution, and the appellants therefore did not have standing to pursue their constitutional challenges (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [153] and [330]). Thus, even though a law might be on the books and might gain or regain its legal effect upon some act on the part of the Executive, until it did, and so long as it remains legally unenforceable, there can be no real and credible threat of infringement of rights, and consequently no standing to challenge its constitutionality. Taking the Applicants’ case at its highest, even if it can be shown for certain that the Applicants <span class="font-italic">will</span> have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>once the operative date of the impugned provisions is made known, before such a time, this does not suffice to ground <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>for OA987. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Third, even if the PACC Act <span class="font-italic">were</span> in force, and even if it <span class="font-italic">were </span>unconstitutional as alleged by the Applicants, this would not necessarily suffice for them to have standing to mount a constitutional challenge. To explain this, it is important to set out in some detail the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span>. First, the Court of Appeal observed that constitutional rights are personal to all citizens. However, the mere holding of a constitutional right is insufficient to found standing to challenge an unconstitutional law. There must, said the Court of Appeal, be a violation of the constitutional right (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [93]). Such violation may be more easily demonstrated where the law specifically targets a group, and an applicant falls within the group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, whether the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books suffices to show a violation of constitutional rights “depends on what exactly that law provides” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span> at [94]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span> took pains to emphasise that the court did not “lay down a general rule that the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books suffices to demonstrate a violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights”. Each case must turn on its own facts, and the courts are to remain mindful that lax standing rules could “seriously curtail the efficiency of the Executive in practising good governance” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [109]). Moreover, the Court of Appeal observed that while “it is conceivable that the very existence of an unconstitutional law in the statute books suffices” to make out a violation of a person’s constitutional rights and thus standing, this would be an “extraordinary” and “rare” case, and “no such case has ever been brought to the attention of the courts here (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [94] and [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 By the above, the question is whether this is the extraordinary and rare case which the Court of Appeal had in mind. At the hearing, Mr Masoud asserted that it is, because the PACC Act targets PACPs, and the Applicants are PACPs. In reply, the AG contended that even if this is so, a violation is not <span class="font-italic">conclusively</span> shown by the mere fact that an allegedly unconstitutional law appears to target a group. One key factor for consideration is what exactly the law provides, and it is to this that I turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The impugned provisions are aspects of a new procedure. As observed by the AG at the hearing, by way of contrast, s 377A of the Penal Code, which was also the subject matter in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span>, prescribed a criminal offence, and entailed the possible arrest, detention and prosecution of individuals. Being procedural in nature,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the impugned provisions do not lay down any substantive law; they do not affect any substantive rights. In the criminal context, the implication of a possible violation arising from a procedural law is completely different from a possible violation of a substantive law. Substantive criminal law may affect the conduct of private citizens by holding would-be violators <span class="font-italic">in terrorem</span>, and its effects may thus be felt even in the absence of an actual prosecution (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span> at [110]). However, the same cannot be said of procedural law. While the courts have emphasised that a person should not have to break the law in order to establish standing to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional law that is substantive in nature, where a procedural law is being challenged, similar concerns do not apply. Considering the nature of the impugned provisions, their mere enactment, in my view, without more, does not suffice to demonstrate a violation of the Applicants’ constitutional rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Accordingly, I do not consider this to be an exceptional and rare case, where the mere existence of the impugned provisions in the statute books suffices to show a violation of constitutional rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Along the same vein, there is no “real controversy” between the parties for the court to resolve. Preliminarily, while the AG’s written and oral submissions appear to have treated this as a threshold requirement distinct from that of standing,

</div> from the test endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span>, as laid out<span class="font-italic"> </span>above at [24],<span class="font-italic"> </span>the question of a real controversy goes towards the ultimate threshold issue of standing. Indeed, at least insofar as constitutional rights are concerned, it would appear that the question of a real controversy is closely related to that of a violation of rights, with both at times being dealt with in the same breath (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [153]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In any event, nothing ultimately turns on this in the present case. Insofar as nothing that has arisen or happened thus far has affected the Applicants’ rights, there can be no real controversy in respect of the PACC Act, whether of fact or law. At present, the Applicants are able to make any application they wish before the courts, without having to contend with the PACC Act. It bears remembering that the need for the existence of a real controversy stems from the function of the courts as being to adjudicate on and determine disputes between parties, rather than to give advisory opinions on abstract, hypothetical and/or academic questions (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [132]). This element is not satisfied, as the challenge remains theoretical in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 To round off, I note that the AG does not submit on the “real interest” requirement, being the third element to establish <span class="font-italic">locus standi. </span>In the context of constitutional rights, much like the real controversy requirement, this is closely intertwined with the question of whether a violation has occurred. As noted above at [25], sufficiency of interest is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> made out once there is a violation of a constitutional right (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [83]). This issue may therefore be dealt with very briefly. In the main, the Applicants rely on the violation of their constitutional rights to establish a “real interest” in bringing the action (see [26] above). As they have failed to show a violation of their constitutional rights, they are also unable to meet the “real interest” requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In view of the findings that the Applicants do not meet any of the three requirements for <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>for OS987, there is no reasonable cause of action disclosed. On this ground alone, I would order OA987 to be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether there is a viable claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For completeness, I turn to the second issue, whether the claim is bound to fail. I deal with the contentions in relation to Arts 9 and 12 separately.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Art 9 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Art 9(1) of the Constitution states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The AG contends that the features contained in the impugned provisions <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>that the Court of Appeal considers the reasonable prospect of success of a PACC application in deciding whether to grant PACC permission, and the power to summarily deal with such an application, are familiar features within the legal system, whether in the context of capital cases or otherwise. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>”) at [49], the AG submits that given that PACPs have reached the very tail end of the criminal process, the principle of finality must be given greater prominence, and that concluded appeals should not be readily susceptible to challenge. It is not difficult to see why a process is put in place to sieve out frivolous post-appeal applications through the grant of permission. It is hopeless for the Applicants to argue that these provisions are inconsistent “with the right to fair trial and access to justice”, and therefore infringe Art 9 of the Constitution.

Apart from setting “the bar too high for a leave application concerning capital cases”, it is “also a qualitatively different exercise in which the Court has to predict the outcome of an application, as compared to making an assessment of whether a case, on the face of it, is frivolous or unmeritorious”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I agree with the AG that it cannot be said that the impugned provisions contravene Art 9 of the Constitution for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 First, the right to a fair trial and access to justice cannot be looked at in isolation, but must be considered in light of the part which it plays in the complete judicial process (see <span class="font-italic">Haw Tua Tau and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[1981-1982] SLR(R) 133 at [25]). Here, the new procedure implemented by the PACC Act applies not to the trial stage, but to the post-appeal stage. Time and again, our courts have emphasised that concluded appeals should not be readily susceptible to challenge. Even in cases involving the death penalty, the well-established principle of finality is no less important (<span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> at [50]). As set out at [5] above, the PACC Act is meant to provide a clear procedure for further applications taken out after appeals have been exhausted, where no such applications would normally be possible. Given that this new procedure governs the very tail end of the criminal process, the principle of finality of proceedings gains prominence. The PACC Act provides clarity as to the procedure for post-appeal applications, while implementing features designed to sift out unmeritorious applications. Viewed in this context, the scheme introduced by the PACC Act cannot be said to be violate Art 9 of the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Second, the specific features and standards under attack are not novel ones within the legal system. I turn first to the applicable test to determine whether PACC permission should be granted under s 60G(7)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SCJA. As the AG highlights, a preliminary assessment of the merits of an application is required for an application to commence judicial review by requiring an applicant to show that there is an arguable case of reasonable suspicion in favour of the grant of remedies (see O 24 r 5(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the ROC). In criminal cases, an appeal’s prospect of success is a factor in deciding whether to grant permission for it to be filed out of time (<span class="font-italic">Adeeb Ahmed Khan s/o Iqbal </span><span class="font-italic">Ahmed Khan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] 2 SLR 1197 at [17(c)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Insofar as Mr Masoud suggested that “a reasonable prospect of success” standard requires the court to predict the outcome of case without the full facts being put before it, and insofar as Mr Iskander similarly contended that the court is to act based on its “imagination”, I strongly disagree. By the new procedure, it is contemplated that an applicant should put forth its best and strongest case in the application. The applicant should not withhold any evidence or arguments so as to reserve them for the later stages, be it at an oral hearing for PACC permission, or the full hearing of an PACC application itself. The court is meant to, and should, have before it all the evidence and arguments upon which an applicant intends to rely when applying for PACC permission, and the court will decide whether PACC permission ought to be granted based on such evidence and arguments as advanced by the applicant. There is no question of any coram proceeding based on “prediction” or “imagination”. The argument is flawed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Indeed, Art 9 does not prohibit prescription of tests. While the Applicants may disagree with the formulation ultimately settled on by Parliament, this is a matter rightfully for Parliament to determine. In short, a requirement for an applicant to demonstrate “a reasonable prospect of success” to obtain permission to bring a PACC application cannot be said to violate Art 9 of the Constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I also take the view that the Applicants’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Haevischer</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is misplaced. There, the Canadian Supreme Court dealt with an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, and held generally that an application in a criminal proceeding should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. However, it is important to reiterate that the applicable test in s 60G(7)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) relates to whether PACC permission <span class="font-italic">should be granted</span> (whether the matter is dealt with in a summary manner or at a hearing). It does not set down any test for the <span class="font-italic">summary disposal</span> of the application for PACC permission without an oral hearing. As the AG submitted at the hearing, the Applicants appear to have conflated the two matters.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Next, I turn to the summary process to deal with applications for PACC permission set out in s 60G(8) of the SCJA. During the hearing, Mr Iskandar contended that it is objectionable that by s 60G(8) of the SCJA, an applicant may be denied the right to make oral submissions at a hearing. Mr Iskandar contended that this is a departure from the norm, and it is discriminatory against the Applicants. Citing <span class="font-italic">Newton, David Christopher v Public Prosecutor </span>[2023] SGHC 266 (“<span class="font-italic">Newton David Christopher</span>”) at [13], Mr Iskandar argued that it is the common practice and indeed the norm that, even where written submissions have been filed in advance, parties would be afforded the opportunity to make oral submissions. Oral submissions will often be of considerable assistance to the court if the parties take the opportunity to highlight or emphasise key points, or to meaningfully respond to the arguments raised by the opposing party. At the same time, any misunderstandings, misconceptions, doubts or questions in the mind of the judge can be cleared up and resolved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the comments in <span class="font-italic">Newton David Christopher</span> must be understood in context. There, the hearing was fixed for the accused to plead guilty, and written submissions had been filed by both counsel before the hearing where oral submissions were made on sentencing. One issue of concern was whether the first-instance judge had decided the matter based on the written submissions alone, even before oral submissions had been heard. In this connection, the importance of the oral hearing is highlighted (<span class="font-italic">Newton David Christopher </span>at [13]). Essentially, <span class="font-italic">Newton David Christopher</span> concerns a first instance hearing, and emphasises the importance of considering the oral submissions made at the end of a trial or a plead guilty hearing. These considerations do not apply to post-appeal applications, by which time, as pointed out earlier, an applicant would have exhausted trial and appeal processes (with full hearings accorded to them for those earlier stages).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 To the contrary, it bears highlighting that in the criminal context, the courts may summarily deal with (i) appeals against conviction and/or sentence (see s 384(1) of the CPC); (ii) applications for permission to make a review application (see s 394H(7) of the CPC); (iii) review applications (see s 394I(10) of the CPC); and (iv) applications for leave to refer a question of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal (see s 397(3B) of the CPC). Indeed, Art 9 does not dictate that a right to a fair hearing must invariably entail the right to be heard at an oral hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Likewise, by the new procedure, an applicant is not prevented from presenting his full materials (including evidence and arguments) for the consideration of the Court of Appeal, despite the application for PACC permission coming at the tail end of the criminal process. Indeed, before summarily refusing an application, the Court of Appeal must give proper consideration to the four matters set out in s 60G(7) of the SCJA. If there is new material adduced by an applicant which could not have been adduced earlier even with reasonable diligence, that would be an important consideration. Even without an oral hearing, there is no doubt that an applicant is accorded a right to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Third, and related to the above, for very much the same reasons, the impugned provisions plainly do not impede access to justice. In fact, as stated above at [5], the PACC Act sets out and clarifies an avenue for PACC applications. If any applicant has a genuine and meritorious claim that has “a reasonable prospect of success”, the Court of Appeal is well in the position to deliver the appropriate remedies. Access to justice does not require a criminal system to allow unmeritorious applications brought at the tail end of the criminal process to progress to the fullest extent. This would be at the expense of judicial and other scarce resources. A balance has been struck by the legislature within the new procedure to allow access to justice, while ensuring proper utilisation of judicial resources, and to preserve the integrity of the judicial process. The impugned provisions form two aspects of this new procedure. Given that PACPs making PACC applications have had their convictions and sentences affirmed by the Court of Appeal, there is no basis for the claim that these safeguards on post-appeal applications are “onerous” and “oppressive”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Accordingly, I find that any Art 9 challenge is without any chance of success.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Art 12 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn next to Art 12 of the Constitution, the second substantive basis for the Applicants’ challenge against the PACC Act. Art 12(1) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All persons are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection of the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In this regard, the test for whether legislation is consistent with Art 12(1) is the “reasonable classification” test, under which a statutory provision prescribing a differentiating measure will be considered consistent with Art 12(1) only if: (a) the classification prescribed is founded on an intelligible differentia (“the first limb”); and (b) that differentia bears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the provision (“the second limb”) (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> [305]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span>, there are two approaches to the reasonable classification test, the first being that in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter</span> [2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span>”), which understood the reasonable classification test as serving the “minimal <span class="font-italic">threshold</span> function of requiring logic and coherence in the [statutory provision] concerned” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang </span>at [66]). Under the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang </span>approach, a provision will fall foul of the first limb if it is unintelligible, either because it is incapable of being apprehended by the intellect or understanding, or because it is so unreasonable that no reasonable person would ever contemplate the differentia concerned as being functional as an intelligible differentia (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [309]–[310]). As for the second limb, the question under the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span> approach is whether the differentia bears a “rational relation” to the legislative object of the statutory provision in question. Such a rational relation will more often than not be found, as a perfect relation or complete coincidence between the differentia and legislative object is not required (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [311]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The second approach to the reasonable classification test is that in <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin v A</span><span class="font-italic">ttorney-General</span> [2021] 1 SLR 809 (“<span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span>”). Under the <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span> approach, the inquiry under the first limb is directed towards simply identifying the purported criterion for differential treatment, “so that its legitimacy may then be assessed properly” under the second limb (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [314]). Unlike the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span> approach, it entails no consideration of the reasonableness (or lack thereof) of the differentia embodied in the statutory provision concerned, <span class="font-italic">even</span> in cases where the differentia is extremely unreasonable (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [315] and [318]). At the <span class="font-italic">second</span> stage of the reasonable classification test, like the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang </span>approach, the <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail </span>approach considers whether the differential treatment is, or whether it bears any rational relation to any conceivable object of the law in question (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [318]–[319]). Unlike the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span> approach, however, it then considers the <span class="font-italic">context</span> in determining how stringently a statutory provision should be scrutinised. While the relationship between the differentia and the object need not be perfect, the court would be averse to any framing of the object of a law which would be tantamount to saying that its object is to introduce differentia which it embodies, as such circular reasoning would render the reasonable classification test purely formalistic and effectively denude Art 12 of real force (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [320], [325]–[326]). Moreover, where the impugned decision is one which affects the individual’s life and liberty to a grave degree, the court would be more searching in its scrutiny (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [325] and [327]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The cumulative effect of these differences is that while the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span> approach regards the reasonable classification test as of a “threshold nature” and is only meant to sift out laws which are patently illogical and/or incoherent, the <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span> approach contemplates a higher level of scrutiny when evaluating whether a statutory provision satisfies the “reasonable classification” test, particularly if the provision has a significant bearing on an individual’s life and liberty (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [328]). The <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span> approach, especially the second limb, is therefore more favourable to the Applicants, and given that the Court of Appeal left it open as to which approach ought to be preferred (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [329]), it is this approach which I turn to consider in determining whether their case discloses a reasonable cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As noted above at [58], under the <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail </span>approach, the first limb is simply concerned with identifying the purported criterion for the differential treatment in question (<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee</span> at [318]). Here, the Applicants argue that the PACC Act “singles out and prescribes further restrictions on PACPs filing applications above and over the existing law that govern post-appeal applications before the PACC Act was enacted, and that apply generally to all post-appeal applications”. The differentia which the Applicants identify therefore appears to be that of prisoners awaiting capital punishment, as opposed to all other prisoners, amongst those wishing to take out post-appeal applications.

</div> In this regard, there is no real difference between the parties. Even if the more stringent first limb of the <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang </span>approach were to be applied, for very much the same reasons set out at [62] below about PACPs, I do not think this differentia is unintelligible, either because it is incapable of being apprehended by the intellect or understanding, or because it is so unreasonable no reasonable person would ever contemplate the differentia concerned as being functional as an intelligible differentia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As for the second limb of the reasonable classification test under the <span class="font-italic">Syed Suhail</span> approach, the AG’s position is that the legislative object of the PACC Act is to prevent abuse of process by PACPs when making PACC applications.

</div> In response, the Applicants argue that the AG’s framing of the object of the PACC Act is tantamount to saying that the object of that law is to introduce the differentia that it embodies.

</div> The PACC Act is therefore “under-inclusive by virtue of singling out PACPs”, and such singling out “cannot be reasonably justified in relation to other post-appeal cases”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In my view, it is clear that the object of the PACC Act, whether as framed by the AG or by the legislature, is not tantamount to being to introduce the very differentia it embodies. Given the grave and final nature of the sentences which PACPs face, they are a class of prisoners who have an incentive to file last minute applications to re-litigate matters which have already been decided, aimed at delaying or frustrating the carrying out of their scheduled sentences. Also, there have been recent instances of them doing so, as compared to other prisoners facing non-capital sentences. Far from being to introduce the differentia for the sake of it, it is clear from the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, as well as the second reading by SPS Rahayu (see [5]-[6] above), that there have been such last-minute applications by PACPs in recent years, and that the purpose of the PACC Act is to address the matter. Be that as it may, taking the Applicants’ case at the highest, even if the legislative object were to prevent abuse of process <span class="font-italic">generally</span>, it need not enjoy a “perfect relation” or “complete coincidence” with the differentia in question to pass muster under the reasonable classification test. The fact that PACPs have been prone to file the applications with which the PACC Act is concerned, suffices to render the relationship more than capable of withstanding scrutiny (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Kee </span>at [325]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Accordingly, the Art 12 challenge has no chance of success. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the foregoing reasons, I find that there is no basis to sustain the constitutional challenge against the impugned provisions which are not in force. The Applicants have no <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to do so. Further, the claim is not viable, and has no chance of success.
