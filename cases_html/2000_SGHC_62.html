<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">1.    The defendant is the

registered owner of premises known as 7Q, Napier Road, Eng Lok Mansion, Singapore. On 14

April 1981, the defendant mortgaged the said property to the plaintiffs to secure advances

made or to be made by the plaintiffs to one Mdm Chow Ai Hwa, the mother of the defendant,

who had an account with the plaintiffs (the "said account"). On 20 April 1998,

the plaintiffs demanded from the defendant the sum owing to the plaintiffs under the said

account. The demand was not met and the plaintiffs in OS 1789/98 instituted proceedings

under Order 83 of the Rules of Court against the defendant for:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) delivery to the plaintiffs of

  possession of the said premises; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) payment of the outstanding sum of

  $402,421.12 together with contractual interest thereon from 11 December 1998 until

  date of full settlement;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">under the terms of the mortgage document.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    On 13 January 1999, Mdm Chow,

purportedly acting under a Power-of-Attorney, entered appearance for the defendant.

Shortly thereafter, Mdm Chow, vide SIC 492 of 1999, applied under Orders 14(4) and 15(4)

of the Rules of Court that she be joined as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in the

Originating Summons. In her supporting affidavit, Mdm Chow alleged that, as this was prime

property for which there had been offers to buy at $1.8 million, the plaintiffs were more

than adequately covered for the advances made to her and they should not therefore be

allowed to take possession of or force the sale of the said property. She also alleged

that the plaintiffs had improperly sold, at considerable loss to her, some $815,880 worth

of Malaysian shares that she had pledged to them as additional security for her loans,

when there was, in the light of the value of the said property, no necessity for them to

have sold the shares.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    Mdm Chow’s application under SIC

492/99 was heard together with the Originating Summons by the Assistant Registrar

("AR") on 15 February 1999. The learned AR dismissed Mdm Chow’s application

in SIC 492/99 to be made a party to the proceedings and granted the plaintiffs prayers in

OS 1789/98.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    Mdm Chow, again purporting to act in

person and on behalf of the defendant, filed a notice of appeal against the decision of

the learned AR in respect of both the Summons-in-Chambers and the Originating Summons (RA

92/99 and 93/99 respectively). Both appeals were heard before me on 19 April 2000. In

arguing the appeal, Mdm Chow made various allegations, most of which were vituperative and

irrelevant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    In an affidavit she had filed, Mdm

Chow had stated that she had never denied her debt to the plaintiffs. Mr Rajah, who

appeared for the plaintiffs, submitted that had Mdm Chow disputed the debt, then perhaps

the court may in its discretion have granted her application in SIC 492/99 to be made a

defendant but, as the debt was admitted, the learned AR was right in having exercised her

discretion not to grant the application. Mr Rajah submitted that, if indeed the

plaintiffs had improperly sold Mdm Chow’s shares as alleged, the appropriate course

of action would be for Mdm Chow to commence separate proceedings against the plaintiffs

and not seek to be made a defendant in this Originating Summons. He therefore urged

me to dismiss the appeal in respect of SIC 492/99.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    With respect to the appeal in respect

of OS 1789/98, Mr Rajah, on a preliminary point, submitted that under s 29 of the

Legal Profession Act, only advocates and solicitors can appear on behalf of others in

these courts. He pointed out that the defendant in these proceedings had not, by himself,

entered appearance, filed any affidavit, engaged any solicitor, appeared before the

learned AR to defend the Originating Summons or appeared in this court to pursue the

appeal. On the substantive merits of the appeal, Mr Rajah pointed out that Mdm Chow’s

only argument appeared to be that the property was worth more than what she owed the

plaintiffs and the judgment obtained by the plaintiffs should therefore be set aside.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    I accepted the submissions of Mr

Rajah. With respect to SIC 492/99 (RA 92/99), as Mdm Chow was not disputing that the

monies claimed by the plaintiffs were in fact owed to the plaintiffs, the learned AR could

not be faulted for not having granted the application. With respect to OS 1789/98 (RA

93/99), the fact that the defendant was not before me either in person or by solicitor to

argue the appeal was, in itself, a sufficient ground to dismiss the appeal. In addition,

Mdm Chow’s complaint, that because the value of the property was much higher than the

sums owed to the plaintiffs, the learned AR should not have granted the prayers in the

Originating Summons, had no merit. I therefore dismissed both appeals and ordered Mdm Chow

to pay costs which I fixed at $2,000.</font></p>
