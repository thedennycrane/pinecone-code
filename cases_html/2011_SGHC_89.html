<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Respondents in this action applied in
                    Summons No 4095 of 2010 for summary judgment against the Appellant, the estate
                    of the late Susanto Lim (“Susanto”), for a total sum of
                    S$133,478,558.52 (as at 15 July 2009) due to the Respondents under a Deed
                    of Personal Guarantee No 284 dated 20 December 2006 (“the
                    PG”). On 14 January 2011, an Assistant Registrar
                    (“AR”) granted summary judgment in favour of the
                    Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant then appealed to this Court in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 18 of 2011 (“RA 18/2011”) to set aside
                    the order made by the AR for summary judgment or, alternatively, to give the
                    Appellant unconditional leave to defend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I heard the appeal on 2 March 2011 and dismissed
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       An appeal has been filed to the Court of Appeal
                    by the Appellant against my decision. I shall state my reasons for my decision
                    after recounting the salient facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       PMA Credit Opportunities Fund, PMA Temple Fund
                    and Diversified Asian Strategies Fund are the First, Second and Third
                    Respondents respectively. They are investment funds registered in the Cayman
                    Islands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Fourth Respondent, Arch Advisory Limited, is
                    a limited liability company incorporated in Labuan and in the business of
                    providing securities, investment advisory and financial planning services. The
                    Fifth Respondent, Goldman Sachs Foreign Exchange (Singapore) Pte, is a limited
                    liability company incorporated in Singapore and in the business of providing
                    financial advisory, securities brokerage and investment management services. The
                    Sixth Respondent, Standard Chartered Bank, is a limited liability company
                    incorporated in England and Wales and in the business of providing banking and
                    other financial services. The Seventh Respondent, Intertrust (Singapore) Limited
                    (formerly known as Fortis Intertrust (Singapore) Limited) is a limited liability
                    company incorporated in Singapore and in the business of providing corporate,
                    private wealth management and other specialised services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant, Tiny Tantono
                    (“Tiny”), is the widow of the late Susanto. Susanto passed away in
                    Singapore on 15 October 2009. By an Order of Court dated 9 April 2010
                    (as varied by an Order of Court dated 27 May 2010), Tiny was joined as a
                    Defendant (now Appellant) in this action as the representative and heir of the
                    estate of the late Susanto. The order further stated that the proceedings in
                    this action be carried on and maintained against Tiny as if she had been
                    substituted for Susanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Susanto was an experienced and wealthy
                    Indonesian businessman, reported by Forbes to be amongst the top 100 richest
                    individuals in Indonesia in 2007. He was the indirect beneficial owner and chief
                    executive officer of the Sawit Mas Group, a conglomerate specialising in
                    oleochemicals and palm oil products.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       By an agreement dated 15 December 2006 (the
                    “Facility Agreement”), the First Respondent extended a US$140
                    million syndicated loan facility (“the Facility”) to one Palm
                    Optics Enterprise Pte Ltd (the “Borrower”). The Borrower is part
                    of the Sawit Mas Group. The Sixth and Seventh Respondents were the Onshore and
                    Offshore Security Agents respectively under the Facility Agreement. The First to
                    Fifth Respondents are Lenders under the Facility Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In consideration for the Facility, Susanto
                    furnished the PG in favour of the Sixth Respondent, acting as a Security Agent
                    for the beneficiaries (defined by Art 1.1 of the PG to include the First to
                    Fifth Respondents and the Seventh Respondent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Article 2 of the PG states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Guarantor ... guarantees to the Security Agent
                            for and on behalf of the Beneficiaries, the due and punctual payment by
                            [the Borrower] of the Secured Obligations and absolutely, irrevocably
                            and unconditionally undertakes to pay the Secured Obligations as his own
                            debt to the Security Agent for and on behalf of the Beneficiaries
                            forthwith upon first written demand by the Security Agent in the
                            currency and in the manner required of the Borrower
                        thereunder.</span></p>

                            indemnity basis) which they (or any one or more of them) may sustain or
                            incur as a consequence of any default or whatsoever nature by [the
                            Borrower] in the performance of the obligations expressed to be assumed
                            by [the Borrower] under or in connection with any Finance

                            Finance Documents, the Guarantor... as primary obligor, and not as
                            sureties only, agrees that the Beneficiaries shall be entitled to
                            recover from the Guarantor all amounts due from [the Borrower] to the
                            Beneficiaries under or in connection with any Finance
                        Document.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In addition, Art 18 of the PG provides that
                    Susanto shall indemnify and hold harmless, on first demand, all of the
                    Respondents against any and all actions, claims, demands, proceedings,
                    judgments, causes of action, losses, liabilities, costs, charges and expenses
                    (including without limitation all services, value added and other duties or
                    taxes payable on such costs, charges and expenses) which may be suffered or
                    incurred by any of them as a result of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     any breach of warranties or
                        undertakings made or assumed by Susanto under the PG;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     the existence or use of rights
                        conferred on, amongst others, the Respondents under the PG;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the perfection,
                        exercise, enforcement or the preservation of any rights under the PG, or any
                        other matter arising out of or in connection with the
                PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Art 24 of the PG provides that the PG shall be
                    governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Tiny signed a Spousal Consent to the PG on the
                    day that Susanto signed the PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Following the execution of the Facility
                    Agreement, the Borrower drew down the following sums under the Facility
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     on or about 7 and 14 February
                        2007, the sums of US$56 million and US$2 million respectively under a
                        facility; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     on or about 7 February 2007, the sum of US$70 million under another
                        facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On or about 7 November 2008, an amount of
                    US$1,508,000 of principal and US$2,876,001.93 of interest fell due and payable
                    under the Facility Agreement. The Borrower defaulted on its obligation under the
                    Facility Agreement to pay the sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Despite demands made by the Seventh
                    Respondent, as a Security Agent, on 19 November 2008 and 6 January
                    2009 to the Borrower (copied to Susanto), the Borrower failed to satisfy the
                    outstanding amounts due. By Notices of Demand dated 5 May 2009 and
                    13 May 2009 issued by the Sixth Respondent, as a Security Agent, to
                    Susanto, the Respondents demanded payment from Susanto of the sum of
                    US$122,780,000 and interest of US$6,656,517.27 then due and outstanding under
                    the Facility for which he was liable under the PG. Susanto did not respond to
                    the Notices of Demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Consequently, on 3 August 2009, this
                    action was formally commenced against Susanto. He entered an appearance through
                    his then solicitors Drew &amp; Napier LLC on 22 September 2009. However, on
                    15 October 2009, he passed away in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On or about 8 December 2009, the
                    Respondents received a letter from the Borrower signed by Ferry Tanudjaya,
                    Susanto’s brother-in-law, requesting the Respondents’ consent to a
                    proposed sale of shares in various companies and for the PG, including all
                    antecedent breaches and accrued rights thereunder, to be absolutely and
                    unconditionally discharged, waived and released.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Subsequently, following an Order of Court
                    dated 9 April 2010 (as varied by an Order of Court dated 27 May 2010),
                    Tiny was ordered to be substituted as Defendant (now Appellant) to this action
                    in her capacity as representative of Susanto’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defence was filed on 18 June
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Pleaded defences and show cause defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the Defence, the Appellant essentially
                    denied liability under the PG on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The PG is not binding on Susanto. He
                        did not know how to read or understand English when he signed the PG and the
                        terms of the PG were not fully and properly explained to him. Under
                        Indonesian law (Art 24 of the PG), the PG is not enforceable against a
                        person who could not read and understand the terms of the agreement that he
                        had signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        PG is not binding on the Appellant under Indonesian law as the Respondents
                        have failed to fulfil their obligations under the Facility Agreement and
                        instead, varied the Facility Agreement by way of a letter dated
                        5 February 2007 without the consent of the
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Appellant did not provide any particulars
                    in support of the above defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, the Appellant later went on to file
                    eight affidavits in response to the application for summary judgment, comprising
                    six factual affidavits and two expert affidavits (“the show cause
                    affidavits”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In these affidavits, the Appellant alleged
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     Under Indonesian law, the PG ought
                        to have been explained or translated by the Notary Public (“the
                        Notary”) (or a translator) to Susanto, and to Tiny also, before
                        Susanto executed the PG and before Tiny executed the Spousal
                    Consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Susanto
                        had only completed primary school education. He spoke primarily Hokkien and
                        sometimes “pasar bahasa” (<em>ie</em>,
                        informal Bahasa Indonesia). He did not speak or write formal Bahasa
                        Indonesia, only “pasar bahasa”. He was not able to speak, read
                        or write English beyond simple words and phrases like “yes”,
                        “no”, “good morning” and “how are
                        you”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Notary before whom the PG and a Spousal Consent were signed, did not
                        read or explain the terms of the PG to Susanto line by line in either
                        Hokkien or Bahasa Indonesia. Susanto was unaware that the PG created a
                        primary obligation on him in that the Lenders need not first make reasonable
                        attempts to enforce the Facility Agreement against the Borrowers before the
                        PG can be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     The contents of the PG and a Spousal Consent were not read or
                        explained to Tiny prior to her signing them. She did not know the contents
                        and legal effect of these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant’s “full”
                    defence (<em>ie</em>, pleaded defences and show cause
                    defences combined) to the summary judgment claim may therefore be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Defences under Indonesian
                        law:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       procedural defence of the
                            Notary’s failure to explain or translate line by line the PG to
                            Susanto and to Tiny; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       substantive defence of mistake by Susanto in
                            executing the PG and by Tiny in executing the Spousal
                        Consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Defence that the Appellant had been discharged from any and all obligations
                        under the PG because the Respondents failed to fulfil their obligations
                        under the Facility Agreement and because the Respondents unilaterally varied
                        the Facility Agreement without the Appellant’s consent on
                        5 February 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At the appeal before me, however, the
                    Appellant did not rely on the allegation that the PG was not binding because the
                    Respondents had failed to fulfil their obligations under the Facility Agreement
                    or because of a variation of the Facility Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It must also be noted that the allegation that
                    the PG was not read or explained to Tiny or that her Spousal Consent was
                    executed under a mistake was not pleaded in the Defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At the appeal, the issues which came before me
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     Must an allegation raised for the
                        purpose of challenging an application for summary judgment be pleaded in a
                        Defence?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did
                        the Appellant raise any triable issue?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Raising of defences for the purpose of challenging O 14
                applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As mentioned above, the allegation in respect
                    of Tiny was not pleaded in the Defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At the appeal, counsel for the Respondents
                    submitted that it is well established that in the absence of any good reason,
                    the party challenging an O 14, Rules of Court (Cap 322 R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”) application is not entitled to rely on or raise
                    any unpleaded defence. In support of this principle, counsel for the Respondents
                    cited two High Court decisions, namely <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip
                        Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 786
                        (“<em>Lim Leong Huat</em>”) and <em>United States Trading Co Pte Ltd v Ting Boon Aun</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 981 (“<em>United States
                        Trading</em>”). <em>Lim Leong Huat</em>
                    was a decision of mine. I delivered the grounds of decision on 25 January
                    2008 and <em>United States Trading</em> was a decision of
                    Judith Prakash J who delivered her judgment on 30 January 2008. These two
                    cases reversed the previous principle which did not bind the defendant to the
                    four corners of his pleading (see <em>Lin Securities (Pte) v
                        Noone &amp; Co Sdn Bhd</em> [1989] 1 MLJ 321
                        (“<em>Lin Securities</em>”), cited in
                        <em>United States Trading</em> at [24]-[25]). Consequently, the <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler, SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009)
                    (“the <em>Singapore Court Practice
                    2009</em>”) refers to the new principle at para
                14/3/2A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, counsel for the Appellant argued that
                    the principle in <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> and <em>United States Trading</em> did not survive the 2009 case of
                        <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars
                        Palace)</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Poh Soon Kiat”)</em>. The judgment in <em>Poh
                        Soon Kiat</em> was delivered on 8 December 2009. At [15] of that judgment, the Court of Appeal
                    endorsed the previous principle. The Court of Appeal cited <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 2007) (“the <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em>”) at para 14/2/12:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the appellant] is bound by the four corners of his pleadings [only] at
                        the trial of the action, but ... not ... [in] the O. 14 proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The only case cited in support of this principle was the case of
                        <em>Lin Securities</em>, which was no longer applicable
                    in view of <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> and <em>United States Trading</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It seemed that the Court of Appeal’s
                    attention was not drawn to the two cases decided after <em>Lin
                        Securities</em> or the <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em>. However, its decision was not given <em>per
                        incuriam</em> as the two High Court decisions are not binding on the
                    Court of Appeal (see the judgment of Lord Simon of Glaisdale in <em>Miliangos v Frank (Textiles) Ltd</em> [1976] AC 443
                    at 477). The decision of the Court of Appeal was binding on me and so the
                    Appellant was not precluded by its defence from raising the allegation in
                    respect of Tiny. For completeness, I would add that on 3 March 2010, I
                    reiterated my decision in <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> at
                        [21] of my decision in <em>HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd v Elchemi Assets
                        Pte Ltd and another</em> [2010] SGHC 67. At that time, I was
                    not aware of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Poh Soon
                        Kiat</em> on the same issue. In addition, I have also recently learned
                    that the same issue was raised in <em>Rankine Bernadette Adeline
                        v Chenet Finance Limited</em> [2011] SGHC 79. The grounds of
                    decision were delivered by Kan Ting Chiu J on 31 March 2011. Kan J did not
                    have to decide the issue. Nevertheless, he mentioned at [23] thereof that there is a possibility that
                    the Court of Appeal would have dealt with the issue differently if its attention
                    had been drawn to <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> and <em>United States Trading</em> and we would have to wait till the
                    question goes before the Court again to have an answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Appellant establish any triable issue?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     A defendant has the burden of establishing
                    that “there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be
                    tried” (O 14 r 3 Rules of Court). Put in another way, the Appellant had
                    the burden of establishing a triable issue to avoid summary
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Relying on para 14/4/8 of the <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>, counsel for the
                    Appellant submitted that “[i]f foreign law applies to the contract being
                    considered, that alone provides sufficient cause for leave to defend to be
                    granted”. However, <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> at para 14/12/1 reads:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a point of law arises out of a foreign law which applies to the
                        case, the court is <em>reluctant</em> to try the issue
                        on the basis of affidavit evidence, particularly if there is a hint of legal
                        complexity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, in the case of “<em>The Hung Vuong-2</em>” [2000] 2 SLR(R) 11,
                    the Court of Appeal rejected the opinion advanced by the appellant’s
                    Vietnamese legal expert on the basis, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that it was “clearly unsustainable” (at [19]) in the light of the relevant provision
                    of the Vietnamese Maritime Code. Instead, the Court preferred the opinion of the
                    respondent’s legal expert, which was found to be “wholly logical
                    and sensible” at ([18]). At
                        [16] of the judgment, the Court of
                    Appeal held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We recognise that questions of foreign law are questions of fact and where
                        the opinions of experts conflict on such foreign law, the court should as a
                        general rule refrain from making a determination on the basis of affidavit
                        evidence... But it does not follow that in every instance where there is a
                        conflict of opinions, the Singapore courts should always shy away from
                        examining the opinions given. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the points of Indonesian law, the Court was
                    assisted by the affidavit evidence of Mr Erman Rajagukguk
                    (“Mr Raja”) for the Appellant and Mr Wahyuni Bahar
                    (“Mr Bahar”) for the Respondents, who rendered two opinions
                    each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Mr Raja is a Professor of Law at the
                    Fakultas Hukum Universitas Indonesia in Jakarta, Indonesia. He has been a
                    Professor of Law for 13 years and specialises in the Law of Contract, Law of
                    Corporation, Investment Law, Secured Transaction and the Civil Code of
                    Indonesia. He is admitted to practise law in Indonesia. Mr Raja’s
                    opinion was that the PG is invalid under Indonesian law because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     the procedures for notarisation of
                        such a document under Indonesian Law were not complied
                    with;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     the terms and
                        substance of the PG (which was written in English) were not explained to
                        Susanto (who was not able to read, write or converse in English) before
                        Susanto signed the PG; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Spousal Consent signed by Tiny did not constitute
                        informed consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In particular, he relied on Arts 43 and
                    44 of Law No 30 of 2004 in his first opinion. The English translation reads as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According to the Appellant, the Notary did not
                    read, explain or translate the contents of the PG to Susanto in either Hokkien
                    or Bahasa Indonesia, or explain it in such a language that he fully understood
                    the terms and substance of the PG before signing it. According to Mr Raja,
                    the failure to comply with the procedural requirements under Arts 43 and 44
                    rendered the PG invalid and unenforceable. However, as can be seen, Arts 43
                    and 44 do not expressly state the consequence of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In addition to the improper notarisation,
                    Mr Raja said that Susanto did not in fact fully understand the terms of the
                    PG and the representatives of the Sixth Respondent was aware of this because the
                    PG was not translated and read to Susanto in a language of his preference. Under
                    Art 1320 of the Indonesian Civil Code, an agreement must meet four
                    requirements to be valid and one of them was that the consent of the parties
                    must have been present. I will set out Art 1320 later. In
                    Mr Raja’s opinion, a brief explanation of the PG was not sufficient.
                    It contained special terms. For example, there was a special term for the waiver
                    of the right to demand that the Respondents must first make reasonable attempts
                    to enforce the Facility Agreement against the Borrower (which must have failed)
                    before any enforcement of the PG can be done. Such a special term must have been
                    fully explained to Susanto before he signed the PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The third ground of invalidity was that
                    Tiny’s Spousal Consent was not informed consent because the PG was not
                    read and explained to her and she was not asked to read it before she signed
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Mr Raja also opined that the evidence of
                    the Notary was crucial if the dispute was before an Indonesian
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The expert for the Respondents was
                    Mr Bahar. He had been practising law for 20 years, specialising in capital
                    market, financing and other corporate structuring transactions. He had also
                    lectured in two universities, one in Bandung and one in Jakarta for eight and
                    two years respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In his first opinion dated 18 November
                    2010, Mr Bahar did not agree that the PG had to be translated or explained
                    line by line to Susanto. Furthermore, he opined that even if Art 43 (or
                    Art 44) of Law No 30 of 2004 was not complied with, such a non-compliance
                    would not render the PG invalid and unenforceable. Mr Bahar said that Law
                    No 30 of 2004 was to regulate the scope of a Notary’s duties and
                    obligations and not to affect the validity and enforcement of contracts. The
                    latter is governed by the Indonesian Civil Code (“the
                    ICC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Bahar said that the sanction or
                    consequence for non-compliance with, say, Art 44 was set out in Art 84
                    of Law No 30 of 2004. The English translation states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any violation by a notary of provisions in Article 16 paragraph (1) letter
                        i, Article 16 paragraph (1) letter k, Article 41, Article 44, Article 48,
                        Article 49, Article 50, Article 51 or Article 52, which cause the deed to
                        only have power of authentication as a private deed or the deed being null
                        and void, may become a basis to the party suffering the loss to ask for the
                        costs, damages and interest to the notary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Bahar said that Art 44 prescribes
                    the Notary’s duty to record any reading, explanation or translation at the
                    end of the relevant deed which is distinct from the requirement to translate the
                    contents of the deed into a language understood by the party concerned. The
                    sanction mentioned in Art 84 applies to a breach of Art 44 but not
                    Art 43. He implied that any breach was of Art 43 but not
                    Art 44.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     He said that even a breach of Art 44 did
                    not render the deed invalid or unenforceable. What Art 84 did was to state
                    that if a violation of the relevant article results in a deed being null and
                    void, that may be a basis for the party suffering the loss to make a claim
                    against the Notary. Article 84 does not in itself render a deed null and
                    void for failure to comply with Art 44.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As for the ICC, he referred to Arts 1320,
                    1321, 1322 thereof which were translated as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Article 1322</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mistake does not result in the cancellation of an agreement unless
                        that mistake is happened to the nature of the object which forms the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Mr Bahar noted that Susanto had signed
                    the PG before the Notary and two other witnesses. In addition, Mr Bahar
                    also noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     according to an affidavit of Tiny
                        herself, the Notary’s assistant had (at least) briefly explained the
                        nature of the PG to Susanto and to her in Bahasa
                    Indonesia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        present dispute was not that Susanto had failed to understand that he was
                        signing a guarantee but that it was alleged that he had believed that the
                        Respondents had to commence legal proceedings against the Borrower first. On
                        this point, Susanto had allegedly mentioned this belief to an employee of
                        the Borrower, one Kasan Tjokromulia (“Kasan”) (who had
                        allegedly then checked the issue and told Susanto that there was no need for
                        the Respondents to sue the Borrower first);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     Susanto had not said that he did not fully
                        understood the PG when he signed it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_d"></a>(d)     according to an affidavit and a statutory
                        declaration signed for the Respondents, the contents of the PG was explained
                        in Bahasa Indonesia by the Notary to Susanto and Tiny and the PG was
                        negotiated by Susanto’s lawyers who were also present at the time he
                        signed the PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In view of the above and even without taking
                    into account (d) above, Mr Bahar was of the view that a plea of mistake
                    would not be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As for Tiny’s Spousal Consent,
                    Mr Bahar noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tiny had signed the Spousal
                        Consent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     according to an affidavit of Tiny herself, she was informed by the
                        Notary’s assistant that her consent was required for Susanto to sign
                        the document which he had signed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     according to a statutory declaration signed for the
                        Respondents, the PG and the Spousal Consent were explained in Bahasa
                        Indonesia to Susanto and to Tiny by the Notary; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_d"></a>(d)     Tiny had been accompanied by Susanto
                        and their lawyers on 20 November 2006 when she signed the Spousal
                        Consent before a Notary and these lawyers had negotiated the terms of the
                        PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In view of the above and even without taking
                    into account (c) and (d) above, Mr Bahar was of the view that the Spousal
                    Consent was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Raja’s second opinion, in
                    response, was dated 20 December 2010. He maintained that the Notary was
                    obliged to explain or translate the PG in Bahasa Indonesia to
                Susanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     He also maintained that a failure by the
                    Notary to do so would “necessarily mean” that the PG is not valid
                    and is unenforceable pursuant to Art 1320 of the ICC. He relied on
                    Art 84 of Law No 30 of 2004 (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In his opinion, a breach of Art 44
                    “could have the effect” of rendering the PG null and void. In his
                    view, both Arts 43 and 44 of Law No 30 of 2004 had been breached. He was
                    also of the view that “because Art 44 deals with parties’
                    understanding of the contents of the document before providing their consent to
                    execute the document”, a breach of Art 44 would mean that there was
                    no informed consent as required under Art 1320 of the ICC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Raja did not disagree with
                    Mr Bahar’s opinion on Arts 1321 and 1322 of the ICC. However,
                    Mr Raja maintained in [51] of his
                    second opinion that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, it is asserted that [Susanto] could not read, write
                        or speak in English and therefore could not and did not fully understand the
                        terms of the [PG] before he signed the document. For [Susanto] to have the
                        requisite understanding of the [PG] required to execute the [PG] before the
                        Notary, the terms and substance of the [PG] must be translated and read to
                        [Susanto] in a language of his preference until he acknowledges that he
                        fully understands the substance and terms of the [PG]. This was not done in
                        the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mr Raja was of the opinion that Susanto
                    was mistaken as to the “nature of the object which forms the principle of
                    the agreement” pursuant to Art 1322 of the ICC if he was mistaken or
                    unaware of specific terms, for example, that he had waived his right to require
                    that the Plaintiffs must first make reasonable attempts to enforce the Facility
                    Agreement against the Borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     He expressed a similar opinion in respect of
                    Tiny’s Spousal Consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Bahar’s second opinion, in
                    response to Mr Raja’s second opinion, was dated 10 January 2011.
                    Besides reiterating his first opinion, Mr Bahar disagreed that it is
                    sufficient for a party to be mistaken or unaware of the specific terms of a
                    document which impact on that party’s rights. In his opinion, this is an
                    “impossibly low threshold to annul a contract on the ground of
                    mistake” (see para 50 of his second opinion). In support, he
                    referred to an opinion of Professor R Subekti from R Subekti, <em>Hukum Perjanjian (Contract Law)</em>( PT Intermasa, 4th Ed, 1976) at
                    pp 22-23. The English translation reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A mistake occurs in the event a party makes a mistake regarding the
                        principal matters in the agreement or the important nature of the
                        subject-matter of the agreement or regarding the persons with whom the
                        agreement is entered. The mistake must be in such a way that if the person
                        makes no such mistake regarding the matter, then he/she will not give a
                        consent. ... The counterparty must be aware of the mistake or at least ought
                        to have been aware that it was facing persons laboring under the mistake. If
                        the counterparty is not aware of the mistake or could not have been aware
                        that it is facing persons laboring under the mistake, then it is unfair to
                        annul the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Mr Raja also said that it was not
                    asserted or shown that Susanto would not have signed the PG had he been fully
                    apprised of the effect of each of the terms of the PG and there were more than
                    sufficient grounds for the Respondents to believe that Susanto understood the
                    nature and contents of the PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before I continue, I would mention that the
                    Appellant sought to dilute Mr Bahar’s opinions by pointing to a
                    qualification which he included near the end of each of his opinions. The
                    qualification states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My opinion that an obligation or document is enforceable means that the
                        courts of the Republic of Indonesia should enforce such obligation or
                        document. It is not to be taken as meaning that the obligation or document
                        will necessarily be enforced in accordance with its terms in all
                        circumstances. Enforceability in the Republic of Indonesia may be subject to
                        the principles of good faith, fairness, reasonableness, and public policy
                        and the general discretion of such courts of the Republic of Indonesia to
                        apply such principles. The interpretation by the courts of those principles
                        in certain circumstances may limit or preclude the reliance on, or
                        enforcement of, contractual terms and provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In my view, that qualification was a standard
                    one used by Mr Bahar as a matter of caution to avoid any liability in case
                    an Indonesian court should come to a decision contrary to his opinion. It did
                    not suggest a lack of conviction in his own opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Bearing in mind the nature of their
                    application for summary judgment, the Respondents proceeded on the assumption,
                    for the present purpose, that the Notary did not read or explain or translate
                    the PG to Susanto and also did not do so line by line. The evidence of the
                    Notary was therefore not relevant for the present purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I agreed with Mr Bahar that Arts 43
                    and 44 of Law No 30 of 2004 do not cover the same activity. That is evident from
                    a reading of those provisions. Art 43 refers to a Notary’s obligation
                    to translate or explain if a party does not understand the language used in the
                    deed. Article 44 refers to the requirement that the deed shall be signed by
                    the parties and the Notary and the witnesses and the translator but that assumes
                    that there is a translator. Article 44 also states that the reading, translation
                    or explanation shall be stated clearly in writing at the end of the deed. That
                    assumes that there was a translation or explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It seemed to me that there was, at most, a
                    breach of Art 43. Mr Raja had suggested that a breach of Art 43
                    necessarily meant a breach of Art 44 because he knew that Art 84 of
                    Law No 30 of 2004 applied to a breach of Art 44 but not of
                    Art 43.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Even if Art 84 applied to the facts of
                    the present case, I agreed with Mr Bahar that Art 84 does not in
                    itself state that a breach of Art 44 renders the PG invalid or
                    unenforceable. That is clear from the terms of Art 84 itself. All it does
                    is to state that the party suffering the loss may make a claim against the
                    Notary where the deed is rendered void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The consequence of a breach of Art 43 (or
                    Art 44) depends on Arts 1320 to 1322 of the ICC as opined by
                    Mr Bahar. Significantly, Mr Raja did not say that these Articles were
                    irrelevant so long as Art 43 or 44 of Law No 30 of 2004 was breached.
                    Therefore, if a deed was not translated or explained to a guarantor but the
                    facts show that he understood the nature of the object which forms the principal
                    matters of the deed, the deed is not rendered invalid just because of a breach
                    of Art 43 (or 44).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The above accords with commercial common
                    sense. Why should a guarantee be rendered invalid or unenforceable for lack of
                    explanation or translation by a Notary if in fact the guarantor understood the
                    nature of the guarantee without the need for such an explanation or
                    translation?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Indonesian law does not lead to the conclusion
                    advocated by Mr Raja who had assumed that a Notary’s failure to
                    explain or translate to Susanto in a language or dialect he understood
                    necessarily meant that Susanto did not understand the nature of the PG or was
                    unaware or mistaken about a specific term therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Appellant’s allegation about
                    Susanto’s unawareness was in respect of a term that the Respondents did
                    not have to proceed first against the Borrower before taking action against
                    Susanto. This allegation arose from what Kasan had said (see [49(b)]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Daniel,
                    submitted that if Susanto was under the impression that the Respondents had to
                    proceed first against the Borrower, that was a mistake as to the nature of his
                    obligation, <em>ie</em>, he had thought his obligation was
                    secondary to that of the Borrower and not a primary obligation to the
                    Respondents. This was a sufficient mistake to render the PG invalid and
                    unenforceable; it was at the least a triable issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I was of the view that even if such a mistake
                    could arguably render the PG invalid and unenforceable, the allegation about
                    that mistake was a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the first place, the Defence did not allude
                    to such a mistake. Instead, it suggested that Susanto did not even know he was
                    signing a guarantee (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     If I was not bound by the decision in
                        <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em>, I would have decided that it
                    was not open to the Appellant to raise the allegation that Susanto was unaware
                    of his primary obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In any event, the failure by the Appellant to
                    specifically raise Susanto’s unawareness of his primary obligation in the
                    Defence suggested a sham.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Secondly, if the allegation was true, Susanto
                    would have raised it to the Respondents at the earliest opportunity after he
                    received the letters of demand and after Kasan had allegedly checked and told
                    him that it was not necessary for the Respondents to commence legal proceedings
                    against the Borrower first (see [49(b)] above). Yet, there was nary a protest by
                    Susanto to the Respondents when he was alive. No explanation was given for this
                    omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Thirdly, as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, on or about 8 December 2009, the
                    Respondents received a letter from the Borrower signed by Ferry Tanudjaya,
                    Susanto’s brother-in-law. That letter requested the Respondents’
                    consent to a proposed sale of shares in various companies and for the PG to be
                    discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     No explanation was given by the Appellant as
                    to why this letter was sent without mentioning that Susanto was unaware of his
                    primary obligation under the PG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Fourthly, Susanto was an experienced
                    businessman. He must have been familiar with or at least aware of facilities
                    like those under the Facility Agreement and the terms thereof and the
                    requirement of a guarantee including the primary obligation provision. Indeed,
                    he had signed a guarantee previously dated 17 October 2005 (also in the
                    English language) which the Respondents said effectively had a similar provision
                    as that found in the PG which allowed action to be taken against him without
                    having to take action against the Borrower first. This also contradicted
                    Kasan’s affidavit of 4 October 2010 when he said that as far as he
                    knew, the PG (before me) was the first one that Susanto had signed in the
                    English language. Likewise, Tiny must have been aware that her husband’s
                    business required funding and that he might have to give a personal guarantee
                    for which her consent was required. She too had signed a similar spousal consent
                    for the previous guarantee dated 17 October 2005. There was no suggestion
                    that the terms of the PG were unusual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Fifthly, the Borrower was advised by both
                    foreign and Indonesian lawyers, <em>ie</em>, Milbank,
                    Tweek, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP (“Milbank”) and Indrawan, Heisky
                    &amp; Partners (“IHP”). The terms of the Facility Agreement were
                    negotiated over some months. Comments were also given by Milbank and/or IHP on
                    the terms of the PG. While Mr Daniel sought to argue that the lawyers were
                    not engaged by Susanto, this was based on the technical point that the invoice
                    of the lawyers were not sent to or paid by Susanto personally. It was clear to
                    me that they were nevertheless looking after Susanto’s personal interest
                    also, as well as Tiny’s interest I might add. This was not a case of their
                    interests being overlooked or their being hung out to dry. It was also not in
                    dispute that lawyers from IHP accompanied Susanto and Tiny on the day the PG and
                    Spousal Consent were signed in the presence of the Notary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     According to Kasan’s affidavit of
                    16 December 2010, Milbank did not explain or translate any of the
                    transaction documents including the PG to Susanto. Neither did IHP. IHP was not
                    requested to explain any of the transaction documents including the PG to
                    Susanto and therefore did not do so. This begged the question as to why no one
                    asked IHP to do so and why an experienced businessman like Susanto was
                    nevertheless willing to sign the PG. He must have been familiar with his
                    obligations thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As for the Spousal Consent, Tiny stated at
                    paras 6 to 9 of her second affidavit affirmed on 5 October
                    2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    When it came to my turn to sign the Spousal Consent,
                            I was informed by the Notary Public’s assistant that my consent
                            was required for my late husband to sign the documents that he had
                            signed. However, none of those documents were read or explained to me at
                            all by the Notary Public or his assistant. I was also not asked to read
                            any of the documents by myself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    I can read, speak and understand some English, but
                            my abilities in this regard are limited, and I require someone to read
                            out the document to me and explain slowly and carefully. For instance,
                            when my previous affidavit in this action was signed and when I signed
                            this affidavit, my solicitors, along with my late husband’s
                            colleagues, slowly and carefully explained the contents to me, ensured
                            that I understood, and only then did I sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    I never knew the contents and legal effects of the
                            documents that I had signed at the Notary’s office because none of
                            those documents were read or explained to me at all by the Notary Public
                            or his assistant. I was also not asked to read any of the documents by
                            myself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    Consequently, while I may have signed the Spousal
                            Consent, it was not informed consent as no one read or explained any of
                            the documents to me at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Yet, when I asked Mr Daniel what Tiny was
                    not able to understand specifically, he accepted that she had not addressed this
                    point. Her position seemed to be that there was no informed consent on her part
                    just because no one read or explained any document to her at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Bearing in mind that she did not explain what
                    she did not understand specifically, the fact that the allegation in respect of
                    the Spousal Consent was raised so late in the day (<em>ie</em>, in her second affidavit of 5 October 2010 for the first
                    time) and the points mentioned in <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above, I concluded that this was a
                    sham allegation as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the circumstances, I did not think that
                    there was a triable issue and I dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
