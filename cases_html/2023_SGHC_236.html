The reduced access to capital had a cascading effect on the entire commodity trading industry, including the LMA Group. In particular, the LMA Group’s overall business and operations were affected as the LMA Group faced difficulties with funding committed trades by advance payment and/or the LMA Group’s cash.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on SUM 2439</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The principles governing this application are clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Section 64(1) of the IRDA enables a company which intends to propose a scheme of arrangement to apply to court to restrain proceedings against it. In <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> All Measure Technology (S) Pte Ltd (RHB Bank Bhd, non‑party) </span>[2023] SGHC 148 (at [8]–[10]), it was held that cases which interpreted s 211B(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which is the predecessor provision to s 64(1) of the IRDA, continue to be applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> IM Skaugen SE and other matters </span>[2019] 3 SLR 979 (“<span class="font-italic">IM Skaugen</span>”) at [57], the court held that in determining whether such an application should be granted, “the court undertakes a balancing exercise between allowing the applicant the requisite breathing space and ensuring that the interests of creditors are sufficiently safeguarded”. In that regard, the court does not at this stage delve into a detailed assessment of the reasonable prospect of the proposed scheme working, but only undertakes a broad-based assessment: <span class="font-italic">Re Babel Holding Ltd and other matters </span>[2023] SGHC 98 at [17]. As observed by the court in <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">M Skaugen </span>at [57], it is not uncommon that the restructuring efforts of a company applying for a moratorium “are nascent or certainly not at a level of maturity to be placed before a duly called scheme meeting”. That observation equally applies where the applicant is seeking an extension of a moratorium, although such an application should in addition be supported with sufficient detail on what the applicant has done so far, how much longer it anticipates it will need and what it reasonably believes it can accomplish in the extended period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This application for a further extension to 15 September 2023 failed to deal with the concerns I had earlier expressed in allowing the first extension. The Company still did not offer any plan which allowed even a broad-based assessment as to its viability or its benefit for the creditors. In fact, it appeared that its restructuring plans had stalled, or had failed to progress meaningfully, and the Company had no solution to advance the same. I make the following observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 First, SUM 2439 was filed on 8 August 2023 <span class="font-italic">after</span> the moratorium had expired on 31 July 2023, and was therefore out of time – see s 64(7) of IRDA. While s 13 of IRDA allowed me to grant the Company an extension of time, it is trite that an extension should only be granted if good grounds are shown. In Mr Chow’s 7th Affidavit filed in support of SUM 2439 (“Chow’s 7th Affidavit”), he states the Company was unable to apply for the extension of the moratorium before 31 July 2023 because “[he] was still in the midst of obtaining updates from the Founders Team on the progress of the restructuring efforts, and therefore the developments on this front were still unclear to (him) at that point. [He] also [understood] from the Founders Team that they were still working on progressing the restructuring efforts, which culminated in the email to Horizon on 4 August 2023, as set out above”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This did not adequately explain why the application could not be filed before 31 July 2023. The email to Horizon on 4 August 2023 did not evidence any specific milestone achieved or progress in the restructuring, other than vague expressions of optimism of a deal. There was also no explanation as to whether anything had changed between 31 July 2023 and 4 August 2023 (or even 8 August 2023) to justify or explain why an application to extend the moratorium could only reasonably have been made after the deadline had passed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Second, it appeared from Chow’s 7th Affidavit that Mr Chow was not involved in, much less leading, the restructuring efforts. All he appeared to be doing was to relay information about those efforts which he was receiving from the “Founders Team”. The Company’s counsel confirmed that Mr Chow was “marginally involved” in the restructuring efforts.

</div> The language employed in Mr Chow’s affidavits demonstrated that he was reliant on the Founders to update him on the negotiations in respect of the New Business, and that he was not in a position to confirm the accuracy of those updates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In any event, the issue of an extension of time to file SUM 2439 was moot as I was not prepared to grant a further extension of the moratorium. I had indicated at the previous hearing that an application for a further extension would not be looked on favourably unless there was significant progress in the restructuring efforts. There was clearly none.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 First, there was no indication as to when a s 210(1) CA application would likely be made. The earlier estimate of end June 2023 (see [17] above) had long passed, and no new estimated date had been offered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Second, with respect to the Horizon MOU, Mr Chow’s evidence was that progress had been delayed on account of “regulatory issues in Japan and constantly evolving market conditions” which led to the Company encountering “some commercial difficulties with the shipowners and the contracts in relation to the Horizon MOU have therefore still not been signed as at the date of this affidavit”.

</div> Crucially, the Company did not say it had an alternative to advance the proposed business in the event that the issues could not be resolved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, there were no material developments with respect to the Varamar MOU. Horizon had still not executed it or stated that it would do so. It remained, at best, only a broad proposal. The Company said it was exploring ways to eliminate Horizon’s participation in the venture, but no details were offered. There was also no evidence that the parties to the Varamar MOU were able or prepared to proceed without Horizon’s support. The best Mr Chow could say was that the Founders were “continuing to work on getting [Horizon] to agree to the Varamar MOU”.

</div>
</div> In this regard, it is significant that Horizon’s support for the Company had waned – it took no position on this application for an extension of the moratorium, a change from its active support in February 2023 – see [12(c)] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Fourth, only one vessel was identified to “plug into the framework under the Varamar MOU”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-5d72dab4-658f-46f7-87e0-3b5dd0fefaf8" data-toggle="modal" type="button">46</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> But the terms for the financing for this vessel had not even been agreed. Further, neither the Varamar MOU nor Chow’s 7th Affidavit stated how many vessels would be necessary to make the venture viable – as observed above at [18], the Varamar MOU was lacking in detail. It was therefore not known whether this one vessel, even if secured, would make a significant impact at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Fifth, the Company made vague assertions about raising financing in respect of the Varamar MOU. It was stated in Chow’s 7th Affidavit that he understood “that the Founders Team have approached a broker to conduct an equity raise for the purposes of the ship acquisitions contemplated under the Varamar MOU”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-c2f207f4-5e5a-42ab-97f9-30cf5122cd62" data-toggle="modal" type="button">47</button></sup>

</div> This was plainly insufficient to give assurance that there was a reasonable prospect that the business would be viable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Sixth, as stated above at [18], no projections were offered as to the profits to be generated from the Varamar MOU, or how those profits would be distributed to benefit the Company. All that was stated was that 40% of the profits would be allocated to Horizon and 60% would be divided between Varamar and AVIV.

</div>
</div> No details were given of that division, or the amount which would then flow to the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Seventh, even though the question had been raised when OA 29 was first heard on 10 February 2023, it had still not been explained <span class="font-italic">how </span>the profits from the New Business would be made available to the Company. Indeed, the Varamar MOU, unlike the Horizon MOU, did not even state that the profits generated in respect of that venture would be paid to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I stress that most of the above is not even an analysis of the Proposed Scheme, but the viability of the New Business which the Proposed Scheme (when presented) will be entirely dependent on. Despite Mr Chow having been appointed about a year ago to restructure the Company, it remained uncertain how or when that restructuring would be achieved. The lack of any meaningful progress thus far was telling. As things stood, the New Business envisaged in the Horizon MOU and the Varamar MOU appeared dead in the water.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Finally, there was no explanation as to why the Company was seeking an extension of the moratorium to 15 September 2023. That was only about three weeks from 22 August 2023, when this application was heard. The Company’s counsel candidly informed me that he was not aware of anything that was planned or likely to happen before 15 September 2023. Chow’s 7th Affidavit also did not deal with the issue. The date appeared arbitrary and seemed, at best, an attempt to kick the can down the road.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 There was also no progress in respect of the Company’s draft financial statements. As noted above at [19(c)], the financial statements for: (a) 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2021, and (b) 1 January 2022 to 31 August 2022, had been prepared on a “best efforts basis”, and were therefore of limited value. This was even though the Company had been permitted through a validation application to hire finance staff to prepare its accounts. It appeared that Mr Chow was unable to certify the accuracy of the draft financial statements because of missing documents and information. As the Company’s counsel informed me, this was the situation Mr Chow “inherited”. But the Company was not an insubstantial entity – as at the financial year ended 30 September 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries generated a revenue of over US$1.6bn.

</div> It was therefore surprising that it was unable to produce reliable financial statements. No affidavit was filed by the Founders to explain the state of the Company’s documentation.
