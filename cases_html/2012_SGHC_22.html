<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This Registrar’s Appeal No 94 of 2011
                    (“RA 94”) was from the decision of the Assistant Registrar
                    refusing to stay an admiralty action between foreigners arising from a collision
                    between foreign vessels of different nationalities in the Straits of
                    Malacca.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">In Rem Proceedings: A Chronology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s vessel, the <em>Capt Stefanos</em>, was in collision with the
                    defendant’s vessel, the <em>Reecon Wolf</em>, on
                        21<sup>st</sup> August 2010 at 1748 hours in the Straits of
                    Malacca. The defendant commenced an <em>in rem</em> action
                    in the High Court of Malaya at Malacca and arrested the plaintiff’s
                    vessel, the <em>Capt Stefanos</em>, on 24 August 2010.
                    The plaintiff secured her release by providing security in the form of a letter
                    of undertaking furnished by North of England P&amp;I Club Association Ltd. The
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> was released from arrest in
                    Malacca on 30 August 2010. For ease of reference, the short title of the
                    defendant’s <em>in rem</em> action against the
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> is Admiralty in Rem
                    No. 27-1-2010 (“the Malaysian Action”),</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff wishing to found jurisdiction in
                    Singapore arrested the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> whilst she was
                    here. Admiralty in Rem No 157 of 2010 was commenced on 26 August 2010
                    (“the Singapore Action”). On the same day, the <em>in rem</em> writ was served and the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> was arrested in Singapore. The defendant secured her release
                    by providing security in the form of a letter of undertaking furnished by Gard
                    P&amp;I (Bermuda) Ltd. The R<em>eecon Wolf</em> was
                    released from arrest on 28 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The claim in the Singapore Action is a maritime
                    claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore.
                    Likewise, the claim against the <em>Capt Stefanos</em> in
                    Malacca (the Malaysian Action) is a maritime claim within the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the High Court of Malaya, at Malacca. Notably, the parties would
                    be the same even if, procedurally, their positions were reversed in the two
                    actions so that the present plaintiff in the Singapore Action was the defendant
                    in the Malaysian Action, and <em>vice versa</em>. The
                    substantive issues in both proceedings were the same, namely, which vessel was
                    responsible for the collision? If both vessels were negligent, what should the
                    apportionment of liability be? Simply put, each party would be liable for the
                    damage in proportion to the degree in which its ship was at fault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant filed its Preliminary Act in the
                    Malaysian Action on 8 September 2010. The plaintiff filed its Preliminary
                    Act in the Singapore Action on 26 October 2010. On the same date, the
                    plaintiff applied to stay the Malaysian Action in favour of Singapore
                    (“the Malaysian Stay Application”), and on 3 November 2010,
                    the defendant followed suit and applied, <em>vide</em>
                    Summons No 5218 of 2010 (“SUM No 5218”), for an order that the
                    Singapore Action be stayed in favour of Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       SUM No 5218 was dismissed by the Assistant
                    Registrar on 18 March 2011. The defendant duly filed RA 94 on 31 March
                    2011. On 8 July 2011, I allowed the appeal in RA 94 and ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, a stay of the Singapore Action and directed
                    that security be furnished by the defendant to secure the plaintiff’s
                    intended claims in Malaysia. The plaintiff has appealed against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I should mention that even though the Malaysian
                    Stay Application was filed earlier, SUM No 5218 was coincidentally heard first
                    on 18 March 2011. In the course of the hearing of RA 94, counsel for the
                    plaintiff, Mr John Seow (“Mr Seow”), informed me of the
                    dismissal of the Malaysian Stay Application, and that an appeal would be lodged
                    on 6 July 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When deciding on this appeal, I had to bear in
                    mind the latest development: that the High Court of Malaya at Malacca had ruled
                    on the appropriateness of Malaysia as the forum for the resolution of the issues
                    between the parties; that the Malaysian Action would go on whatever might happen
                    in Singapore; and that the plaintiff would appeal against the
                ruling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events leading to and after the collision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The <em>Capt Stefanos</em>
                    is a Bahamian registered vessel and the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> is registered in the Marshall Islands. The owner of the
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> is Osmium Shipping Corporation,
                    a Liberian company, and the vessel appears to be managed and operated by
                    entities based in Greece or the Bahamas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The owner of the
                        <em>Reecon Wolf</em> is Daimon Shipping Ltd, a company
                    incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Its shipmanagers, Furtrans Ship Management
                    GmbH, have their headquarters in Germany but operate from Turkey. The officers
                    and crew members of the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> were from the
                    People’s Republic of China. The Master and Second Mate of the <em>Capt Stefanos</em> were Greek whilst the Chief Mate was
                    Ukrainian. Her crew members were mainly Filipinos with the exception of an AB
                    (able-bodied seaman) who was a citizen of the People’s Republic of
                    China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Both vessels laden with cargo were bound for
                    China and were transiting the Straits of Malacca <em>en
                        </em><em>route</em> to Singapore for bunkers when
                    the collision occurred. Prior to the collision, the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> was seen overtaking on the port side of the <em>Capt Stefanos.</em> Shortly after she reached a position just
                    forward of the port beam of the <em>Capt Stefanos</em>, the
                        <em>Reecon Wolf</em> suddenly veered to starboard. The
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> immediately put her wheel
                    hard-to-starboard to turn away from the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em>. However, the starboard bow of the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> collided with the aft port quarter of the <em>Capt Stefanos</em>. Both vessels sustained collision damage from the
                    incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After the collision, the Masters of the
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> and the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> communicated over VHF. From the VHF communication,
                    it appears that the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> experienced power
                    loss and steering gear failure shortly before the collision. This VHF
                    communication after the collision was not disputed by either party. The
                    plaintiff has therefore alleged that the collision happened when the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> experienced a loss of engine power whilst
                    attempting to overtake the <em>Capt
                Stefanos</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Malaysian Marine Department
                    (“MMD”) intervened shortly after the incident and directed the
                    vessels to anchor at the port of Malacca for investigations. The crew of both
                    vessels were interviewed and some documentation onboard the vessels were
                    provided to the MMD officers. Nothing further appeared to have ensued since the
                    vessels left Malacca.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Whilst the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> was under arrest in Singapore, the plaintiff filed Summons
                    No 4061 of 2010 for the inspection of the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> pursuant to O 70 r 28 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). An Inspection Order was granted and the
                    plaintiff’s appointed experts, who were from the firm of BMT Marine &amp;
                    Offshore Surveys (“BMT Singapore”), inspected and conducted tests
                    on the steering gear and equipment onboard the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> for over two days on 27 and 28 August 2010. It appears
                    that the defendant had given an undertaking to preserve all relevant documents
                    in its custody, possession and power pending the determination of the dispute
                    either in Singapore or Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There was little dispute as to the principles
                    the court must apply when considering an application to stay proceedings on
                    grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> The principles
                    are enunciated in the <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v
                        Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460 (“<em>The </em><em>Spiliada</em>”). <em>The </em><em>Spiliada</em> has been
                    approved and followed by the Court of Appeal in Singapore and the most recent
                    decisions are: <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and Another v Nicolai
                        Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377
                        (“<em>Rickshaw Investments</em>”),
                        <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 543 and <em>JIO Minerals FZC and others v
                        Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 391
                        (“<em>JIO Minerals</em>”). It is settled
                    law that the court has a general discretion applying <em>The
                        </em><em>Spiliada</em> principles to stay
                    proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    when this is required in the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     
          <em>The </em>
<em>Spiliada</em> principles encompass a 2-stage process. Stage 1
                    involves identifying the existence of an available forum that is clearly or
                    distinctly more appropriate than Singapore for the action to be tried in,
                        <em>ie</em>, the forum in which the case may be tried
                    more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. At
                    Stage 1, the burden is on the defendant to show <em>both</em> that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum for
                    the trial of the action, and that there is another available forum which is
                    clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (see <em>The Spilidia</em> (at 477) and <em>JIO
                        Minerals</em> (at [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The natural or appropriate forum for the trial
                    of the action is the forum with which the action has the most real and
                    substantial connection, and it is identified by its connections to various
                    factors. The list of factors is not exhaustive. The usual factors taken into
                    consideration are the residence and place of business of the parties, matters
                    affecting the convenience and expense of the parties of litigating in either of
                    the competing fora (such as the location and availability of witnesses), and the
                    law applicable to the substance of the dispute. The place where the tort is
                    committed is <em>prima facie</em> the natural forum in the
                    sense that it is the forum that is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate
                    forum for the action to be tried in. However, as this is only a <em>prima facie</em> position, the court will consider if the
                        <em>prima facie</em> natural forum is either displaced
                    by other factors or, if taken with other factors, they all clearly point to the
                    natural forum as the more appropriate forum (see <em>JIO
                        Minerals</em> at [106]; <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan
                        Fatt Cheung and others</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1192
                        (“<em>Chan Chin Cheung</em>”) at
                        [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Multiplicity of proceedings is also a relevant
                    factor in evaluating the more appropriate forum (see <em>Meadows
                        Indemnity Co Ltd v Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd</em> [1989] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 181 at 189 (the Court of Appeal refused to interfere in the
                    judge’s exercise of discretion, see [1989] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 298);
                        <em>The Varna </em><em>No 2</em>
                    [1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 41 at 47; <em>Chan Chin
                        Cheung</em> at [44]). In cases
                    of <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, considerations for a stay of
                    one set of proceedings are the undesirability of the same issues between the
                    same parties being litigated concurrently in two jurisdictions, and the risk of
                    conflicting decisions emanating from the two proceedings. The development of
                    this aspect of <em>The Spilidia</em> considerations in a
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> setting is helpfully
                    summarised in Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on <em>The Conflict of
                        Laws</em>,Vol 1 <em>(</em>Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        14<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) at para 12-036:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although it was once thought that there were special factors in cases of
                            <em>lis alibi pendens</em>, it is now clear that
                        the existence of simultaneous proceedings is no more than a factor relevant
                        to the determination of the appropriate forum. In <em>The
                            Abidin Daver</em>, Lord Diplock said that, where proceedings were
                        pending in a foreign court between the parties, and the defendant in the
                        foreign proceedings commenced proceedings as plaintiff in England, then the
                        additional inconvenience or expense which must result from allowing two sets
                        of legal proceedings to be pursued concurrently in two different
                        jurisdictions, where the same facts would be in issue and the testimony of
                        the same witnesses required, could only be justified if the would-be
                        plaintiff in England could establish objectively by cogent evidence that
                        there was some personal or juridical advantage that would be available to
                        him only in the English action and which was of such importance that it
                        would cause injustice to deprive him of it. This was an application of his
                        formula in <em>MacShannon v Rockware Glass Ltd</em> to
                        cases of <em>lis alibi pendens</em>. It was confirmed
                        that the principles enunciated in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp
                            v Cansulex Ltd</em> apply whether or not there are other
                        proceedings already pending in the alternative forum: the foreign
                        proceedings may be of no relevance at all, for example, if one party has
                        commenced them for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competing
                        jurisdiction, or if the proceedings have not passed beyond the stage of
                        initiating process. But if genuine proceedings have been started and have
                        had some impact on the dispute between the parties, especially if it is
                        likely to have a continuing effect, then this may be a relevant (but not
                        necessarily decisive) factor when considering whether the foreign
                        jurisdiction provides the appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Put simply, the two sets of proceedings are merely one of the
                    circumstances to be considered by this court (see also Lord Goff in <em>De Dampierre v De Dampierre</em> [1988] AC 92 at
                    108). Hence, the nature and existence of multiple or concurrent proceedings and
                    the weight to be given to this factor will depend on all the circumstances of
                    the case, including the state of advance of the other foreign action,
                    consequences of ongoing proceedings in terms of inconvenience, expenses, and
                    other matters such as risk of conflicting judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     If the court concludes that <em>prima facie</em> there is a clearly or distinctly more appropriate
                    forum, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason
                    of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted. At
                    Stage 2, all the circumstances of the case will be considered. The burden of
                    proof at Stage 2 is on the plaintiff. On the evidential standard of proof, I
                    note that Lord Diplock in <em>The Abidin Daver</em> [1984]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 339 at 344 required the plaintiff to establish
                    “objectively by cogent evidence” that there is some personal or
                    juridical advantage available to the plaintiff in the Singapore proceedings, and
                    that it is of such importance that it would cause injustice to the plaintiff to
                    deprive the plaintiff of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     
          <em>The Spiliada</em>
                    principles and the court’s discretion are not affected by the fact that
                    proceedings are <em>in rem.</em> Therefore, even though the
                    plaintiff has founded jurisdiction as of right, there is no presumption or extra
                    weight in the balance in favour of the plaintiff; the approach is the
                    “more appropriate forum” test. As D.C. Jackson observed in
                        <em>Enforcement of Maritime Claims</em> (LLP London,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2005) at para 12.99:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The burden of proof on the defendant takes into account, without
                        emphasising, the establishment of jurisdiction in this country by the
                        claimant, particularly where the basis of the jurisdiction is relatively a
                        slight connection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I make one additional observation. The
                        <em>in rem</em> nature of the suit confirms the
                    existence of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute and the
                    provision of adequate security for the maritime claim in one jurisdiction
                        (<em>ie</em>, Singapore). In the present case, the
                    plaintiff’s maritime lien attaching at the moment of collision was a right
                    against the particular ship and, the arrest in Singapore was a proper course to
                    pursue. At the other end of the balance in a <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> analysis is the concern for finding an alternative
                    forum in terms of both availability of jurisdiction and adequate security. To
                    overcome any personal or juridical advantage derived from the <em>in rem</em> factor as described, the defendant is usually prepared,
                    as was the case here, to submit to the jurisdiction of the alternative forum and
                    to post adequate security there. In doing so, the court when addressing the
                    issue of stay can with ease embark upon a consideration of whether or not the
                    alternative forum (<em>ie</em>, Malaysia) is a more
                    appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally, the manifest concern for
                    international comity in <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    principles. The Singapore courts have acknowledged the importance of
                    international comity, and in a proper case have given the doctrine due regard.
                    In <em>Q&amp;M Enterprises Sdn Bhd </em><em>v Poh </em><em>Kiat</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Q&amp;M
                        Enterprises</em>”), Andrew Phang JC said (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[C]omity is to be observed in deed, and not merely in word.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In giving regard to both international comity
                    and convenience, Phang JC stated (at [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">..[w]here there is a direct clash between international comity on the one
                        hand and mere inconvenience to one of the parties on the other, the former
                        must surely prevail...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, if giving accord to international comity offends the public
                    policy of the domestic legal system (for example, Singapore), naturally the
                    interest of the latter will prevail (per Phang JC at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     “Comity” is defined in <em>Morguard Investments Ltd v De Savoye</em> [1990] 3 SCR 1077
                    at p 1096 (and subsequently approved in <em>Amchem Products
                        Incorporated v British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation
                        Board)</em> [1993] 1 SCR 897) (“<em>Amchem
                        Products</em>”) in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Comity” in the legal sense is neither a matter of absolute
                        obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the
                        other. But it is the recognition which one nation allows within its
                        territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation,
                        having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the
                        rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection
                        of its laws...”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Multiplicity of proceedings here and abroad in
                    respect of the same controversy and parties is a concern. The possibility of
                    friction caused by conflicting decisions from different jurisdictions has found
                    expression in judicial acknowledgment of the concept of comity, and in the
                    judicial exercise of discretionary powers. This brings me to <em>The Abidin Daver</em>. In that case, there were concurrent
                    proceedings in England and Turkey and the court had to decide whether to stay
                    the English proceedings. Lord Diplock was concerned that if concurrent
                    proceedings were allowed to continue in England and Turkey, there might well be
                    “an unseemly race to be the first to obtain judgment”, and opined
                    that “comity demands that such a situation should not be permitted to
                    occur as between court of two civilised and friendly states” (at 344). In
                    short, the risk of inconsistent judgments can be avoided if one court gives way
                    to the other in the interest of international comity. A similar risk of
                    inconsistent findings and conflicting decisions also arises where there are two
                    related or parallel actions, one here and abroad and the court is asked to stay
                    one of the actions. To illustrate, in <em>Chan Chin
                        Cheung</em>, there were parallel proceedings in Singapore and Malaysia
                    and the Singapore proceedings were stayed in the interest of international
                    comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No Agreement on jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The issue of an agreement on jurisdiction that
                    the Assistant Registrar took time to consider was not pursued at this appeal.
                    For completeness, a brief recount of Mr Seow’s clarification of the
                    matter (and without deciding on the correctness of his explanation) is as
                    follows. It was not the plaintiff’s case that there was in existence an
                    agreement on jurisdiction to resolve disputes arising from the collision.
                    Mr Ioannis Botonakis (“Mr Botonakis”), the manager of
                    the plaintiff’s vessel, did not make any assertion of an agreement on
                    jurisdiction. It was the defendant who had misunderstood his affidavit evidence
                    which made reference to an agreement to confer in Singapore on matters such as
                    jurisdiction to resolve liability for the collision, and security for the
                    collision claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the defendant, Mr S Mohan
                    (“Mr Mohan”) explained that the parties and the subject
                    matter of the Singapore Action have no connections with Singapore. In those
                    circumstances, it was argued, that this court, in its discretion, should stay
                    the Singapore Action so as to allow the matters in issue between the parties to
                    be dealt with in the Malaysian Action which involved the same parties and the
                    same cause of action as the Singapore Action. Compared to Singapore, Malaysia
                    was clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum having competent jurisdiction
                    for the just resolution of the dispute for several reasons. Malaysia was the
                    natural, or at any rate, a natural forum for the resolution of the collision
                    damage between the parties. He emphasised that the collision occurred in
                    Malaysian territorial waters and that arising out of the collision the defendant
                    had commenced <em>in rem</em> proceedings against the
                        <em>Capt Stefanos</em> and arrested her in Malacca. The
                    governing law of the tort was Malaysian law. Furthermore, Mr Mohan
                    confirmed that if the plaintiff sued in Malaysia on the same collision, the
                    defendant would submit to the jurisdiction as well as furnish security for the
                    plaintiff’s claims. In addition, the defendant would agree to the use of
                    documents and evidence obtained pursuant to the Inspection Order made against
                    the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> in the Singapore Action. I noted
                    that such promises in the nature of undertakings given in support of the
                    defendant’s application for a stay are permissible, appropriate and
                    effective (see <em>The Lanka Athula</em> [1991] 1 HKC 101;
                        <em>The Polessk</em> [1996] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 40 at
                    51-52 on inspection of vessel by an undertaking or to be imposed on the grant of
                    stay).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Mohan identified eight factors which,
                    as it appeared to him, pointed to Malaysia as clearly or distinctly the more
                    appropriate forum for the trial of the plaintiff’s claims against the
                    defendant. They may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The collision occurred in Malaysian
                        territorial waters and the tort occurred in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The governing law of the tort was
                        Malaysian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     After the collision, both vessels were surveyed in Malaysia by surveyors
                        based in Malaysia. The damage surveys were for the speed and angle of blow
                        reports and were, hence, relevant to the liability issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     The investigations by MMD. After the
                        collision both vessels were ordered by MMD to anchor in Malaysian waters.
                        The crew of both vessels were interviewed by MMD officers who also obtained
                        copies of some documents onboard the vessels. The contemporaneous statements
                        of the crew of both vessels on the circumstances leading up to the collision
                        as well as MMD’s investigation report would be relevant. MMD officers
                        could be compelled to testify by subpoena in Malaysia under the Malaysian
                        Rules of the High Court 1980.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     The VHF exchange between the Masters of the vessels
                        shortly after the collision was recorded on the <em>Reecon
                            Wolf’s</em> Voyage Data Recorder (“VDR”). The
                            <em>Reecon Wolf’s</em> VDR data was
                        downloaded from the vessel in Malaysia by Racom Electronics (M) Sdn Bhd
                        (“Racom”) who is the VDR manufacturer’s representative
                        in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_f"></a>(f)     Malaysian VTIS (<em>ie</em>, Vessel Traffic
                        Information System) would have tracked the vessels’ movements. Hence,
                        radar data from a shore based VTIS station would contain useful information
                        to aid reconstruction of the collision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_g"></a>(g)     Temporary collision damage repairs were done in
                        Malaysia. Temporary repairs were carried out by the crew of the <em>Reecon Wolf</em>, and in the case of the <em>Capt Stefanos</em>, temporary repairs in Malaysia were
                        carried out under the supervision of Greek technicians flown in for the
                        assignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_h"></a>(h)     The
                        existence of concurrent proceedings in Malaysia and Singapore in respect of
                        the same collision and between the same parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Building on the eight factors, Mr Mohan
                    went on to argue that the arrest of the <em>Reecon
                        Wolf</em> in Singapore and evidence gathered from the inspection and
                    test of the equipment onboard the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> in
                    Singapore pursuant to an Inspection Order granted by the Singapore court were
                    not weighty factors to suggest that Singapore was the more appropriate forum. In
                    fact, the lack of substantial connections with Singapore supported the
                    defendant’s assertion that the plaintiff was forum shopping in Singapore
                    in order to take advantage of higher limits of liability under Singapore
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Seow rejected the defendant’s
                    contention that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum based on the eight
                    factors mentioned. He claimed that the plaintiff had invoked the Admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore as of right and the
                    plaintiff’s right should not be lightly disturbed. He submitted that
                    Malaysia was not the natural forum for this dispute based solely on the fact
                    that the collision occurred in Malaysian territorial waters, and that this court
                    should not exercise its discretion to stay the Singapore Action so that the
                    dispute could be transferred to Malaysia. His point was that in most collision
                    cases, the place of collision was fortuitous and this fact (<em>ie</em>, the place of collision) standing by itself was too tenuous
                    and not a sufficient reason for staying the Singapore Action. Quite apart from
                    the place of the tort, this court would have to examine whether there were other
                    real and substantial connections to Malaysia. In support of his argument,
                    Mr Seow cited <em>The Peng Yan</em> [2009] 1 HKLRD 144
                        (“<em>The Peng Yan</em>”) at [28], a decision of the Hong Kong Court of
                    Appeal (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Seow identified various connecting
                    factors to Singapore. They may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Singapore Action was commenced
                        as of right.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The <em>Reecon Wolf</em> was inspected in Singapore
                        pursuant to an Inspection Order and the plaintiff’s expert, William
                        Alan Lyons, who carried out the inspection and tests on the steering gear
                        and equipment on board the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> was
                        based in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Convenience of a trial in Singapore because foreign witnesses (from
                        both sides) could testify via video-link, a facility that is not available
                        if trial is held in Malaysia, a view that was also confirmed by the
                        defendant’s expert on Malaysian law, Mr Arun A/L
                            Krishnalingam.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In the case of surveyors based in Malaysia,
                        their survey reports could easily be made available for a trial in
                        Singapore. If their testimony was required, the surveyors could easily
                        travel to Singapore given the geographical proximity between Singapore and
                        Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        place of collision was fortuitous. The tort was committed as both vessels
                        navigated through Malaysian territorial waters <em>en
                            </em><em>route</em> to Singapore for bunkers.
                        But for the collision the vessels would have left Malaysian territorial
                        waters for Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     The laws of Malaysia in relation to the collision were substantially
                        the same as the corresponding areas of Singapore law. Thus, the identity of
                        the governing law was a neutral factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_f"></a>(f)     Uncertainty as to the availability of VTIS
                        evidence tracking the movements of the vessels at the material times. Even
                        if radar data existed, the data would not be available to the parties
                        without first obtaining a court order in Malaysia. It was explained by the
                        plaintiff’s expert on Malaysian law that the data was protected from
                        disclosure under the Malaysian Official Secrets Act 1972, and that the
                        Malaysian courts would not order its disclosure if MMD withheld consent for
                        its disclosure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                        Mr Seow argued that compared to the VTIS evidence, the VDR data that
                        was already disclosed was more relevant in resolving the collision liability
                        issue. The VDR data would have information on the vessels’ relative
                        positions, course and speed before and in the moments leading up the
                        collision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_g"></a>(g)     MMD’s investigations were routine marine safety investigations and
                        the relevance of evidence of the MMD officers and the MMD’s
                        investigations were not explained by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_h"></a>(h)     The Malaysian Action was commenced for
                        the sole purpose of founding jurisdiction to take advantage of lower limits
                        of liability under Malaysian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion and Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Admiralty jurisdiction and forum shopping</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before I turn to consider the application of
                    the <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles to the facts
                    of this case, I should first say a few words about the classic <em>in rem</em> proceedings and forum shopping, and the close
                    association between the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The lack of substantive connection to any
                    particular jurisdiction is not an unusual feature of ships engaged in
                    international maritime commerce. Often, the only connection with a country is
                    the ship’s presence there and where <em>in rem</em>
                    proceedings are served or the ship arrested. The significant point about
                        <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction is that it is invoked
                        <em>in rem</em> in accordance with a procedure
                    recognised by international convention <em>ie</em>, the
                    International Convention on Arrest of Seagoing Ships, 1952 (“the Arrest
                    Convention”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Frequently allied to admiralty jurisdiction is
                    the notion of forum shopping. Lord Simon in <em>The Atlantic
                        Star</em> [1974] AC 436 explained “forum
                    shopping” in the context of ocean going vessels in these vivid words (at
                    473):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Forum shopping” is, indeed, inescapably involved with the
                        concept of maritime lien and the action in rem. Every port is automatically
                        an admiralty emporium. ....</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Sixteen years later, in more sombre and
                    legalistic tones, Russell LJ in <em>First National Bank of Boston
                        v Union Bank of Switzerland and others</em> [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
                    32 at 38 explained his understanding of “forum shopping” in a
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> context:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The expression “forum shopping” is commonly used to describe
                        the institution of proceedings whereby plaintiffs seek to compel defendants
                        to litigate issues in one jurisdiction when these are already being or about
                        to be litigated in another jurisdiction which is suitable for their
                        resolution. It also frequently involves an attempt to persuade the Courts of
                        one country to arrogate to themselves a jurisdiction which belongs more
                        properly to the Courts of another country, so that the grant of the
                        plaintiff’s application in one jurisdiction may involve a breach of
                        comity towards the Courts of another country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As ships ply worldwide in trade, there are
                    opportunities for a foreign claimant with a maritime claim to arrest the ship or
                    sister ship in a foreign jurisdiction so long as the foreign ship or sister ship
                    is found in a country whose domestic laws have adopted the Arrest Convention.
                    From this perspective, the claimant would be seen to be forum shopping in
                    “an admiralty emporium”. Another aspect of forum shopping has to
                    do with limitation of liability for maritime claims. There are two international
                    conventions for limitation of liability for maritime claims: the International
                    Convention relating to Limitation of Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships 1957
                    (“the 1957 Convention”) and the Convention on Limitation of
                    Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (“the 1976 Convention”). The
                    former provides for lower limits of liability while the latter provides for
                    higher limits. However, it is easier to break limits to establish unlimited
                    liability under the 1957 Convention than under the 1976 Convention. The
                    motivation is self-evident in the present case: Singapore applies the 1976
                    Convention and Malaysia the 1957 Convention. Whilst understandable, the
                    plaintiff’s suggestion that Singapore was a more appropriate forum was
                    really based entirely on its desire to choose a forum with higher limits under
                    the 1976 Convention. In fact, according to Mr Seow’s calculations,
                    the limitation fund of the <em>Reecon Wolf</em> under the
                    1957 Convention is approximately US$550,940 as compared to a limitation fund of
                    approximately US$2.91m under the 1976 Convention. Since the statutory limits in
                    Singapore are higher than the plaintiff’s claims, the potential to recover
                    its full claims is an obvious advantage to the plaintiff litigating in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The different limitation regimes bring me back
                    to forum shopping and <em>in rem</em> actions. Nigel Meeson
                    and John Kimbell in <em>Admiralty Jurisdiction and
                        Practice</em> (Informa, 4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2011)
                    rightly observed at para 7.30:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This dichotomy of [limitation of liability] regimes has not surprisingly
                        provided fertile ground for forum shopping in collision cases, and given
                        rise to a line of cases grappling with the problem of what effect to give an
                        argument that a stay should or should not be granted by reason of the other
                        forum applying the 1957 Convention, England is applying the 1976
                        Convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     With judicial chauvinism firmly replaced by
                    judicial comity, the dichotomy of the limitation regimes that used to be fought
                    out as a loss of juridical advantage is now gone. It would be contrary to
                        <em>The Spiliada</em> principles to look favourably
                    upon a party who selected a forum based solely upon the level of damages that
                    could be awarded or higher limits of liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Russell LJ’s definition of forum
                    shopping is applicable to admiralty actions but, in my view, with a caveat: the
                    definition is to be used in a setting with reference to the principles and
                    reality in which admiralty jurisdiction operates (<em>ie</em>, <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above) and to the
                        <em>in rem</em> factor described in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above. Through <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> principles, harmony is achieved in the exercise of the
                    court’s discretion in which due regard is given to international
                    comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I will discuss international comity in more
                    detail later. Suffice it to say at this juncture that, this court was concerned
                    with comity amongst other considerations in the exercise of discretion, and more
                    so, with the decision by the Malaysian court on the place of
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Spilidia: Stage 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I now turn to consider the factors identified
                    by the parties in relation to the two sets of proceedings (<em>ie</em>, the Singapore Action and the Malaysian Action) and, without
                    a doubt, they overlap considerably. The overlap is not surprising because the
                    two sets of proceedings were based on the same collision, the same facts and the
                    same parties. Whilst the existence of the Malaysian Action is not a decisive
                    factor, its relevance in the inquiry whether Malaysia is clearly a more
                    appropriate forum is by no means marginal. By the same token, the Singapore
                    Action is one of the circumstances to be considered by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Taking the factors identified by the parties
                    as a whole because of the overlap, I was satisfied that insofar as convenience
                    of witnesses as a factor was concerned, there was no balance of advantage for
                    witnesses in a trial in either Singapore or Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was common ground that the vessels, owners,
                    officers and crew were foreign. For this litigation, the foreign officers and
                    crew on duty at the material time would be likely witnesses to the events
                    immediately prior to the collision itself. They would have to travel to give
                    evidence whether the trial was in Singapore or Malaysia. Furthermore, I did not
                    think there was anything in the parties’ respective concerns about witness
                    compellability. In collision cases, the common experience is that officers and
                    crew members required as witnesses of fact continue to be in the employment of
                    the shipowners in order to ensure their attendance at the trial to give
                    evidence. If necessary, evidence by deposition of witnesses is available whether
                    the trial is in Singapore or Malaysia. As to expert evidence, the parties would
                    be able to deploy appropriate experts whether the matter was determined in
                    Malaysia or here. There is much truth in Sheen J’s observations in
                        <em>The Wellamo</em> [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 229,
                    which I gratefully adopt, that “the convenience of those who are
                    professionally interested in litigation should carry little weight in comparison
                    with the convenience of those whose normal occupation in life will be
                    interrupted by attendance in court to give evidence”. Equally, there
                    should be no difficulty with surveyors who examined the damage to both vessels.
                    As for surveyors who made reports in which they recorded what they saw, it would
                    be unrealistic to think that they would be able to remember the condition of the
                    damage to be different and depart from facts set out in their reports which
                    would be tendered in evidence at any trial. Whether the reports or other
                    documents were originally from Singapore or Malaysia, disclosure of documents
                    would take place either here or in Malaysia. Technical and maintenance records
                    of the vessels would largely be a matter of documentary record and would be
                    available in both Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     There were arguments on the uncertainties in
                    terms of availability and relevance of VTIS evidence, and the MMD’s formal
                    investigation report. Notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding the matters,
                    I found them to be of little significance. Neither would temporary repairs in
                    Malaysia lend any support to the defendant’s stay
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In relation to Mr Mohan’s reliance
                    on <em>Goh Suan Hee v Teo Cher Teck</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 367 (“<em>Goh </em><em>Suan </em><em>Hee</em>”) as
                    authority for the proposition that Malaysian law would apply to issues of
                    liability and quantum of damages, I disagreed with Mr Mohan’s reading
                    of that case. It is still an open question whether the Singapore court will
                    treat quantification of damages as substantive rather than procedural so as to
                    apply the <em>lex loci delicti</em> to this issue (see
                        <em>Goh Suan Hee</em> at [24]). In the circumstances, the governing law was a neutral
                    factor as Mr Seow contended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     More importantly on the facts, this court
                    should be concerned with comity amongst other considerations in the exercise of
                    its discretion to stay proceedings. Taking the point on witnesses’
                    testimony above, it would be no doubt unsatisfactory for witnesses both in terms
                    of convenience and expense to have to testify twice in two different courts in
                    two countries because of the concurrent proceedings. This brings me back to the
                    views of Lord Diplock in <em>The Abidin Daver</em> at [344]
                    which I had referred to at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a suit about a particular subject matter between a plaintiff and a
                        defendant is already pending in a foreign court which is a natural and

                        defendant in the foreign suit seeks to institute as plaintiff an action in
                        England about the same matter to which the person who is the plaintiff in
                        the foreign suit is made defendant, then additional inconvenience and
                        expense which must result from allowing two sets of legal proceedings to be
                        pursued concurrently in two different countries where the same facts will be
                        in issue and the testimony of the same witnesses required, can only be
                        justified if the would-be plaintiff can establish objectively by cogent
                        evidence that there is some personal or [juridical] advantage that would be
                        available to him only in the English action that is of such importance that
                        it would cause injustice to him to deprive him of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Quite apart from the additional inconvenience and expense, if the two
                        actions are allowed to proceed concurrently in the two jurisdictions the
                        courts of the two countries may reach conflicting decisions. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     With the above comments in mind, in my view,
                    the main factors in the circumstances of this case were: (a) the concurrent
                    proceedings; (b) the place of the commission of the tort, and (c) international
                    comity. I would add that the plaintiff’s failure to obtain a stay of the
                    Malaysian Action constituted a further consideration against Singapore being the
                    more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   Concurrent proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Earlier, I mentioned matters relating to
                    convenience of witnesses in the light of litigation between the two parties in
                    two separate jurisdictions and where the roles of plaintiff and defendant in one
                    jurisdiction were reversed in the other jurisdiction. Further, the <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction was invoked as of right in the
                    Singapore Action as was the case in the Malaysian Action. I had already
                    described the status of both proceedings as being the same and not very
                    advanced. Nevertheless, the existence of both proceedings was compelling in
                    themselves bearing in mind that each litigation was founded on the same cause of
                    action between the same parties and that questions such as the failure of the
                        <em>Reecon Wolf’s</em> steering gear, the reasons
                    for such failure, whether the defendant were negligent or at fault and the
                    degree of such fault, including contributory negligence on the part of those on
                    board the <em>Capt Stafanos</em> had to be resolved in both
                        proceedings<em>.</em> There were obvious overlaps
                    between such issues in each jurisdiction and the undisputed application of
                    substantially the same principles of law and the Convention for the
                    International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 on the liability
                    issue by each to determine who was to be blamed is dependent on findings of fact
                    that could turn out to be inconsistent and irreconcilable. It is to me
                    self-evident that a risk of conflicting judgments was indeed real, being
                    satisfied that Malaysia was a natural forum as opposed to this court which had
                    no substantial connections with the collision or the parties. A further
                    consideration for present purposes was the plaintiff’s failure to stay the
                    Malaysian Action. In the course of the hearing of RA 94, the High Court of
                    Malaya at Malacca concluded (following dismissal of the Malaysian Stay
                    Application) that it could and should deal with the Malaysian Action. Not only
                    was there a real risk of conflicting judgments if the two actions were pursued
                    in different jurisdictions, the court in the jurisdiction where the tort was
                    committed had decreed it proper and appropriate to continue to exercise
                    jurisdiction. The Malaysian Action would continue despite the Singapore Action,
                    and one solution would be to stay the Singapore Action. This approach is in
                    keeping with the reasoning of Adrian Briggs in <em>Civil
                        Jurisdiction and Judgments</em> (Informa, London,
                        5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2009) at 455:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the foreign proceedings will continue despite the existence of the
                        English proceedings, it may be more appropriate to allow the parties’
                        rights to be determined by the foreign court than to create the conditions
                        for a conflict of judgments by permitting the English proceedings to
                        continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   Place of the tort</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The place of commission of the tort is a
                    factor in favour of Malaysia. The alleged tort was committed within the
                    territorial waters of Malaysia, and the place of the tort is <em>prima facie</em> the natural and appropriate forum for the trial of
                    the action, <em>ie</em>, one in which the action could be
                    tried more suitably for the interests of both parties and the ends of justice
                    (see <em>The Spiliada</em> at 476).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I agreed with Mr Seow that there would be
                    no natural forum if the collision was in the high seas. The collision occurred
                    in Malaysian territorial waters, and the place of the tort would not change
                    simply because the vessels’ activities prior to the collision were
                    transient in nature. In this case, the focus should be on where the cause of
                    action arose – physical damage, a constituent of the cause of action, was
                    sustained when the vessels collided in Malaysian territorial waters. Whilst the
                    jurisdiction in which the tort was committed is normally the forum in which it
                    is just and reasonable for the wrongdoer to answer for his wrongdoing, this is
                    only a <em>prima facie</em> position. <em>The Peng Yan</em> cited by Mr Seow adopted the same approach. Ma
                    CJHC said at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is therefore important when applying <em>The
                            Albaforth</em> principle in the context of <em>forum non conveniens</em> applications, to examine just how close
                        a connection there really exists with any given <em>forum</em>. In some cases, the place of the commission of the
                        tort may be decisive; in others, perhaps not weighty at all. The underlying
                        principle to be firmly borne in mind is the basic test in <em>The Spiliada</em> and <em>The Adhiguna
                            Meranti</em>. <em>The place of the commission of
                            the tort may in some cases be quite fortuitous and may provide no more
                            than a convenient starting point or prima facie position. The court is
                            required to look into more substantial factors in the application of the
                            basic test.</em> The present case involved a collision where,
                        quite often, there is no obvious or natural forum: see <em>The Spiliada</em> at p. 477C-D.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In this case, the <em>prima
                        facie</em> position was not displaced by the factors identified by the
                    plaintiff. The decision of the Malaysia’s court to exercise jurisdiction
                    constituted a further consideration against Singapore being the more appropriate
                    forum. In other words, the outcome of the Malaysian Stay Application (and until
                    the decision is reversed on appeal), was a factor which I had to bear in mind
                    when exercising the court’s discretion whether to stay the Singapore
                    Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Considerations of Comity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Considerations of comity have been applied in
                    our local cases (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>-<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). I also found the decision of the
                    Canadian Supreme Court in <em>Amchem Products</em>
                    instructive. Although <em>Amchem Products</em> is concerned
                    with the granting of anti-suit injunctions, it has been cited frequently in
                    Canada for its enunciation of the principles of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> in stay of proceedings and pronouncements on the role
                    of international comity. In particular, I found persuasive the Canadian Supreme
                    Court’s holding to respect the decision by the foreign court, applying the
                    same <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles (this was
                    common ground), on the place of trial (at 931-932):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the domestic court as a matter of comity must take cogni[s]ance of the
                        fact that the foreign court has assumed jurisdiction. If, applying the
                        principles relating to <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                        outlined above, the foreign court could reasonably have concluded that there
                        was no alternative forum that was clearly more appropriate, the domestic
                        court should respect that decision and the application should be dismissed.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It is common ground that <em>The Spiliada</em> principles are applicable in Malaysia. That the
                    Malaysian court, applying <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                    principles, refused to stay the Malaysian Action and decided that Malaysia would
                    be the more appropriate forum to resolve the dispute between the parties is a
                    weighty consideration. Added to this is my own view that Malaysia was a natural
                    forum. Therefore, a stay of the Singapore Action would avoid the inconvenience
                    and expenses of two trials and the risk of conflicting judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Spilidia: Stage 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     At the end of Stage 1, I was left with no
                    doubt that Malaysia was clearly a more appropriate forum than this court. This
                    brings me to Stage 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Seow was unable to point to any
                    personal or juridical advantage in which the plaintiff would be deprived of if
                    this court granted a stay of the Singapore Action. In written submissions,
                    Mr Seow argued that the dichotomy between the two limitation regimes would
                    leave the plaintiff disadvantaged if the Singapore Action was stayed for
                    Malaysia’s domestic law gave effect to the 1957 Convention. In other
                    words, the plaintiff’s claim would be subject to the lower 1957 limits of
                    liability. This line of argument would invariably draw this court to make
                    comparisons between the merit of the statutory limits in Singapore and
                    Malaysian. I cannot be drawn into making comparisons between the laws of this
                    country and that of another friendly state to do justice in such
                cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Second, the fact that the law in the
                    alternative forum may be less favourable to the plaintiff does not necessarily
                    justify a dismissal of the stay application on ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> As stated, the existence of different
                    limitation regimes is not considered a personal or juridical advantage under
                    Stage 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Mohan referred me to my decision in
                        <em>Evergreen </em><em>International SA
                        v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR (R)
                    457 (“<em>Evergreen International</em>”)
                    which was upheld on appeal. Although it is a case on anti-suit injunction, it is
                    instructive both in terms of admiralty action <em>in
                        rem</em> and international comity. It is convenient and expedient to
                    refer to some paragraphs of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    [A]s Rix J in
                                <em>Caspian Basin</em> acknowledged, the 1957
                            Convention is not an unjust regime and jurisdictions which adhere to
                            that system are not less civilised for doing so. The fact that
                            s 136 Merchant Shipping Act provides for 1957 limit may well be a
                            disadvantage to the defendants in Singapore, but it cannot be properly
                            termed an injustice. Selvam J in <em>The Owners of the
                                Ship or Vessel Ming Galaxy v The Owners of the Ship or Vessel or

                                [(“<em>The Herceg Novi</em>”)],
                            when asked to stay a Singapore action for London where a higher limit is
                            available in England, made the following observations which are
                            similarly relevant to the present case on anti-suit
                        injunction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Then comes the question of substantial justice. This is based on the
                            high limitation fund under English law. The defendants say that if the
                            Singapore action continues they will be deprived of the higher
                            limitation fund under English legislation. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>The true meaning and effect of the
                                defendants’ submission based on the question of substantial
                                justice is that something is lacking in the system of justice of
                                Singapore as regards limitation of liability. I am not aware of a
                                decision anywhere whereby a court has stayed an action legitimately
                                brought before it on the ground that there is something wanting in
                                its system of justice and that better justice will be done in
                                another jurisdiction. For my part it would be wrong in principle to
                                do so because I cannot accept that the law of Singapore is unjust to
                                either party. As the Singapore legislature had deemed it just [to]

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    Arising out of the incident in Singapore, the
                            owners of <em>Herceg Novi</em> separately commenced
                            proceedings in England. A sister ship of the <em>Ming
                                Galaxy</em> was arrested in England. The English Court of
                            Appeal in [<em>The Herceg Novi</em> (UK)] stayed
                            the English proceedings for Singapore. It did not accept that there was
                            juridical advantage for three reasons. Firstly, the 1976 Convention was
                            not universally accepted. Secondly, the International Maritime
                            Organisation, which commended the 1976 Convention to the international
                            community, was not a legislature and thirdly, it was quite impossible to
                            say that substantial justice was not available in Singapore. The
                            plaintiffs’ preference (like the defendants here) for 1976 limit
                            had no greater justification than for the 1957 regime. The Court of
                            Appeal held that whilst the 1976 Convention provided a greater degree of
                            certainty, in terms of abstract justice, neither Convention was
                            objectively more just that the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At the time Selvam J decided <em>The Herceg Novi</em>, Singapore applied the 1957 Convention,
                    and this was the position under Singapore law until the law was amended to pass
                    into domestic legislation the 1976 Convention with effect from 1 May 2005.
                    Even though the situation is now reversed, it would be a strange result if this
                    court did not arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Since I formed the view that the litigation
                    between the parties to this action arising out of the collision could be more
                    appropriately tried in Malaysia and that the plaintiff would suffer no juridical
                    disadvantage from a trial in Malaysia, the justice of the case therefore
                    demanded that the Singapore Action be stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I accordingly ordered a stay of the Singapore
                    Action. The following orders were made:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     Appeal allowed on condition that
