<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Background To The Application</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        KLW Holdings Ltd

("KLW") owns a subsidiary company known as Barang Barang Pte Ltd ("Barang

Barang"). This subsidiary was, at all material times, in the business of retailing

home furnishing products. Sometime about 2000 KLW had bought over Barang Barang from its

founding partners, Mr. Sonny Boey and Mr. Alvin Chua. The two former partners continued

their ties with the company by signing service contracts with it, but these agreements

were terminated (with ensuing litigation between the two partners and Barang Barang).

Payments due from KLW to the two partners in respect of the purchase of Barang Barang were

terminated by KLW. There were allegations by KLW that the two former partners were in

breach of the purchase agreement because they had set up business in competition with

Barang Barang. Arising from these events, the Business Times, a newspaper owned by

Singapore Press Holdings Ltd, published a story on 22 February 2002. KLW is unhappy over

two aspects of the published story, which, it says, created the impression that KLW

defaulted in its payments to Mr. Boey and Mr. Chua from the outset. Mr. Mulani, counsel

for KLW submitted that the payments were stopped because of the alleged breach of

agreement by the two former partners. Secondly, KLW alleges that the Business Times story

suggested that KLW defaulted because it was in financial difficulties. Singapore Press

Holdings denies that the Business Times story is in any way libelous.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        KLW applied by way of this

Originating Summons for pre-trial discovery of documents against Singapore Press Holdings.

The documents required were described in the applications as:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"a.        notes of interview,

  in documentary or mechanical form, with the maker of the statements 'there was a clause

  that said the two men had to be paid for their stakes first. But since the takeover, KLW

  has been defaulting on the payment,' appearing in the article, and</p>
<p align="justify">b.        working drafts of the

  article made in the course of publishing the said article".</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Broad Issues</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        There was no disguise that

the purpose of the discovery application was to ascertain the source from which the

Business Times obtained its information. It is obvious that KLW intends to take whatever

action that it may be advised against the source. The assistant registrar dismissed the

application and KLW appealed against that decision before me. Mr. Hri Kumar submitted on

behalf of Singapore Press Holdings that KLW is not entitled to the discovery sought

because it is, in substance, an application for an order that Business Times discloses its

source of information. Mr. Kumar relies on the "newspaper rule" developed by the

common law courts in England that protects the identity of a newspaper's source. Secondly,

Mr. Kumar says, that even if we do not recognise such protection in Singapore, the court

has a discretion in deciding whether such discover may be ordered. Thirdly, he submitted,

even if discovery of the identity of the source is permitted, the documents required by

KLW are irrelevant and that the information sought by KLW ought to have been asked for by

way of interrogatory rather than a discovery of the specified documents.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        KLW's application was made

under O 24 r 5, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1.        The Defendants shall

  within 14 days of the order to be made hereon, give discovery of the following  

  documents pertaining to the article entitled "<i>KLW in tussle with Barang Barang

  founder</i>" appearing in The Business Times on Friday, 22 February 2002, viz.: -</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">            

  a.        notes of interview, in documentary or

  mechanical form, with the maker of the statements "<i>There was a clause that said

  the two men had to be paid for their stakes first. But since the takeover, KLW has been

  defaulting on the payment,</i>" appearing in the said article, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">            

  b.        working drafts of the article made in the

  course of publishing the said article.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">  2.        The said discovery

  shall be made by way of a list of documents, together with an affidavit verifying the said

  list, filed and served upon the Plaintiffs within 14 days of the order made hereon,

  stating whether the listed documents are or at any time have been in the Defendants’

  possession, custody or power and, if not now in their possession, custody or power, when

  they parted with the same and what has become of them."</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The "Newspaper Rule"</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Counsel have conveniently

referred to Mr. Kumar's mainline objection as the "newspaper rule". It appears

from the reported authorities that the origin of this "rule" is vague. The rule

has sometimes being conveniently regarded merely as a rule of practice (as per Lord

Denning in <i>Att. Gen v Mulholland</i> -see below). In <i>Broadcasting Corporation Of New

Zealand v Alex Harvey Industries Ltd</i> [1980] 1 NZLR 163 it is described as "an

exception from the general rule that a party to a suit must make discovery of and produce

for inspection all documents relevant to the action and answer all relevant

interrogatories. The rule is that newspapers will not be compelled to disclose sources of

information in pre-trial discovery, including both production of documents and answers to

interrogatories". <i>Per</i> McMullin J. This rule was examined in some detail in <i>British

Steel Corporation v Granada Television Ltd</i> [1980] 3 WLR 774. The facts there are

fairly simple. Granada Television (the defendant) aired a documentary programme about the

steel strike in Britain about that time. Confidential documents belonging to the British

Steel Corporation (the plaintiff) were used in the programme. It was not disputed that the

person (or persons) who released those documents to Granada Television was in breach of

his duty of confidentiality. Alexander Irvine QC, counsel for Granada Television made no

attempt to suggest that the defendant received or used the documents in ignorance of their

confidential nature. It was thus accepted for the purpose of the proceedings there that

the defendant used the documents with the knowledge that it was in contravention of the

British Steel Corporation's rights. Sir Robert Megarry V-C heard application by the

British Steel Corporation at first instance. The plaintiff had sought, among other

prayers, an order that Granada discloses the names of those who supplied it with the

confidential documents. The primary proposition of Irvine QC, as summarised by Sir Robert

Megarry, was that "the court has the discretion to refuse to order disclosure where

disclosure would be in breach of some ethical or social value, and that the confidential

relationship between newspapers or other media of information and their sources of

information was an ethical or social value which the court ought to protect by refusing to

order any disclosure". Sir Robert Megarry's order for disclosure was taken by Granada

to the House of Lords, when it failed to persuade any of the Justices of Appeal in the

Court of Appeal to its cause. Irvine QC's solitary success was to secure the dissent of

Lord Salmon who was of the view that the "newspaper rule" had been too well

established that "it would be wrong to sweep the immunity away" [1980] 3 WLR

774, at 846. Woodhouse J (and the two other appeal court judges) in the <i>Broadcasting

Corporation Of New Zealand</i> case was in full agreement with Lord Salmon but he went

further to express that the time had come to extend the rule even to disclosure at trial

(See [1980] 1 NZLR 163, 169.)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        The <i>British Steel

Corporation</i> case follows closely to the modern juristic landmark, <i>Norwich Pharmacal

v Customs And Excise Commissioners</i> [1974] AC 133. That was a case in which the court

held that the defendants were obliged to reveal the names of illicit importers of a drug

known as <i>furazolidone</i> on the ground that the illegal activity infringed the

plaintiff's patent. The application was allowed on the ground that a person who is

involved in a tortious act, even though innocuously, is obliged to assist those who are

injured by that act, and must, therefore, disclose the names of the wrongdoers. So,

strictly speaking, these two important cases were not dealing specifically with the

newspaper rule although strong dicta on the rule are to be found in all the judgments in

the<i> British Steel Corporation</i> case. Counsel also made reference to numerous other

cases in various jurisdictions including, Hong Kong, Canada and Australia, that had

considered the application of the newspaper rule; but none of them are from Singapore. The

courts are not all of like mind on the question as to whether the rule exists or should

exist, and if so, the basis for its existence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        I have set out above what

the so-called "newspaper rule" is, but it will be helpful to examine a short

passage from the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. in <i>Att. Gen v Mulholland</i> [1963] 2 QB

477, 490 in which he talks about the basis of that rule in these words:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The courts will not as a rule compel a newspaper in a libel

    action to disclose before the trial the source of its information. The reason is because,

    on weighing the considerations involved, the balance is in favour of exempting the

    newspaper from disclosure. The person who is defamed has his remedy against the newspaper

    and that is enough, without letting him delve round to see who else he can sue. It may

    rightly be said, as Buckley L.J. said in <i>Adam v Fisher</i> (1914) 30 TLR 288, CA, that

    the public has an interest to see that the newspapers are not compelled to disclose their

    source of information; unless, I would add, the interests of justice so demand. But that

    rule is not a rule of law; it is only a rule of practice which applies in those particular

    cases. It is made more general now and applies not only to newspapers but to other persons

    in the particular circumstances covered by RSC Ord 31, r 1A. It seems to me that whenever

    a case arises when the interests of justice or of the public require that there should be

    disclosure and the judge so rules, the newspapers must disclose the source of their

    information; they have no privilege in law to refuse."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">That the precise reasons for this rule is not clear is evident from

diverse judicial comments such as that of Lindley LJ in <i>Hennessy v Wright (No. 2)</i>

24 QBD 445, 449 and the Court of Appeal in <i>Hope v Brash</i> [1897] 2 QB 188 also

referring to the rule as a "rule of practice" as did Lord Denning in the <i>Mulholland</i>

case. In cases, such as <i>British Steel Corporation,</i> where attempts were made to

rationalize the rule, the usual approach was to regard the public interest as the basis

for its existence. The public interest at stake, in the opinion of the judges who adopted

this approach, is the "public interest in the free flow of information" (See

Lord Salmon's judgment in the <i>British Steel Corporation</i> case, and that of the Hong

Kong Court of Appeal in <i>Sham John v Eastweek Publisher Ltd</i> [1995] 1 HKC 264. The

Canadian courts in <i>Reid v Telegram</i> <i>Publishing Co Ltd</i> [1961] 28 DLR (2d) 6,

and <i>Wismer v MacClean-Hunter Publishing Co Ltd</i> [1954] 1 DLR 501 (not followed in

the later <i>Reid</i> case), and also the Australian decision in <i>McGuinness v

Attorney-General For Victoria</i> 63 CLR 73, considered the rule in terms of public

policy, which is really not quite the same thing as the public interest. In the case of

the latter, an objective comparison of competing public interests (such as that between

the desirability of a free flow of information and the needs of administering justice).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        If the rule exists by

reason of public policy or, in the public interest, then it can only be examined and

established according to the circumstances of the individual jurisdiction. For my part, I

see no need to adopt either public policy or public interest as the direct or main ground

for recognising or not recognising the "newspaper rule" in our jurisdiction. I

hold this view because I think that the issue may be dealt with sufficiently without

reliance on public policy or a comprehensive balancing of public interests. Public policy,

as all lawyers know, is an unruly horse - best left to be tamed in the stable of the

legislature. I shall elaborate shortly as to the question of the public interest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        The privilege of exemption

from the court's power to order disclosure in civil cases, has been granted, as far as I

know, only under the Legal Profession Act. That privilege is extended not to the lawyer

but to his client. Journalists, like members of respectable callings such as priests and

doctors, have not this privilege. It is a privilege borne of a necessity towards the

administration of justice; especially so in an adversarial system of litigation such as we

have. The confidentiality between doctor and patient, or between priest and parishioner,

is one aspect of their relationship (admittedly, a very important one) but it is not as

all encompassing as that between the lawyer and his client. Confidentiality between the

client and his lawyer is inherent, and arises as a matter of course, in the litigation

process (and where potential litigation can be contemplated), and forms the very essence

of that relationship. Furthermore, where the privilege is specifically created by statute,

as in the case of the solicitor and his client, the material question is whether the

courts may or ought to confer the same privilege to other categories of persons. I think

not. The authorities from England and its antipodes rely on a rule that was recognised to

be applied for over a hundred years, and which in turn, was based on a balance of public

interests, (and possibly on grounds of public policy as well). The public interest that

appears to be a matter of great persuasion in the judgments that Mr. Kumar relies on is

the interest of the public to a free flow of information, and freedom of the press. Mr.

Kumar further submitted that the sources of information to the press will dry up if

confidentiality of their identity cannot be maintained. He argues that "investigative

journalism has proved itself a useful adjunct of the freedom of the press". In my

view, this aspect of the public interest cannot be considered in isolation and must be

evaluated against the corollary interest of the public in having a responsible press. But

if Sir Robert Megarry thought that the term "investigative journalism" is a cant

phrase, so too, I think would phrases such as "freedom of the press" and

perhaps, also "responsible press" be. Tempting as it is to do so, I would

decline to examine the meaning of those terms in this judgment because, as I have said, it

is not necessary to do so. I am also loathe to apply a rule merely because it had stood

for over a hundred years in England. From what I have stated above, it will appear that

the so called "newspaper rule" was founded on public policy and public interest

considerations, all of which must be discerned and evaluated in the circumstances of each

individual jurisdiction. In the Hong Kong case of <i>Sham John</i> <i>v Eastweek</i> in

overruling the judge at first instance, Nazareth JA in the Court of Appeal was of the view

that the balance of public interest should be between the balancing of "the interest

in upholding the administration of justice, the bringing of wrongdoers before the court,

and the prevention of injustice" against the "free flow of information"

[1995] 1 HKC 264, at 275. The Court Of Appeal there came down decidedly in favour of the

free flow of information. I cannot find myself agreeing with that view. A free flow of

information cannot mean an unstoppable flow of information. I fear that such a view will

only encourage the unseen character assassin and other mischief makers. I doubt if the

press would condescend to be used in that way. No argument was advanced to persuade me

that if the rule is not recognised, the newspaper's sources of information would cease to

come forward. I think that any such fear is more imagined than real. In most libel actions

the plaintiff's grievances and compensation would have been adequately resolved through

victory over the defendant publisher, and there is usually no need to go further; let

alone go ahead before the action and the determination of whether there is in fact libel.

The "newspaper rule" has had no history in our jurisdiction for me to consider

adopting purely as a matter of practice. It is also well documented that its boundaries

are ill-defined even in those jurisdictions that recognise it. So, for the avoidance of

doubt, I will hold that there is no "newspaper rule" here. But that is not to

say that the applicant is entitled to the information it sought - at this stage.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Pre-Trial Discovery</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        The views that I had

expressed above generally relates not only to the discovery of information in the course

of an action, where it may be presupposed that in ordering discovery the court will always

have regard to the questions of relevancy and admissibility, but also to the pre-trial

stage. It suffices for me to say that therefore, even in the course of an action (whether

at an interlocutory stage or at trial) the court may not order disclosure of the identity

of a newspaper’s informant unless it thinks that it is relevant to do so. The present

application before me is a pre-action discovery application. Slightly different

considerations apply. <i>Prima facia</i>, in such circumstances, the courts are entitled

to lean in favour of confidentiality. What is spoken in confidence ought to be kept in

confidence. Confidentiality must, therefore, be observed unless the greater interests of

justice demand otherwise. The burden of proof lies with the applicant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        Counsel for the plaintiff

and defendant engaged themselves in an extensive debate over the scope and application of

the Australian High Court decision in <i>John</i> <i>Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd v Cojungco</i>

[1988] 165 CLR 346. The five-judge court delivered a single judgment holding that the

media and journalists have no privilege against the disclosure of their sources of

information where justice requires. However, it carried out a balancing exercise of the

tension between the public interest to have a free flow of information and "the

public interest of the litigant in securing a trial of his action on the basis of the

relevant and admissible evidence", and concluded that that "is why the courts

have refused to accord absolute protection on the confidentiality of the journalist’s

source of information, whilst at the same time imposing some restraints on the entitlement

of a litigant to compel disclosure of the identity of the source. In effect, the courts

have acted on the principle that disclosure of the source will not be required unless it

is necessary in the interests of justice. So, generally, disclosure will not be compelled

at an interlocutory stage of a defamation or related action and even at the trial the

court will not compel disclosure unless it is necessary to do justice to the

parties"(<i> ibid</i> at page 354). I respectfully endorse this view and will only

add that the term "in the interests of justice" ought to be regarded cautiously,

and with regard to the specific rules pertaining to relevancy and admissibility of

evidence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        Hence, the privilege, or

otherwise, of a journalist from disclosing his source of information is only one aspect of

question. A person may only be compelled to disclose confidential information only when

the applicant can persuade the court that he has a right to that information. That right

was well proved in the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> and <i>British Steel Corporation</i>

cases. In the present case before me, the plaintiff applicant claims that the defendant

has libeled it. It wants to know who gave the information to the defendant that was used

in the libel, but the defendant disputes that their publication was libelous. Whether it

is or not is the big question for the trial. The disclosure of the source is presently not

relevant. In the <i>Norwich Pharmacal</i> and <i>British Steel Corporation</i> cases the

applicant was able to identify the connection between the information held by the

defendant to the injury it suffered and continues to suffer unless positive steps are

taken to stop it. Nothing close to that has been put before me and, furthermore, until a

real and substantive connection is made, there is no basis at this stage to assume that

the notes and drafts of the journalist would be relevant to the alleged libel. I therefore

hold that even if it is assumed that the identity of the informant is relevant at this

point, the journalist’s notes and drafts cannot be relevant. The issue may, of

course, emerge again at trial when more facts become available, but that is another story.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        The plaintiff is, of

course, entitled to pray for an order for disclosure as part of the reliefs sought should

the trial judge rule in its favour. There being no evidence before me that the plaintiff

will be prejudiced if it has to wait until then, the orders sought by it should not be

allowed and the assistant registrar was therefore correct in dismissing the
