        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a hearing to decide ancillary matters
                    between Ng Ah Yiew (“the Wife”) and Goh Chai Seng (“the
                    Husband”) subsequent to the granting of an interim judgment of divorce to
                    the Wife in March 2009. After hearing counsel for the Wife, and the Husband (who
                    was in person), I made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Husband was to pay the Wife $2m
                        as her share of the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     the property at 25A Hillview Avenue #09-07 The
                        Glendale Singapore 669617 (“the matrimonial property”) was to
                        be sold in the open market within 90 days of the order. The sale proceeds,
                        less sales commission, outstanding outgoings and incidental expenses were to
                        be apportioned 60:40 between the Wife and the Husband
                    respectively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        Wife’s solicitors were to have conduct of the sale of the matrimonial
                        property and in the event that the Husband failed or refused to execute the
                        Option and/or the Transfer and any other relevant documents necessary for
                        the sale after a request in writing from the Wife’s solicitors, the
                        Registrar of the Supreme Court was empowered to execute the documents on his
                        behalf;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     if the
                        Husband failed or neglected to pay the Wife the difference between $2m and
                        her 60% share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial property, the
                        Wife’s solicitors were entitled to retain the Husband’s 40%
                        share of the sale proceeds and utilise the sum to set off against the
                        balance of the $2m due and owing to the Wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_e"></a>(e)     the Husband was to pay the Wife a lump sum of
                        $20,000 by way of maintenance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_f"></a>(f)     the parties were to vacate the matrimonial property within
                        45 days of the exercise of the Option granted for the sale of the same and
                        in the event that the Husband failed or refused to vacate the matrimonial
                        property, the Wife would be at liberty to apply for a writ of
                        possession;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_g"></a>(g)     there would be no order for costs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_h"></a>(h)     parties would have liberty to
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As the Husband has appealed against my orders
                    (in Civil Appeal No. 67 of 2011), I now set out the grounds for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties were married on 3 October 1979. The
                    Wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2008 and was granted interim
                    judgment on 24 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Wife is currently 60 years old while the
                    Husband is 64 years of age. They have a 31 year old son, Goh Wenny (“the
                    son”), who is married. The Husband also has two grown daughters from his
                    previous marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       For most of the marriage, the Husband ran a
                    business which sold and serviced fire-fighting equipment. In May 2005, he had a
                    stroke and his business was eventually terminated in August 2005. He has been
                    unemployed since that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Wife had left her job as a factory operator
                    some five years before the marriage to help the Husband in his business. She
                    continued to work there until the business was terminated in August 2005. She
                    has not been employed thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The assets of the parties as disclosed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The matrimonial property was valued at $1.1m by
                    the Husband and $850,000 – $900,000 by the Wife. Both parties wish to sell
                    the matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the Wife’s part, she alleged that the
                    Husband had not paid her any salary or given her any personal allowance
                    throughout her years of working at his business. The assets she disclosed were
                    the following:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Although the car was registered in her name, it
                    was a family car used by all members of the family. This was corroborated by the
                    son. The Wife was prepared to sell the car pursuant to the divorce. As for the
                    money in her OCBC account, the Wife stated that they were her savings from the
                    money given to her by the son and not the Husband. Throughout the marriage, the
                    Husband had given her money to pay for the business’ expenses, household
                    expenses and basic living expenses, but not for her own personal
                savings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the Husband’s part, only one bank
                    account and his CPF account were disclosed by him in his first affidavit of

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was there a lack of full and frank disclosure on the part of the
                Husband?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Wife argued that the Husband had failed in
                    his duty to give full and frank disclosure and urged this court to draw adverse
                    inferences against him. Before proceeding further, it would be useful to lay
                    down the applicable principles on the drawing of adverse
                inferences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     First, as stated by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 (“<em>BG v BF</em>”) at [52], in the absence of full and frank disclosure, the court is
                    entitled to draw inferences adverse against the party who failed to do so. This
                    disincentivises parties from withholding information, and allows the court to
                    reach a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets even if
                    information is withheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Second, as stated in <em>Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em> [2000] 2
                    SLR(R) 407 at [50], the drawing of an
                    adverse inference in civil cases should not be used as a mechanism for shoring
                    up glaring deficiencies in the opposite party’s case which on its own,
                    would not meet the requisite burden of proof. There must therefore exist a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case against the person against
                    whom an adverse inference is to be drawn. In addition, it must be shown that the
                    person has particular access to the information he is said to be hiding:
                        <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Kuah</em> [2007] SGCA
                    21.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Third, having drawn an adverse inference, the
                    court can order a higher proportion of known matrimonial assets to be given to
                    the other spouse, as was done in <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3
                    SLR(R) 743 (“<em>NK v NL</em>”) and <em>BG v BF</em>. The court can also determine the value of the
                    undeclared assets based on the available information as was done in <em>Tay Sin Tor v Tan Chay Eng</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R)
                385.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In light of these established principles, this
                    court concluded that adverse inferences could and should be drawn against the
                    Husband due to his repeated failure to comply with his duty of full and frank
                    disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, the Husband had been extremely
                    uncooperative throughout the discovery process by refusing to disclose the full
                    extent of his assets. To show that the Husband had more assets than those he had
                    disclosed in his first affidavit of assets and means, the Wife produced, in her
                    second affidavit filed on 3 February 2010, 22 different financial statements
                    belonging to the Husband. Those revealed numerous assets amounting to over $4m
                    which the Husband had failed to disclose. In his third affidavit filed on 14
                    June 2010, the Husband responded to her allegation in the following cavalier
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20. The Plaintiff is fully aware that I had lost the mini binds [<em>sic</em>]. <b><em>As for the other
                            “assets/investments” they had to be sold or realised for
                            my financial needs</em></b> and the demands of the Plaintiff for
                        maintenance as I have been suffering from stroke for the last few
                        years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21. Because of my stroke I had to close down my sole proprietorship
                        – a fire safety business – in 2005. <b><em>As I am
                            not working, I had to dig into my savings and dispose of my investments
                            to pay for the household expenses, maid salary and levy as well as the
                            maintenance fees, property tax etc for the matrimonial
                            property</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     No further elaboration was given and no
                    documentary proof was provided to contradict the Wife’s claims or to
                    substantiate the Husband’s bare and undoubtedly untrue
                assertions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Husband continued to be uncooperative and
                    showed scant regard for the Consent Order made on 22 September 2010 by the
                    District Court. The Consent Order required the Husband to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     state on affidavit whether he had
                        documents in his possession, custody or power showing the full extent of his
                        hidden assets as alleged by the Wife, and to prove his assertions that
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       the mini bond investments
                            were a total loss;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       his insurance policies had been cancelled and
                            that the insurance monies were used for his financial needs;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       his other investments and assets were
                            “sold”/”realised” and used for his financial
                            needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     exhibit a copy of those documents in the affidavit;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     provide reasons
                        together with supporting documentation if he claimed that he did not have
                        the documents in his possession, custody or power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Despite the Consent Order, the Husband
                    continued to be uncooperative and evasive and responded by simply filing an
                    affidavit on 12 November 2010 repeating his position at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, adding:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8. The documents as stated in the Order of Court are not in my possession
                        and I do not have the financial resources or means to retrieve them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As stated earlier at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, barely a week before the hearing, the Husband disclosed
                    four bank accounts for the first time, as listed at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>. However, apart from those bank accounts, nothing was said
                    of the numerous other hidden assets which the Wife proved did
                exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the light of the Husband’s repeated
                    and wilful refusal to satisfactorily disclose the existence or details of his
                    assets, I concluded that there was a lack of full and frank disclosure on his
                    part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, even on the bank accounts disclosed by
                    the Husband, there were substantial withdrawals made <em>after</em> interim judgment was obtained (in March 2009) which were
                    not satisfactorily explained by him. An example is a sum of $38,203.97 withdrawn
                    on 29 June 2009 from his OCBC bank account No.YYY. This left a residual sum of
                    $1,000 which he disclosed. The Husband’s only explanation for the
                    withdrawal was that the money was used to pay his mother. No reasons were
                    offered as to why the money had to be paid. No documents were adduced to show
                    that the money was indeed transferred to his mother. No affidavits were filed by
                    his mother to corroborate his story.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Another example was an unexplained withdrawal
                    of $78,000 from his POSB Savings Account No. BBB which took place on the same
                    day – 29 June 2009. This reduced his then account balance of $78,892.90 to
                    $892.90. No reasons were tendered by the Husband for this withdrawal. Seen
                    together, it was clear that the Husband was dissipating assets from the
                    matrimonial pool to prevent the Wife from getting her fair share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Taking all the circumstances into
                    consideration, in particular the Husband’s repeated failure to
                    satisfactorily disclose the full extent of his assets and to account for
                    substantial withdrawals from his bank accounts, this court drew an inference
                    that the Husband had more assets than he had disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Matrimonial assets available for division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Wife compiled a table of the Husband’s hidden assets in her written submissions:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Some explanation is warranted for items number
                    3, 6 – 9 and 20. For those accounts, the Wife produced financial
                    statements showing different account balances on different dates. The earlier
                    dates, many of which were in 2007 and 2008, showed a significantly higher
                    account balance as compared to the later dates (marked with **). The Wife not
                    surprisingly urged this court to use the account balances at the earlier dates
                    when computing the value of the Husband’s hidden assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I noted that all those accounts showed
                    significant depletions <em>after</em> divorce proceedings
                    were commenced in November 2008. I was conscious of the fact that the Husband
                    had a stroke in May 2005 (to which he made repeated reference) that led to his
                    business closing down. Yet, in the absence of documentary proof, I could not
                    accept the Husband’s bare assertion that all those assets were utilised
                    for “household expenses, maid’s salary and levy as well as the
                    maintenance fees, [and] property tax”. It was wholly improbable that such
                    large sums of money were needed for such purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Consequently, I accepted the Wife’s
                    argument that the account balances at the earlier dates should be used for
                    computing the quantum of the Husband’s hidden assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The total sum of the hidden assets as shown by
                    the Wife amounted to S$4,886,744.24, which consists of the following figures
                    denominated in different currencies:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$3,895,129.98;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     AUD384,339.50 (approximately
                        S$501,491.92 @ AUD1 = S$1.304);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     EUR49,709.27 (approximately S$86,842.97 @ EUR1 =
                        S$1.747); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     NZD385,948.03 (approximately S$403,279.37 @ NZD1 =
                S$1.044))</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     With regard to the assets disclosed by the
                    Husband, I was mindful not to double-count the following assets which were
                    already contained in the list of hidden assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     the account balance of $1,000 as of
                        29 June 2009 in OCBC bank account A/c No: YYY (disclosed in the
                        Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the account balance of $1,562.32 as of
                        13 January 2011 in POSB Savings Account No. BBB;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     the account balance of $46,310.85 as
                        of 30 April 2011 in Maybank Current Account No. ABC and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     the account balance of $1,566.18 as of
                        30 April 2011 in Maybank Savings Account No. PQR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The other disclosed matrimonial assets which I
                    added to the pool of assets liable for division amounted to $918,607.81, which
                    consisted of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     the matrimonial property (valued at
                        $850,000);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        car registered in the Wife’s name (valued at
                    $30,000);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        Wife’s CPF ordinary account (valued at $51.75);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Wife’s OCBC Savings Account
                        No. ZZZ showing an account balance of $22,520.34 as of 1 October
                        2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        Husband’s CPF ordinary account (valued at
                    $7,529.85);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        Husband’s Maybank Unit Trust Account No. XYZ showing an account
                        balance of $8,505.87 as of 30 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Adding the disclosed and hidden assets
                    together, I arrived at a sum slightly over $5.8m (instead of $5.5m as computed
                    by counsel for the Wife).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable Law on the Division of Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The starting point for any division of
                    matrimonial assets is s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev
                    Ed) (“the Charter”) which empowers the court to make a division in
                    such proportions as the court deems “just and
                equitable”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Section 112(2) of the Charter provides a list
                    of factors which a court is required to take into consideration in determining
                    how the matrimonial assets are to be divided. The relevant factors in this case
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the extent of the contributions
                        made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring,
                        improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     ...</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     the needs of the children (if any) of the
                        marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
                        family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or
                        any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either
                    party;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     ...</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_f"></a>(f)     ...</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_g"></a>(g)     the giving of
                        assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not
                        of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support
                        which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation
                        or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_h"></a>(h)     the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are
                        relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim
                        Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260, the Court of Appeal stated at [29]:</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Finally, it is paramount
                    that courts do not focus merely on a direct and indirect contributions dichotomy
                    in arriving at a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. The various
                    factors enumerated by s 112(2) of the Act, which are no less important, must be
                    duly assessed and considered as a whole. At the end of the day, no one factor
                    should be determinative as the court’s mandate is to come to a <em>just and equitable</em> division of the matrimonial assets
                    having regard to <em>all the circumstances of the
                    case</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this regard, it is trite law that a
                    party’s direct financial contributions to the acquisition of any
                    particular matrimonial asset can no longer be primarily determinative of how it
                    is divided, and the court is free to give as much weight or more to other
                    non-financial factors: <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em>
                    [2000] 2 SLR(R) at [32]. The importance
                    of giving the <em>fullest</em> effect to non-financial
                    contributions of the spouse concerned has been stressed repeatedly in case law,
                    for example in <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 at [55].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Finally, the court is to adopt a broad brush
                    approach in deciding what would be a just and equitable division in all the
                    circumstances of a case. This is an exercise largely based on feel and the
                    court’s sense of justice, and the court is not expected to make an exact
                    calculation of each spouse’s contributions, whether financial or
                    non-financial: <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [78] and [81].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On the facts, it was clear that the Husband
                    provided for all the material needs of the family. Of the three properties
                    acquired by the parties, almost all of the money came from the Husband with the
                    exception of the Wife’s contribution of $1,000 from her CPF account
                    towards their second HDB flat. The Husband also provided for the family’s
                    and the business’ expenses during the subsistence of the marriage, which
                    included miscellaneous charges such as travel by the family as well as the
                    son’s fees of $60,000 for his two-year degree programme in
                    Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Nevertheless, in so far as non-financial
                    contributions were concerned, I had no doubt that in the course of the 29 year
                    marriage, it was the Wife who bore the main burden of supporting the family and
                    providing for its welfare, in addition to working for the Husband’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In August 1974, five years before the
                    marriage, the Wife gave up her job as a factory operator to help with the
                    Husband’s business. She continued to work there until the business closed
                    down in 2005. While the Husband repeatedly downplayed the Wife’s
                    contributions by saying that she only performed cleaning, clerical work and
                    answering of phone calls, I found that to be untrue. The Wife had contributed
                    substantially to the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     According to the Wife, she was responsible for
                    calling up contacts for business. She was also responsible for servicing fire
                    extinguishers which the Husband brought back from customers. On average, she
                    would service at least 20 to 30 fire extinguishers daily. Although two workers
                    were initially hired to help her out, the couple stopped hiring in 1996/1997 due
                    to high staff turnover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Wife also played a crucial administrative
                    role. She was in charge of typing and preparing invoices, preparing letters,
                    quoting prices to customers and filing all the paperwork. She was also
                    responsible for keeping records of when customers’ equipment was due for
                    servicing and would prepare a list of companies’ names and their addresses
                    for their equipment to be collected back for servicing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Her instrumental role in the business was
                    evident when the Husband continued to bring work home for her to do during her
                    confinement period and even when she was hospitalised. The Husband could not
                    perform any of those important administrative functions himself and it does not
                    lie in his mouth to now belittle the importance of the Wife’s
                    contributions to the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In fact, after the business had stabilised, it
                    was the Wife who would perform all the work in the office by herself. The son
                    corroborated this fact in his affidavit filed on 24 May 2010 where he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I have read my mother’s 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Affidavit, in which she has set out in detail the work she did at his shop
                        and the hours she worked in paragraphs 7.3 to 7.14, which I confirm to be
                        true. Her work was not limited to merely cleaning, clerical work and
                        answering phone calls. <b><em>In fact she ran the shop for
                            him</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Wife stated that the Husband would rarely
                    help out with the work in the office. The son’s affidavit documented the
                    Husband’s daily routine which comprised of spending most of his time
                    outside the office, returning back to the office after lunch for a nap, leaving
                    the office again and returning back in the evenings to read the newspapers and
                    to wait for the Wife to finish her work before going home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I found the Wife to be a dedicated worker,
                    working from Mondays to Fridays and even on half days on Saturdays. When
                    customers required their fire extinguishers to be serviced urgently, she would
                    work until past 9.00pm. Despite this, she was not paid a salary or given CPF
                    contributions for all the years she worked in the Husband’s business. She
                    was also not given a personal allowance which she could have saved. The Husband
                    only gave her money on a needs basis, for the shop, household and family
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In addition to her dedication to the
                    Husband’s business, the Wife was also a devoted mother, wife and
                    homemaker. She was responsible for bringing up the son during the formative
                    years of his life. The Husband’s contribution in raising the son primarily
                    comprised of driving the son to and from school during the son’s younger
                    years and playing with him occasionally. The Wife took care of the son in every
                    other respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Wife also singlehandedly did all the
                    housework, from cooking dinner, cleaning the house to doing the laundry. The
                    Husband refused to lift a finger to help out at home and would throw a temper
                    when asked to do so. Although the parties later had domestic help, that was
                    primarily to assist the Wife in taking care of the Husband after his stroke in
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Wife’s remarkable devotion to the
                    family was best revealed in the period after his stroke. When he was
                    hospitalised in 2005, she singlehandedly managed the business without him. Yet,
                    she went to the hospital twice daily, once at lunch time and again during dinner
                    time to visit him. She also made it a point to cook dinner for him every single
                    day. When the Husband was discharged from hospital, she had to take care of him
                    and bathe him with the help of the maid. She would send him for his
                    physiotherapy sessions thrice weekly and acupuncture sessions twice weekly. She
                    would also accompany him to Bukit Batok Nature Park every day from 7am –
                    9am for him to exercise as part of his rehabilitation. This routine continued
                    until November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I pause briefly to note that the Wife gave her
                    all to the family and the Husband’s business in both good times and bad.
                    The Wife cited numerous occasions where the Husband would abuse her verbally and
                    physically, and would even force himself upon her sexually after his stroke.
                    This resulted in the Wife having to sleep on a mattress on the floor next to the
                    bed as the Husband would kick her off if she refused to be intimate with him.
                    The son’s affidavit largely corroborated the Wife’s version of the
                    facts in this regard and even went on to state that the Husband would often
                    return home drunk and he would be abusive towards the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Having considered all the circumstances of the
                    case including the length of the marriage, I found the Wife to have contributed
                    significantly to the welfare of the family, from looking after the home and
                    raising the son, to taking care of the Husband especially after he became
                    infirmed. She also provided extensive assistance and support to the Husband in
                    the running of his business. Marriage is a social and economic partnership and
                    the matrimonial assets were undoubtedly accumulated during the course of the
                    marriage with the support of the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Adopting a broad brush approach, I was of the
                    view that it was just and equitable that the Wife be awarded $2m from the total
                    pool of matrimonial assets. This works out to be slightly less than 35% of the
                    overall assets available for division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Part of the $2m was to come from the sales
                    proceeds of the matrimonial property. I ordered that the flat should be sold in
                    the open market and that sale proceeds (less sales commission, outstanding
                    outgoings and incidental expenses) be apportioned 60:40 to the Wife and the
                    Husband respectively. The Husband would be required to pay the Wife the
                    difference between $2m and her 60% share of the sale proceeds failing which, the
                    Wife’s solicitors would be entitled to retain the Husband’s 40%
                    share of the sale proceeds and utilise the sum to set off against the balance of
                    $2m awarded to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable Law on Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Section 113 of the Charter empowers the court
                    to make an order for maintenance. In making such an order, the court has to
                    consider all the circumstances of the case, including the factors set out in s
                    114(1) of the Charter:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     the income, earning capacity,
                        property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the
                        marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable
                    future;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties
                        to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable
                    future;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the
                        marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the
                    marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_e"></a>(e)     any
                        physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
                        marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of
                        the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or
                        caring for the family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_g"></a>(g)     in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of
                        marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit
                        (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of
                        the marriage that party will lose the chance of
                acquiring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As stated in <em>BG v
                        BF</em>, (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>) the power to order maintenance is
                    exercised in a manner supplementary to the power to divide matrimonial assets,
                    such that the court takes account of each party's share of the assets, and the
                    order for maintenance plays a complementary role to the order for
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Finally, one must not lose sight of the
                    rationale behind the law imposing a duty on a former husband to maintain his
                    former wife. Essentially, the aim is to even out any financial inequalities
                    between the spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the
                    wife during marriage: <em>Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok
                        Dennis</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 376 at [27].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Wife’s anticipated monthly expenses
                    were $2,260, the bulk of which was for the rental of a two room HDB flat which
                    was estimated to cost $1,500 a month. Adopting a multiplier of 10 years, the
                    Wife’s requested lump sum maintenance would amount to $271,200. At the
                    hearing however, counsel for the Wife indicated her client no longer wished to
                    rent, but intended to purchase a three room HDB flat estimated to cost about
                    $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the light of the Wife’s share of the
                    matrimonial assets, I was of the view that a lump sum of $20,000 by way of
                    maintenance would be an equitable amount in the circumstances, to achieve a
                    clean break between the parties, which was what the Wife wanted. The
                    Wife’s share of $2m of the matrimonial assets would comfortably enable her
                    to purchase a three room HDB flat for her future occupation.</p>
