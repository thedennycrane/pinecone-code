He stated that on 8 April 2021, he had called Mr Ang to wish him a happy birthday and discovered that Mr Ang was attending the auction at which Seascape was being put up for sale. He told Mr Ang not to buy the property as it was involved in legal suits. However, later the same day, Mr Ang called Dr Goh and told him he had placed a deposit to buy Seascape. On 9 April 2021, Mr Ang called Dr Goh and stated that he had bought Seascape as there was no other bidder and intended to let his daughter stay there.

If this gift is not established, the presumption of advancement (which is attracted by relationships such as transfers from husband to wife or father to child) may nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong </span><span class="font-italic">Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 at [160]; <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I briefly touch on the law of constructive trusts as this was pleaded by the plaintiff as well. A constructive trust is generally defined as a trust which arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable for a property owner to assert his own beneficial interest in the property and deny the beneficial interest of another. Here, unconscionability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Eng v Lim Geok Yian </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 812 at [33].  <span class="font-italic">Zaiton</span><span class="font-italic"> bte Adom v Nafsiah bte Wagiman and anor </span>[2022] SGHC 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Zaiton</span>”). at [104].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 An institutional constructive trust arises in real-time without requiring any resort to a court of equity (whereas a remedial constructive trust has to be imposed by the court). It also arises independent of any intention on the part of the beneficiary or trustee to create a trust or to constitute the trustee as a trustee for the beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">Zaiton</span><span class="font-italic"> bte Adom v Nafsiah bte Wagiman and anor </span>[2022] SGHC 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Zaiton</span>”) at [103]–[111]). For an <span class="font-italic">institutional</span> constructive trust to arise, one of the following (non-exhaustive) categories of unconscionability must arise (<span class="font-italic">Zaiton</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [107]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) fraud;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the retention of property acquired as a result of a crime causing death;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a profit in breach of a fiduciary duty;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the retention of property by a vendor after the vendor had entered into a specifically enforceable contract to sell the property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the changing of a will by the survivor of two persons who had entered into a contract to execute wills in a common form;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the acquisition of land expressly subject to the interests of a third party;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the assertion of full entitlement to property after a common intention to share property had been formed (also known as a “common intention constructive trust”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As counsel for the defendants rightly submits, if Mdm Wang intends to rely on fraud as the circumstance under which an institutional constructive trust is founded in the present case, she will have to plead fraud not in terms of fraud <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, but in terms of a situation whereby the defendant fraudulently relies on the informality of a transaction to deny the beneficial interest of the claimant: <span class="font-italic">National Bank of Oman SAOG Dubai Branch v Bikash </span><span class="font-italic">Dhamala and others </span>[2021] 3 SLR 943 at [52].

First, Dr Goh did not seem to have any problem getting large sums of money from her out of those accounts or from their children’s accounts which were pumped up from money from Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s joint accounts. As such, the manner in which they treated the money in their OCBC 501 Account and BOS Joint Account is not consistent with this assertion. Second, Mdm Koh does not satisfactorily explain Dr Goh’s access to the monies other than that he had a bad temper, and nobody dared refuse him. Thirdly, Mdm Koh relies solely on oral evidence. While her oral evidence is corroborated by Dr Goh, he has an interest in the matter at hand and his own evidence in this regard has not been consistent either. More importantly, her evidence in the witness box is not convincing, with quite a few unbelievable answers and shifting evidence, and she has contradicted herself in the previous affidavits she had filed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conveyance of monies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I hence find that there had been a conveyance of monies belonging to Dr Goh to Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account – specifically, the sum of S$1,873,320.63 transferred from Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s joint OCBC 501 Account on 7 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether this conveyance was made with the intent of defrauding creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 According to the defendants, the conveyance was made in return for Dr Jeremy’s agreeing to put up the Seascape property as security.

However, when questioned further, Dr Jeremy stated that he could not remember to whom this request was made in the presence of, whether any group discussions were had regarding the putting up of Seascape to discharge an injunction, any conversations he might have had with Dr Goh in their WhatsApp chat groups where Dr Goh had said “he needed help” as well as who had come up with the idea of mortgaging Seascape.

For one, Dr Goh had stated in March 2016 that “[t]he money in the account is family money … it is jointly owned by my [w]ife, my children and me for our joint family investments”. Dr Goh’s explanation was that the S$18m did not come from him or from any of his single bank accounts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Taking the evidence in its totality, the picture that emerges is as follows. Dr Jeremy had received his alleged gift of S$18m in the OCBC 582 Account, which Dr Goh had at points declared to the court was an account in which he had joint ownership and was aware of the precise quantities of monies held therein. Within a few months of receiving a WhatsApp message from Dr Michelle on Dr Goh’s willingness to transfer his assets to his family and go bankrupt so that his creditors would get nothing, Dr Jeremy then proceeded to transfer S$18m into his HSBC account, and then to route much of that sum to Dr Goh via Ms Melissa. Dr Goh was not able to explain away his seeming knowledge and involvement in transactions involving the OCBC 582 Account, and it is undisputed that he had eventually directed that S$15m be routed back to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Dr Jeremy has not been able to furnish any alternative explanation as to why he had gone about making these transfers. The extent to which he appears to have purged details of any understanding or discussions he may have had with Dr Goh regarding these monies and their movement from his memory is so thorough as to be incredible. There is simply no ring of truth to his account that he accepted the monies as a gift and subsequently transferred the monies to his father purely to help him financially. I find from the evidence that the conveyancing of monies into Dr Jeremy’s account from Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s OCBC 501 Account had been orchestrated by Dr Goh with the intent to defraud his creditors, and Dr Jeremy had notice of Dr Goh’s intention to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff is a person prejudiced by the foregoing conveyance of property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 While it is true (as the defendants highlight in their submissions) that judgment against Dr Goh in Suit 686 and Suit 1311 was only obtained in 2019, the suits were commenced in 2015. Dr Goh’s conveyance of monies over the course of 2016 would directly impact whether Mdm Wang would be able to enjoy the fruits of litigation in the event that she should succeed in Suit 686 (as she eventually did), and she was hence prejudiced by the conveyance made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alternative claim of resulting trusts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As I have found that Dr Goh’s conveyance of monies from the OCBC 501 Account into Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account is voidable under s 73B of the CLPA, I need not address the alternative claim on whether a presumption of resulting trust arises in Dr Goh’s favour vis-à-vis his contributions into Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account. Briefly, I note that for the reasons I have given above, the presumption that the money is held on trust for Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, proportionate to their contribution, has been established by Mdm Wang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The defendants submit that any resulting trust arising in Dr Goh’s favour would be rebutted by the presumption of advancement.

</div> I found this to be an unconvincing explanation of why Dr Jeremy had selectively read some messages pertaining to the mortgage of Seascape but not others, when these messages pertained to the same matter and were sent in the same time frame. The story put before this court is hence that Dr Jeremy was aware that he was to mortgage Seascape and had proceeded to work with Ms Denie (who had been asked by Dr Goh to assist) to do so but had conveniently missed out on the messages which would highlight any intent to defraud creditors in mortgaging Seascape.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Further, the bulk of the mortgage proceeds from both properties either went back to Dr Goh or was used for his benefit.

His bid was not accepted as it was too low, and Seascape was withdrawn from the auction. After the auction ended, Mr Ang made a S$4.5m counteroffer, which was accepted.

At no point had Dr Jeremy been ordered to furnish evidence on the possibility of retrieving deleted data from Telegram. He had only been asked to account for what had happened to those logs. It would have been easy for Dr Jeremy to say from the outset that he had deleted his Telegram logs.

On the same day, Mr Ang called Dr Goh and told him he had placed a deposit to buy Seascape. In cross-examination, it was highlighted to Dr Goh that his evidence was only of two calls and hence did not account for all ten calls that were made between him and Mr Ang on 8 April 2021.

Your Honour, we have been buddies for more than about [ten] years, since 2010, so just because I don’t go gambling means we cannot have fellowship, breakfast, calls regularly, so that’s -- your narrative accusing me that [Mr] Ang have [sic] no longer talk to me because I’m no more a gambler, no money to gamble, he's not that kind of person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The issue at hand was not whether he was still friends or in contact with Mr Ang; the vague justification that they still had fellowship, meals and calls on a regular basis does nothing to explain why as many as <span class="font-italic">ten</span> phone calls were made in one day, in uncanny coincidence with developments at the auction of Seascape. In sum, Dr Goh was a witness whose glib and evasive responses did little to reconcile the gaps and inconsistencies in his evidence. Given the timing and volume of calls made on 8 April 2021, coupled with Dr Goh’s inconsistent and sketchy evidence of these calls, I find that Dr Goh had been involved in the sale of Seascape by private treaty at S$4.5m. I also find that Mr Ang’s Old Phone had, more likely than not, been contaminated, probably by immersing it in seawater.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I am hence of the view that Dr Goh had purchased Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name with the intent to defraud his creditors, and that Dr Jeremy had notice of Dr Goh’s intention to do so. Further, Mdm Wang would be prejudiced by this purchase. The sale and purchase agreement for Seascape was signed on 29 May 2015 and the sale to Dr Jeremy was completed on 11 August 2015,

If I were to take her words at face value, this appears to be a situation where:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) She had been made privy to the difficulties her parents were facing due to the injunction, but no request had been made of her to assist.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) She decided to assist by putting up Berth as security, yet her willingness to help without being asked would be negated out of spite should any request have been made of her.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Dr Jeremy had put up his own property as security for the same purpose at the same time, and yet she was not aware of how he had come to a decision to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 To believe Ms Melissa’s account of events, I would have also to believe that her decision to put up Berth as security is characterised by a confusing mix of altruism and caprice and that Dr Goh’s children have somehow managed to deal with their properties in a perfectly synchronised manner, without any coordination between any members of the family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The untenability of Ms Melissa’s attempts to suggest that she did not know of any attempt to defraud creditors on her father’s part becomes clearer when she was cross-examined on the Elves Group Chat Message. She stated point-blank that Dr Michelle was lying when she said that Ms Melissa had been messaging their father about the ongoing lawsuit against him, as Dr Michelle “was just ranting nonsense and rubbish … to get our attention” and “likes to exaggerate to make a big deal out of things” because the siblings “[do not] give her attention”.

</div> While Ms Melissa’s testimony is that she is uninvolved and ignorant of Dr Goh’s lawsuits and legal troubles to the point of callous disregard, this does not sit well with the evidence of her actions and her responses in the Elves Group Chat.

Ms Melissa states that she had initiated the idea of mortgaging Berth as she wished to help the family with cash flow and living expenses. In contradiction to Dr Goh’s evidence that he had asked Ms Melissa to consider mortgaging Berth, Ms Melissa’s evidence is that Dr Goh had never spoken to her about mortgaging Berth.

That being said, while I think it fair to rely on it (and have done so) in considering Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy’s involvement in and knowledge of the circumstances and intra-family communications surrounding the dealings with Seascape and Berth, I recognise that Mdm Koh and Dr Goh were not part of the group chat.

</div> I do not see any basis upon which the defendants were able to challenge the basis on which the adjustments had been made for 70 Ocean Drive. In any event, the sale of 70 Ocean Drive had occurred over two months after the 7 March 2019 valuation of 36 Cove Way. Mr Cheng explained that this was because he had been instructed to do a backdated valuation and that he would not have taken 70 Ocean Drive into account if he had been asked to do a valuation from the valuer’s point of view as at 7 March 2019.

Mr Ko was of the opinion that 94 Cove Drive is not a suitable comparable as it is next to a landscaped garden, and has highlighted that this makes a difference “in such a tangible manner that makes it very problematic to use 94 Cove Drive as a comparable” – as this is not just a boundary line where some plants have been placed, but “an entire plot of vacant land with trees”.

I do not think the evidence supports the defendants’ claim that Dr Goh was optimistic about his chances of winning his lawsuits and did not expect to have any creditors. Dr Goh had already lost Suit 1311 and was still dealing with Suit 686. He himself said that, as of early 2019, he was “overwhelmed by so many lawsuits” and “under a lot of stress”.

</div> Moreover, as I have found above, even before he sold 36 Cove Way to Mdm Koh, Dr Goh had already articulated and manifested an intention to dispose of his assets – see, for example, the Vultures Message, his purchase of Seascape and his transfer of monies to Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 While the defendants suggest that the buying out of 36 Cove Way was Mdm Koh’s attempt to protect herself and her mother-in-law in light of Dr Goh’s gambling addiction and their matrimonial troubles, I note that Dr Goh has not been consistent in his characterisation of their matrimonial difficulties. This is not to say that I disbelieve that Dr Goh had an addiction to gambling or that Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s marriage had been impacted by his addiction. However, as the plaintiff has rightly pointed out, Dr Goh’s addiction and his matrimonial problem are not mutually exclusive with the possibility that Dr Goh wished to defraud his creditors. In my view, the totality of the evidence establishes that Dr Goh had intended to dispose of his half-share in 36 Cove Way to put it out of reach of potential creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 To begin with, Dr Goh denied Mdm Koh’s claim that in early 2019, he had demanded money from her under the pretext of needing it for personal business and threatened to divorce her if she did not give him the money.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Essentially, we are faced with a situation where all other evidence flies in the face of Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s suggestion that Mdm Koh is the true lender of the loans to the yacht companies. It is not enough for Mdm Koh and Dr Goh to assert blandly that the accounts belied the truth; in the absence of supporting evidence, I find that the loans were more likely than not extended by Dr Goh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Further, it appears to me that this novation was made with the intent of defrauding Dr Goh’s creditors. It is inconsequential whether the suits were going well as of 2017. As early as 2016, Dr Goh had begun (as I have found above) the process of dissipating his assets. Given the untenability of Dr Goh’s claim that he was trying to correct the yacht companies’ accounts, it is more likely than not that his novation of the loans was done with the aim of defrauding creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Furthermore, Mdm Koh had only provided S$1 in exchange for the novation of the loans. Also, as mentioned above, since she had well been aware of Dr Goh’s intention to defraud creditors prior to the novation and given the flimsiness of the claim that she is the true lender, I am of the view that she had notice of Dr Goh’s intent to defraud his creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Similarly, even though Dr Goh and Mdm Koh claimed that he had transferred his shares in SYC to her as he was burdened by his ongoing lawsuits, there is no evidence to support this claim. During trial, Dr Goh began by calling SYC a mere “hobby business”, but went on to say just a few minutes afterwards that because the company had been managed by Mdm Koh, he was “not involved” or “even aware” of the loans made to SYC.

</div> On the face of his evidence, neither characterisation of SYC suggests that he would need to transfer his shares so as to focus on his lawsuits. This business was either not a core business for Dr Goh that would distract him from his legal concerns, or not even a business which he had a hand in managing, despite being a significant shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Also, as highlighted during Dr Goh’s examination, Dr Goh’s two reasons for the novation of loans and transfer of shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to correct the accounts and because he wanted to focus on his lawsuits) do not cohere with each other. If all he had wanted was to have Mdm Koh be responsible for running SYC so that he could focus on his lawsuits, then it would be sufficient for him to transfer the shares to her and not also to novate the loans. If the issue was that the accounts were wrong, he did not have to give up responsibility for running SYC for them to be amended.

</div> As such, the defendants’ position is that insofar as Mdm Koh has a joint interest in the OCBC 501 Account, this poses a hindrance to Mdm Wang’s claim against Berth and Seascape. To this, counsel for Mdm Wang says that this proposition is only limited to garnishee proceedings.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 With respect to counsel, I do not think that the defendants’ submission was the proposition being forwarded in the two cited authorities. Those authorities were concerned with the narrower issue of whether the court should allow joint bank accounts to be garnished. In any event, the position in Singapore law on garnishing joint accounts has not yet been settled. On one hand, these two cases take the position that joint accounts may be garnished if there is strong <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie</span> evidence that the money therein belongs to the judgment debtor, with Aedit Abdullah J commenting in <span class="font-italic">Timing 2020</span> (at [24]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To hold otherwise would permit debtors to insulate their assets by holding them in joint accounts, and would result in an arbitrary position where the recoverability of a judgment debt depended in large part on the manner in which the debtor had decided to organise his personal finances. Such a position would unduly undermine the position of judgment creditors, and would permit judgment debtors to, fortuitously or otherwise, frustrate the rulings of a court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 However, in <span class="font-italic">One Investment and Consultancy Ltd and another v Cham </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Meng (DBS Bank Ltd, </span>garnishee) [2016] 5 SLR 923 (“<span class="font-italic">One Investment</span>”), Kannan Ramesh JC (as he then was) took the opposing position that joint accounts cannot be garnished as “a bank has no visibility as to the respective contributions of the joint account holders” and is ill-suited to conduct a determination of parties’ respective contributions. The garnishing of joint accounts may also cause banks to incur operational and legal costs in notifying joint account owners and responding to their complaints, whereas the garnishee process is supposed to be fairly uncomplicated (at [16] and [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I make two observations on counsel’s application of these two cases. The first is to reiterate that the state of law on garnishing orders with respect to joint accounts is simply not relevant to the present case. This can be seen from how the court in <span class="font-italic">One Investment</span> has centred much of its reasoning around the nature and purpose of the garnishing process, such as the implications that garnishing of joint accounts would hold for banks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The second is that even in <span class="font-italic">Timing 2020</span>, the question of whether the account should be garnished is still ultimately premised on the question of whether the monies in the joint account belong to the judgment debtor. Similarly, <span class="font-italic">Timing 2021</span> concerns a garnishing application by the appellant with respect to two of the respondent’s accounts with Standard Chartered Bank, which were in joint name with the respondent’s wife (<span class="font-italic">Timing 2021</span> at [1]). The court held that the evidence did not suffice to establish on a balance of probabilities that all the monies in the joint accounts belonged beneficially to the respondent: at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Turning back to our present case, the evidence does not show that Mdm Koh had no beneficial interest in the monies in the joint account in the first place. She may not have stopped Dr Goh from using the monies in the OCBC 582 Account, but nothing suggests that she too could not access the monies. She, too, had contributed monies to the account. Moreover, as established earlier, she was also involved in the purchase of Berth and Seascape using the monies. I hence do not think the finding that the OCBC 582 Monies are jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh places any obstacles to the reliefs sought by Mdm Wang.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Severance of joint beneficial interest in Berth and Seascape</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Counsel for Mdm Wang submits that as Berth and Seascape were bought with monies jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, and given that Mdm Wang is seeking an order for the sale of these two properties, the Court should sever the joint tenancy in the properties and apportion 80% to Dr Goh and 20% to Mdm Koh.
