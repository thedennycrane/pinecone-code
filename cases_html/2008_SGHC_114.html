<p class="Judg-author" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Andrew Ang J:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       The plaintiff, WBG Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“WBG”), and the first defendant, Meridian Life International Pte Ltd (“Meridian Life”), are multi-level marketing (“MLM”) companies competing in the business of selling, <i>inter alia</i>, algae health products. WBG was established in 1997 and is now said to have an annual turnover of about $45m. Meridian Life is a relative newcomer established in 2004. In this suit, WBG alleges that the second defendant, Lim Jit Shyan (“Shyan”), and the third defendant, Tan Siong Woei (“Ivan”), both employees of Meridian Life, had spoken words that constituted slander and malicious falsehood and is seeking a substantial sum of $12m in special damages.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Facts</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2       Prior to joining Meridian Life, Shyan and Ivan were involved in the distribution of WBG’s star health products known as the Hunza range, which comprised, <i>inter alia</i>, Fibre Plus, Vitality Plus and Indinine Formula. Those products contained an alga called “Cryptomonodales” (hereinafter referred to as “CM”). The products had been distributed in Singapore since 1997 by WBG under licence from a Taiwanese manufacturer, a Professor Wang Shun Te (“Prof Wang”) and his company, International Chlorella Co Ltd. CM is actually a trade name owned by Prof Wang or his company. The scientific name of the alga is Chlorella Sorokiniana (“CS”), which is a sub-species within the Chlorella family of algae.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3       According to WBG’s marketing brochures at the material time, CM is an oval-shaped unicellular alga plant which reproduces itself by cell division from one to four or even 16 full-grown algae plants within 24 hours. This “life force”, when translated into the human body, helps to rejuvenate human cells. Indinine is a complex that is extracted from the nucleus of CM and its medicinal properties reputedly include enhancing tissue repair, detoxification at the cellular level, improvement of bowel functions and stimulation of the immune system.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       For many years, WBG trumpeted CM as the star ingredient and did not disclose to its consumers or distributors that CM was actually a trade name for CS. In fact, in its brochures, WBG extolled the health properties of CM and sought to distinguish CM as being of a “different breed” superior to Chlorella and Spirulina, two other kinds of algae products in the market. WBG’s distributors, including Shyan and Ivan, were also taught that Prof Wang was the only supplier of CM and that he supplied CM only to WBG. CM was thus exclusive to WBG.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5       Shyan and Ivan left WBG in late 2003. In July 2005, WBG lost the licence to distribute Prof Wang’s products and to use the trade name CM. This licence was subsequently granted by Prof Wang to Meridian Life. In November 2005, Shyan and Ivan were employed by Meridian Life and began to distribute Meridian Life’s algae health product “Crypto+” which was similarly marketed as containing the wonder ingredient CM. The distributors usually referred to CM by a shorter name “Crypto”. Around that time, Shyan and Ivan discovered that CM was actually a trade name and that CS was the scientific name of the alga.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6       WBG had anticipated the breakdown of its relationship with Prof Wang and, beginning from late 2004, it had updated its Hunza range to consist of, <i>inter alia</i>, two new products called Indinine3000 and Vplus ExV. These were new formulations and the packaging of the products now showed CS as the main ingredient. For example, Indinine3000, which was introduced in December 2004 as a product upgrade for Indinine, contains CS mixed with an algae-sourced organic DHA (also known as “Crypthecodinium Cohnii”). WBG had managed to obtain the CS from another Taiwanese manufacturer. Shyan and Ivan were aware that the new packaging showed CS as the main ingredient.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7       The alleged defamatory statements were made on two occasions at Meridian Life’s premises. WBG alleged that the first occasion was on 30 March 2006 when the following statements were allegedly made by Shyan and/or Ivan during a sales presentation to a Mr Bruce Cai Qing (“Bruce”) and his wife Mrs Doreen Soon Bee Yun (“Doreen”):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    The “no CS statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The products sold by WBG no longer contains Cryptomonodales (<i>ie</i>, Chlorella Sorokiniana).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    The “third party website statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If WBG was doing true business practices, WBG would not refer to a third party website for their products.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    The “misrepresentation statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">WBG labelling their products as containing Chlorella Sorokiniana amounted to a misrepresentation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    The “circuitous route statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">WBG had obtained Chlorella Sorokiniana from a Professor Wang Shun Te by way of a circuitous route from the United States of America.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    The “lack of transparency statement” – (attributed to Shyan)</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I had quit from WBG because I had to be true to my conscience, and I had joined WBG because WBG was very transparent in its business dealings and would produce black and white documents for clarification when so required.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)     The “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” – (attributed to Shyan)</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">WBG had changed the name of a product from Indinine to Indinine3000 to avoid being liable for misrepresentation. This was despite me (Lim Jit Shyan) knowing that Indinine is a trademark belonging to WBG.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">This group of statements will be collectively referred to as “the six main statements”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8       The second occasion was on 1 April 2006 when, according to WBG, the <i>same</i> six main statements were made again by Shyan and/or Ivan during a sales presentation to Bruce, a Ms Sharon Ong (“Sharon”) and a Mr Tan Chye Soon (“Tan”).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       In addition, WBG alleged that on this occasion, the following other statements were made by Shyan and/or Ivan:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    The “mixture statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The products sold by WBG is [<i>sic</i>] “no longer Crypto” and that “it must be a mixture of something else”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    The “change of name statement” –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The reason for WBG changing their product name from Indinine to Indinine3000 was because they no longer have the Crypto supply.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    A statement essentially the same as the “no CS statement” at [7] above –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The products sold by WBG does not [<i>sic</i>] contain Chlorella Sorokiniana.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">These three statements will be collectively referred to as “the three additional statements”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     WBG pleaded that all the statements contain the following meanings and innuendoes:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    The products sold by WBG do not contain CS at all.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    WBG had misrepresented that its products contain CS.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(c)    WBG had misrepresented its products generally.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    WBG was selling covertly obtained CS which was cultivated by Prof Wang.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(e)    WBG’s products do not live up to the expectations as stated in the third party website, and that is why WBG does not have on its own website, assertions similar to those on the third party website.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(f)     WBG was and continues to be dishonest in the conduct of its business and business practice.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(g)    WBG was and is not transparent in its business dealings.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     WBG further contended that all the statements amount to malicious falsehood. WBG argued that the references are false in that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    WBG’s products did and do at all times contain CS; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Shyan had not quit from WBG but was in fact terminated by WBG for failing to adhere to WBG’s code of conduct in that he had deliberately poached downlines from others.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">WBG further argued that the references were malicious in that Shyan and/or Ivan knew the falsity of the references but nevertheless made such references.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12     At this juncture, I set out the two occasions when the alleged defamatory statements were said to have been made. On the first occasion, on 30<sup> </sup> March 2006, Doreen was invited to Meridian Life’s premises by Shyan’s wife (then his girlfriend), Jaslyn, to find out more about Meridian Life’s product “Crypto+”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     Bruce accompanied Doreen to this sales presentation. Bruce has been an active distributor of WBG since August 2002. He is currently at the fourth out of seven levels in the hierarchy of distributors, with a downline of approximately 3,000 members. In MLM terminology, one’s downline refers to the entire downward chain of customers whose ultimate supply of products comes from that person. Doreen is also at the fourth level of the hierarchy but her involvement with WBG took a back seat after she had a child in late 2003.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14     At this first sales presentation, Bruce and Doreen were ushered into a presentation hall. They were seated around a table for a sales pitch by Shyan and Ivan. The alleged defamatory statements comprising the six main statements were made in the course of the sales pitch. Bruce and Doreen were then shown a video presentation which featured Prof Wang giving a talk to Meridian Life’s distributors on “Crypto+”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15     Bruce was startled to discover that Prof Wang was now supplying Meridian Life’s with the star ingredient, CM. Immediately after this sales presentation, Bruce’s testimony was that he met with a Dr George Lim (“George”) at WBG’s premises. George is the founder of WBG. Bruce told George about the sales presentation he had attended and informed him that Prof Wang was supplying Meridian Life with CM.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16     In swift response, George engaged the services of a private investigation team, comprising Sharon and Tan. The plan concocted by George was for Bruce to bring Sharon and Tan to attend a sales presentation by Meridian Life. Sharon was to pose as a sister of Bruce’s customer from WBG who had recovered from certain illnesses after taking WBG’s products.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17     At this second sales presentation a mere two days later on 1 April 2006, the private investigation team, as one would expect, brought a pin-hole camera with them. Interestingly, no video or aural evidence from the camera was tendered in court. Sharon’s testimony was that a customer service officer at the reception counter grew suspicious of her when she walked into Meridian Life’s premises. According to Bruce, Ivan then questioned him why they had brought along a pin-hole camera but eventually nothing came of it.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18     Bruce, Sharon and Tan were shown Meridian Life’s corporate video at a holding area. This was a different video from the earlier one shown to Bruce and Doreen. Bruce, Sharon and Tan were then brought to a table at the presentation hall for the sales pitch by Shyan and Ivan. Sharon’s cover story was that her sister was able to discontinue dialysis after taking WBG’s algae products and she wanted to know more about the difference between the algae products of the two companies. The alleged defamatory statements of 1 April 2006 were made during the course of this sales pitch.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19     Counsel for both parties are agreed that if Shyan and Ivan are found liable, the first defendant will be held vicariously liable as well. I now proceed first to examine the lack of traversal in the defence, a point raised by counsel for WBG, Mr Peter Gabriel.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Lack of traversal in defence</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20     Mr Gabriel submitted that Shyan and Ivan had, in their defence, traversed some but not all of WBG’s allegations. I have earlier set out these allegations in full ([7]–[9] above). A failure to traverse, he argued, amounts to an admission of the allegations of fact therein.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21     That must be right. Order 18 r 13 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) reads:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><b><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Admissions and denials (O. 18, r. 13)</font></span></b></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><b><span lang="EN-GB">13.</span></b> <span lang="EN-GB">—        (1) Subject to paragraph (4), any allegation of fact made by a party in his pleading is deemed to be admitted by the opposite party unless it is traversed by that party in his pleading or a joinder of issue under Rule 14 operates as a denial of it.</span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(2)     A traverse may be made either by a denial or by a statement of non-admission and either expressly or by necessary implication.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(3)     Subject to paragraph (4), every allegation of fact made in a statement of claim or counterclaim which the party on whom it is served does not intend to admit must be specifically traversed by him in his defence or defence to counterclaim, as the case may be; and a general denial of such allegations, or a general statement of non-admission of them, is not a sufficient traverse of them.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(4)    Any allegation that a party has suffered damage and any allegation as to the amount of damages is deemed to be traversed unless specifically admitted.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">It therefore becomes necessary to examine specifically what Shyan and Ivan had not traversed in their respective defences, although the exercise is somewhat tedious.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Shyan’s Defence</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22     In relation to the first sales presentation on 30 March 2006, Shyan denied making the six main statements, except for –</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the “third party website” statement (statement (b) at [7] above) as to which he raised the defence of fair comment; and</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    the “circuitous route statement” (statement (d) at [7] above) as to which he raised both the defences of fair comment and justification.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">He also denied the meanings and innuendoes of the statements as pleaded by WBG and further denied that the statements constitute malicious falsehood.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23     In relation to the second sales presentation on 1 April 2006, Shyan did not traverse any of WBG’s allegations that the alleged defamatory statements (six main statements and three additional statements) were made by him. Neither did he traverse the meanings and innuendoes of the statements. Shyan’s defence basically made no mention of the allegations against him concerning the second presentation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Ivan’s Defence</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24     Out of the six main statements, Ivan is implicated only for statements (a) to (d) (at [7] above) on both occasions.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25     In relation to the first presentation on 30 March 2006, Ivan did not traverse any of the allegations that the four statements were made by him. Neither did he traverse the meanings and innuendoes of those statements. Ivan’s defence made no mention whatsoever of the allegations against him concerning the first presentation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26     In relation to the second sales presentation on 1 April 2006, there was some initial confusion because Ivan’s defence was unclear as to whether it was traversing the three additional statements or the main statements. Counsel for the defendants, Mr Michael Loh, clarified that the defence was traversing the former. Accordingly, Ivan did not traverse any of the allegations that four of the main statements were made by him during the second presentation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27     Returning to the three additional statements, Ivan raised the defence of justification for the “mixture statement” (statement (a) at [9] above), the defence of justification and/or fair comment for the “change of name” statement (statement (b) at [9] above) but denied making the “no CS statement” (statement (a) at [7] above and statement (c) at [9] above). Ivan also denied the meanings and innuendoes of the statements as pleaded by WBG and further denied that the statements constitute malicious falsehood.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28     When questioned about the general lack of traversal in the defence, Mr Loh argued that there was a general <i>seriatim</i> clause as well as a traversal by necessary implication in accordance with O 18 r 12(2) of the Rules of Court.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29     In respect of traversal by necessary implication, Mr Loh referred to Shyan and Ivan’s reliance on the defence of Meridian Life, para 10 of which stated:</font></p>

Any remark or comment in this regard by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants servants or agents is true and justified and is fair comment.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30     The defence of Shyan and Ivan (at para 1) made reference to the defence of Meridian Life in this fashion:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31     I cannot accept Mr Loh’s argument in regard to the general <i>seriatim</i> clause or traversal by necessary implication. Publication is an essential element of the tort of defamation which must be specifically addressed in the defence. I quote from GP Selvam, <i>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007 Ed) (“the White Book”) at para 18/13/6:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Every allegation of fact must be specifically denied or specifically not admitted. … So far as concerns the allegations which are the gist of the action, the denial should be as precise as possible, <i>e.g</i>. “The defendant never spoke or published the said words or any of them”.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If publication and reference (ie identification of the plaintiff in the alleged defamatory act) are in issue, that fact must be clearly pleaded in the defence. The defence should specifically deny those allegations contained in the statement of claim that relate to publication and reference.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Para 29-29 of Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacob’s <i>Precedent of Pleadings</i>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 16th Ed, 2008) (“Bullen &amp; Leake”) is to the same effect.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33     The rationale behind requiring the defence to be specific in addressing the gist of the action is obvious.

<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">… to definite issues, and so diminish expense and delay, especially as regards the amount of testimony required on either side at the hearing. … This object is secured by requiring that each party in turn should fully admit or clearly deny every material allegation made against him.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">That is precisely why the White Book, at para 18/13/6, recommends that the general <i>seriatim</i> clause ought not be adopted in dealing with essential allegations.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     Further, the particular statement in Meridian Life’s defence relied upon by counsel ([29] above) was itself a general one and did not specifically deny publication of the six main statements or the three additional statements. Order 18 r 13 of the Rules of Court embodies the requirements of procedural justice to ensure that issues are clearly crystallised. I have carefully scrutinised the defence in this case but can see no way to hold that all the allegations as to publication had been traversed. The further argument run by Mr Loh that WBG had appeared to conflate or equate CM with CS in its pleadings does not in any way absolve the defendants of their duty to respond with precision in their defence and to fully protect their position even if WBG’s Statement of Claim was ambiguous. In any event, there were allegations made by WBG which did not involve CM or CS (<i>eg</i>, the “third party website statement” (statement (b) at [7] above)) which were not traversed fully.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     The consequence of the lack of traversal is that the allegations as to publication are deemed admitted; the defendants will not be able to adduce evidence on the issue because it is no longer in dispute: the White Book at para 18/13/1 citing <i>Borneo Housing Mortgage Finance Bhd v Personal Representatives of the Estate of Lee Lun Wah Maureen.</i></font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Whether the statements bear the defamatory meanings and innuendoes</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     A commonly used test whether a statement contains a defamatory meaning or innuendo is that applied by Lord Atkin in <i>Sim v Stretch</i> <nobr>[1936] 52 TLR 669</nobr> at 671:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">see <i>Workers’ Party v Tay Boon Too</i> <nobr>[1972-1974] SLR 621</nobr> at 628; Clerk &amp; Lindsell on <i>Torts</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006) (“Clerk &amp; Lindsell”) at para 23-28. Where the statements are targeted at a business, it is also pertinent to note that “words which tend to interfere with a person’s business are not as such defamatory, unless they tend to injure his reputation”: see Gatley on <i>Libel and Slander</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) (“Gatley”) at para 2.9. Applying this test, I accept that all the alleged statements pleaded by WBG (at [7] and [9] above) are defamatory, except for: (i) the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above); (ii) the “mixture statement” (statement (a) at [9] above); and (iii) the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     Regardless of whether they were true or false, I do not see how those three statements bear any of the meanings and innuendoes pleaded (at [10] above). The general sting of all the alleged defamatory statements pleaded by WBG is that WBG’s products did not contain CS and that WBG engaged in unsavoury business practices. “The change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) is at worst neutral and could perhaps even be said to present WBG in a good light since WBG did the responsible thing of changing the name of its product to <i>avoid</i> misleading the public. It did not accuse WBG of <i>actively</i> misrepresenting its products or infringing the trademark of others. To an ordinary person, a statement that a seller has to change the name of his products when a key ingredient has been changed would not be remarkable. Neither does it impute the absence or presence of any ingredient.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44     In relation to “the mixture statement” (statement (a) at [9] above) and “the change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above), I disagree that the reference to the absence of “Crypto” in those statements meant that WBG’s products did not contain CS or that WBG engaged in unsavoury business practices. It is common ground between Bruce, Ivan and Shyan that the term “Crypto” was used to refer to CM when they conducted sales presentations. (That perhaps explains why Meridian Life named its product “Crypto+” to ride on the good name of “Crypto”.) Before WBG lost its license with Prof Wang, it had aggressively touted “Crypto” (or CM) as a unique substance in itself. Hence, any statement that WBG’s products did not contain “Crypto” would only impute that WBG’s products did not contain CM. The parties are agreed that defamation would not lie for any statement that WBG’s products no longer contain “Crypto”.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45     I also observe that WBG did not place any weight on the three statements identified above (at [42]) during the course of the proceedings and focused their case on statements (a) to (e) at [7] above.

<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Outstanding issues on publication and defences</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46     For Shyan, the outstanding issues concerning the six main statements allegedly made during the first sales presentation of 30 March 2006, are:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    Whether he made the “no CS statement” (statement (a) at [7] above);</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(b)    Whether the defence of fair comment is made out for the “third party website statement” (statement (b) at [7] above);</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     For Ivan, the outstanding issue iswhether he made the “no CS statement” (statement (c) at [9] above) during the second sales presentation on 1 April 2006.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">First sales presentation of 30 March 2006</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Whether Shyan made statements (a), (c) and (e) at [7] above</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48     It will have been noted at [37] above that Shyan is deemed to have admitted to making statements (a), (c) and (e) (at [7] above), <i>inter alia</i>, during the second sales presentation on 1 April 2006. For that reason, whether he made those statements during the <i>first</i> sales presentation is not of critical importance except to determine the number of occasions the utterances were made. Furthermore, the audience to which the defamatory statements were made during the first sales presentation was also a small group. Nonetheless, I shall examine this issue for completeness.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49     WBG’s case for the first sales presentation rests primarily on the testimony of Bruce and Doreen. I found Doreen to be an unhelpful witness on the stand. She was unable to recall many of the events that had occurred during that presentation. Under cross-examination, she revealed that she did not pay much attention to the sales presentation; she was carrying on another conversation and catching up with her friend, Jaslyn, and other old friends who were present at that presentation. She admitted that she left her husband Bruce to speak with Shyan and Ivan. She further admitted that in her own affidavit of evidence-in-chief she had agreed with what her husband had said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief because whatever her husband said “<i>must</i>” be true. When asked in re-examination to clarify what she herself remembered Shyan and Ivan to have actually said, all she could say (at Notes of Evidence, p 104) was that Shyan and Ivan had said “WBG no longer using [<i>sic</i>] Cryptomonodales”. Her oral evidence made it amply clear that it would be unsafe to rely on her affidavit of evidence-in-chief.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">50     This leaves Bruce as WBG’s key witness for the first presentation. After reviewing Bruce’s testimony, I am satisfied that the allegations that Shyan had made statements (a) and (c) (at [7] above) are unsubstantiated assertions. The only allegation that is made out is the “lack of transparency statement” (statement (e) at [7] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">51     I am satisfied from the evidence that during a typical one-hour long sales presentation by Meridian Life where the customer’s attention span was limited, the focus would be on extolling the virtues of one’s own product extensively and not on putting down the competitor. I accept that it is not common for Ivan and Shyan to venture into the competitor’s product range or the precise scientific ingredients involved. Bruce himself acknowledged (at Notes of Evidence, pp 97–98) that the focus of the first sales presentation was on actively extolling the virtues of Meridian Life’s “Crypto+” and not on disparaging competing products.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">52     Bruce also gave evidence that immediately after the first sales presentation he went back to George and related to George that Shyan and Ivan had said that WBG’s products did not contain CM any more. That was all he told George. If, as Bruce alleged, not one but six defamatory statements had been made during that sales presentation, one would have expected Bruce to have mentioned at least some of those statements to George.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">53     That Bruce’s recollection of the first presentation was unreliable is further shown by his inconsistent evidence whether it was Shyan or Ivan who had made statements (a), (c) and (d) (at [7] above) during the first sales presentation. During cross-examination, Bruce stated (at Notes of Evidence, p 60) that it was Ivan who had made the statements, but he later sought to resile. Bruce’s initial answer – that it was Ivan who made the alleged defamatory statements – is consistent with Shyan and Ivan’s testimony that Ivan was the main presenter during the first presentation. A further reason for doubt was that Bruce’s recollection of the six main statements alleged to have been uttered during the first sales presentation was word for word the same as those uttered during the second sales presentation.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">54     After considering the evidence carefully, the only statement out of the three statements in issue (statements (a), (c) and (e) at [7]) above), which I am satisfied Shyan made, is the “lack of transparency” statement (statement (e) at [7] above). That statement, in its entirety, reads:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">I had quit from WBG because I had to be true to my conscience, and that I had joined WBG because WBG was very transparent in its business dealings and would produce black and white documents for clarification when so required.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Shyan stated (at para 40):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">As for my statement that I quit arising from my conscience, it was my view of how I wanted to do my business. The fact that they had hidden from me that CM was actually the tradename of CS during my time with them shows how the Plaintiffs did their business.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">He accepted during cross-examination that that paragraph was an implicit admission that he had indeed made the lack of transparency statement.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">55     I turn next to examine the defences pleaded by Shyan: (i) fair comment for the “third party website statement” (statement (b) at [7] above); and (ii) justification and fair comment for the “circuitous route statement” (statement (d) at [7] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Fair comment for the “third party website statement”</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">56     The “third party website statement” in its entirety reads:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If WBG was doing true business practices, WBG would not refer to a third party website for their products.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">During cross-examination, Shyan admitted that he had shown Bruce a third party website during the presentation. There was some disagreement over whether that website was &lt;<span lang="EN-GB">http://www.indinine.biz&gt;</span> or &lt;<span lang="EN-GB">http://www.tigerstone.biz&gt;</span>. Interestingly, the print-outs from the website</font> &lt;<span lang="EN-GB">http://www.tigerstone.biz&gt;</span><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"> as late as October 2006 displayed WBG’s Hunza range of products and the corresponding WBG sales brochures on the same. WBG had already lost the license to distribute Prof Wang’s products and to use the trade name CM since July 2005.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">57     Be that as it may, one of the elements of fair comment is that the comment must be based on fact: <i>Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 760</nobr>; <i>Chen Cheng v Central Christian Church</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 94</nobr>. Mr Loh argued that WBG knew full well that its trademarks were being used on those websites. Whilst there may well be strong suspicion of a connection between WBG and those websites, the evidence presented before me did not bear out the allegation that WBG <i>itself</i> had been referring to any of those websites. The print-outs from WBG’s website and brochures at the material time did not contain the links to third party websites. MLM distributors are free to set up their own websites advertising their products and these websites are not necessarily endorsed or supervised by the parent company. Accordingly, that part of the statement alluding to WBG referring to a third party website was not based on fact. Fair comment therefore fails.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span class="Judg-Heading-2Char"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Justification and fair comment for the “circuitous route statement”</font></em></strong></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">58     The “circuitous route statement” in its entirety reads:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">WBG had obtained Chlorella Sorokiniana from a Professor Wang Shun Te by way of a circuitous route from the United States of America.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The defence of justification fails since the statement was untrue; WBG had ceased obtaining CS from Prof Wang but from another Taiwanese manufacturer , Far East Bio-Tec Co Ltd (“Febico”). The defence of fair comment also fails as the impugned statement was one of fact and not comment.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Second sales presentation of 1 April 2006</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">59     The context of the second sales presentation was strikingly different from the first. Whilst the first presentation might be described as a typical MLM sales presentation, the second presentation involved a covert sting operation set up by WBG to entrap Meridian Life. Sharon testified that she was employed by WBG for the specific task of recording remarks, if any, made by Meridian Life’s employees that WBG’s Indinine Formula and Vitality Plus did not contain CS. A thorough review of all the evidence before me shows that the second sales presentation was deliberately designed to ensnare Meridian Life where Ivan and Shyan were subject to relentless questioning by Sharon. Her job as <i>agent provocateur</i> was to precipitate the making of defamatory remarks by persistently asking Shyan and Ivan suggestive questions.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">60     Interestingly, the first time Sharon heard of the term Cryptomonodales was during the second sales presentation itself. This meant that WBG’s instructions to her were specifically targeted at capturing statements about the lack of CS in WBG’s products. WBG knew full well what they needed to pin Meridian Life down.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">61     It will be recalled that Sharon’s colleague, Tan, had brought along a pin-hole camera to Meridian Life’s premises. When asked why no such recording was produced in court, all Sharon could say was that the recording was “somewhat terminated” by her colleague. Quite naturally, there was some doubt whether it had indeed been “terminated” and whether it contained relevant evidence. However, given the lack of traversal by Shyan and Ivan, the failure to produce the recording was not of critical importance.</font></span></p>

He testified that Sharon kept asking him whether WBG’s products were “fake” and his reply was that WBG’s products no longer had “Crypto” but Meridian Life’s product did. He stressed that his emphasis was always on “Crypto”. This is consistent with Sharon’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief where she said that Ivan had tried not to talk about WBG. After considering the evidence regarding the second sales presentation carefully, I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that Ivan made the “no CS statement” (statement (c) at [9] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Summary on defamation</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">65     Before we proceed to the issue of malicious falsehood, it may be useful to summarise my findings on defamation. In this connection, WBG does not have to prove special damage in order to successfully establish an action in slander. Section 5 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) provides that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5.      In an action for slander in respect of words calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The word “calculated” in s 5 is used in s 6 of the same Act and has been interpreted to mean “likely to produce the result”: <i>DHKW Marketing v Nature’s Farm Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 400</nobr>; see also Gatley at para 4.16 and Clerk &amp; Lindsell at para 24-16, citing <i>IBM v Web-sphere Ltd</i> <nobr>[2004] FSR 39</nobr> to similar effect. Since this is an action for slander in respect of words that are likely to disparage WBG in its trade or business, it is unnecessary to prove special damage in establishing liability.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">66     Accordingly, having established the requisite elements of slander in the foregoing discussion, I find Shyan liable in defamation for making the following statements during the first sales presentation of 30 March 2006:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Falsity of the statements</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">69     Having reviewed the evidence, I find that all the statements at [7] and [9] above are false, save for the “lack of transparency statement” (statement (e) at [7] above) and the “mixture statement” (statement (a) at [9] above). I should perhaps elaborate on this finding of falsity with regard to the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">70     Those two statements were statements concerning WBG’s renaming of its Hunza range of products around the time when WBG lost its license with Prof Wang, <i>eg</i>, Indinine was renamed to Indinine3000 in December 2004. During cross-examination of Mr Andrew Ngai, the marketing director of WBG, Mr Loh tried to pin the reason for the renaming to the fact that WBG had lost the right to use the word “CM” on its packaging and wanted to avoid being liable for misrepresentation. However, Mr Ngai flatly denied that and explained that the renaming was to inform the consumer that the new products contain improved formulations and that the renaming was part of a process of product upgrading and development that was already ongoing before WBG lost its license with Prof Wang. I accept Mr Ngai’s answer and I find that the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above) are false.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">71     I now turn to discuss the statements which I find to be true or, to be more precise, which the plaintiff has failed to satisfy me to be false. With regard to the “mixture statement” (statement (a) at [9] above), as stated at [6] above, WBG’s new products do indeed contain a mixture of CS and other ingredients. As for the “lack of transparency statement” (statement (e) at [7] above), it will be recalled that WBG never once revealed to its distributors or customers that CM was actually a trade name for CS. Bruce, who is actively involved in WBG, testified that he only discovered this fact for himself while surfing the Internet. WBG jealously guarded the actual scientific ingredient, CS, from the public domain and, through extensive marketing, perpetuated the myth that CM was an ingredient unique to them. WBG trained all their distributors, including Bruce, Ivan and Shyan, to believe that CM was the fruit of intensive research by Prof Wang and that Prof Wang was the only manufacturer of CM. Mr Loh further submitted that the sales brochures of WBG had misleadingly marketed CM as being different and separate from Chlorella, when in fact CM is a sub-species within the Chlorella family (see [4] above). It is clear to me that the lack of transparency is evident from the way WBG actively mystified the identity of its star ingredient.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Malice</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">72     Whilst I do not think that Ivan and Shyan acted with the “dominant intent” of injuring WBG, malice may be made out if there was a reckless disregard of the true facts: <i>Maidstone Pte Ltd v Takenaka Corp</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 772</nobr> (“<i>Maidstone</i>”), citing <i>Horrocks v Lowe</i> [1975] AC 135; see also Gatley at para 20.7, citing <i>Spring v Guardian Assurance plc</i> [1993] 2 All ER 273 and <i>Kaye v Robertson</i> <nobr>[1991] FSR 62</nobr> at 67. Yong CJ in <i>Maidstone</i> also went on to state (at 789):</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">A defendant is not reckless, for the purposes of proving malice, if he did so believing it was true, even if he was careless, impulsive or irrational in coming to that belief. The law does not require him to be logical. In order for him to be held to be reckless, he must be shown to have not cared or considered if the statement was true.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Although the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of Shyan and Ivan suggested that they had honestly believed that WBG’s products no longer contained CS, the evidence they gave on the stand about their frame of mind at the material time was that they did not know how WBG had obtained its supply of CS after it lost its license with Prof Wang. If so, it cannot be said that they believed in the truth of the statements uttered, which concerns the <i>absence</i> of CS in WBG’s products. The evidence before me showed no attempt by Shyan and Ivan to consider, substantiate or validate the truth of the statements before they were uttered. I therefore find that the utterances were made in reckless disregard as to whether they were true.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Summary on malicious falsehood</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">73     Except for the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above), I am satisfied that special damage need not be proved by WBG since s 6(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act is satisfied, <i>viz</i>, the remaining statements were likely to produce pecuniary damage to WBG in respect of its business carried on at the time of publication.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">74     As I alluded to at [43] above, the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above) are at worst neutral statements and I cannot see how they were likely to produce pecuniary damage to WBG. Therefore in order to succeed in malicious falsehood with respect to those two statements, WBG has to prove special damage at common law.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">75     Accordingly, I now have to establish whether the special damage as pleaded by WBG has been proven for the sole purpose of determining whether liability in malicious falsehood is made out in respect of the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">76     In this connection, WBG claimed $12m in special damage and adduced evidence of its accounts through the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of its finance manager, Ms Julie Goh.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">77     The evidence Julie Goh provided was nothing more than the total value of sales to networkers for 2005 and for 2006. The difference between the total value of sales for the two years represented the loss in gross revenue for 2006, which was about $2m. She then multiplied that figure by four to obtain the projected amount of damages of $8m that would be suffered over four years on the basis it would take that period of time to rebuild lost confidence in the WBG brand. It was immediately apparent that whilst WBG sought $12m in damages, the evidence it produced could only support a claim for $8m at best.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">78     Whilst it was not pleaded as such, the method of calculation adopted by WBG can be considered as a claim for $2m for actual loss of profits suffered in 2006 and $6m for general loss of custom due to the acts of the defendants. That computation effectively attributed WBG’s loss of gross revenue for 2006 entirely to the defendants, but the accounts included products and courses that were completely unrelated to the Hunza product range.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">79     Even if the earlier $2m reduction in gross revenue was in relation to the Hunza product range, it was only a reduction in turnover. No attempt was made to show what the loss of profit was. (For the sake of completeness, even if WBG had hitherto been loss-making, it would still be necessary to show to what extent the defendant’s conduct had exacerbated WBG’s losses.) Besides, I am not persuaded from the circumstances of this case that “such loss was caused in fact by the defendants’ wrong, in the sense that but for the defendants’ act the loss would not have occurred”: Gatley at para 5.6; see also Clerk &amp; Lindsell at para 23-237.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">80     A critical factor I considered in assessing whether any such loss was <i>caused</i> by the defendants was that it could not be shown that Shyan and Ivan had repeated the defamatory statements beyond the confines of the two presentations of 30 March and 1 April 2006. There was no evidence at all that Shyan and Ivan had circulated those statements. Certainly the offending statements were not carried in the media or circulated in brochures. Whilst it is not inconceivable that there might have been other presentations, it is significant that WBG failed to produce any evidence of such.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">81     Further, Julie Goh conceded on cross-examination that any loss of custom might well be attributable to WBG’s inability to market their products as successfully as before without the star ingredient CM which they had so assiduously promoted in the past. Moreover, Meridian Life’s new claim to fame as a result of their acquisition of that same ingredient would have added to WBG’s woes. Julie Goh also admitted on the stand that it was probable that networkers bought less because they did not like the new products, <i>eg</i>, Indinine3000, released in December 2004. In other words, WBG could have lost business due to legitimate competition by Meridian Life or other competitors.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">82     In view of the unreliability of the evidence tendered, I see no ground to find that the special damage as pleaded by WBG has been proven. The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that liability in malicious falsehood in respect of the “change of name to avoid misrepresentation statement” (statement (f) at [7] above) and the “change of name statement” (statement (b) at [9] above) is not made out.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">83     I now summarise my findings on malicious falsehood. In relation to the first sales presentation, I find Shyan liable in malicious falsehood for making the “third party website statement” (statement (b) at [7] above) and the “circuitous route statement” (statement (d) at [7] above). In relation to the same sales presentation, I find Ivan liable in malicious falsehood for making:</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    the “circuitous route statement” (statement (d) at [7] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">84     For the second sales presentation, I find Shyan liable in malicious falsehood for making:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the “no CS statement” (statement (a) at [7] and statement (c) at [9] above);</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(d)    the “circuitous route statement” (statement (d) at [7] above).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">85     With regard to the same sales presentation, I find Ivan liable in malicious falsehood for making:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(a)    the “third party website statement” (statement (b) at [7] above);</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">As agreed, the first defendant is vicariously liable for the malicious falsehood uttered by Shyan and Ivan respectively.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times"><span class="Judg-Heading-1Char"><span lang="EN-GB">Conclusion</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">     </span></font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">86     At the commencement of the trial, I informed counsel that if I was satisfied that substantial damages ought to be awarded, I would bifurcate the issue of liability from that of quantum and order damages to be assessed. In this regard, Gatley states at para 20.13:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Where the words fall within the statute [<i>ie</i>, s 3(1) of the UK Defamation Act 1952 which is in <i>pari materia</i> with s 6(1) of our Act] the claimant may recover damages representing the loss which he is likely to suffer as the direct and natural consequence of the falsehood.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">In view of my finding that WBG has successfully invoked s 6(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act for certain statements constituting malicious falsehood (see [72] above), the existence of pecuniary loss must be inferred [see <i>McGregor</i> <i>on Damages</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2003) at para 40-016] and I am unable to award purely nominal damages. WBG is also entitled to general damages for its successful action in defamation in light of my findings at [66] to [67] above.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">87     For the foregoing reasons, I give judgment for the plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">88     In view of the course the trial has taken and, in particular, the concluded testimony of Julie Goh and my familiarity with the matter, I shall undertake the assessment of damages on a date to be fixed by the Registrar. Costs are reserved until after assessment.</font></span></p>
