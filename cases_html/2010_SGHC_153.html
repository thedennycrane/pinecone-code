<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Chee Jok Heng Stephanie
                    (“Dr Chee”) claims in this action the repayment of two sums
                    of $45,000 and $682,000 respectively from the defendant Chang Yue Shoon
                    (“Mr Chang”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Dr Chee’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Dr Chee was introduced to Mr Chang
                    sometime before March 2006 by his then business associate one Dr Mel Gill.
                    According to Dr Chee, Mr Chang was described to her as a
                    “lawyer specialising in criminal matters”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the second quarter of 2006, Dr Chee
                    faced accusations of criminal conduct in connection with her role as a
                    consultant with the charity Parkway Healthcare Foundation and its associated
                    Senior Citizens' Health Care Centres.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In or about March 2006, Dr Chee contacted
                    Mr Chang seeking legal advice concerning the accusations against her. She
                    stated that at a meeting between them shortly after, Mr Chang represented
                    to her that he was a criminal lawyer. Again, according to Dr Chee, he said
                    he was a good friend and close collaborator with one Peter Low, a lawyer, and
                    for a monthly fee of $15,000 he offered to provide her with legal advice
                    “together with Peter Low”. Dr Chee agreed to this
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In March 2006, Mr Chang corresponded with
                    Dr Chee in connection with her sole proprietorship, Wilcare Consulting
                    Group (“Wilcare”). While providing his <em>curriculum vitae</em> to Dr Chee in this context, he said that
                    he “read law with the University of London” without mentioning
                    that he did not graduate from this course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Dr Chee attested that in several
                    interactions with her and her daughters between March 2006 and September 2009,
                    Mr Chang had consistently held himself out as a lawyer doing professional
                    legal work with Peter Low for Dr Chee. Her second and youngest daughters,
                    Marie Bernadette Paul and Sharon Lourdes Paul respectively, also testified that
                    he had held himself out as a lawyer. According to Dr Chee’s evidence
                    he maintained this impression throughout the course of her criminal charges and
                    eventual trial in late 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In May, June and July 2006 respectively,
                    Dr Chee made three payments of $15,000 (a total of $45,000) to
                    Mr Chang. The first two were by personal cheques drawn on
                    Dr Chee’s account and the third was by a cheque drawn on
                    Wilcare’s account and described in an accompanying letter dated
                    13 July 2006 with Wilcare’s letterhead as “payment for your
                    consultancy services rendered to [Wilcare]”. Dr Chee’s
                    evidence was that these three payments were for Mr Chang’s legal
                    services, with the third described otherwise on Mr Chang’s own
                    instructions. Through Mr Chang, Dr Chee formally engaged Peter Low as
                    counsel in August 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In August 2006 Dr Chee, allegedly following
                    Mr Chang’s instructions, closed Wilcare and continued its business in
                    the same premises under Action Research Academy Pte Ltd (“ARA”)
                    with herself as director and Mr Chang as sole shareholder. Her evidence was
                    that Mr Chang had received payments and reimbursement for expenses from ARA
                    without performing work of a substantial nature for the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In mid-2007, Dr Chee sold a property at 985
                    Bukit Timah Road #05-11, Maplewoods, Singapore 589627 (“the Maplewoods
                    property”). After completion of the sale, she collected the net proceeds
                    of $856,555.29 on 10 September 2007. According to Dr Chee,
                    Mr Chang told her that she should not retain the proceeds in her bank
                    account as they were liable to be seized by the Commercial Affairs Department
                    (“CAD”) in connection with criminal investigations against her.
                    Dr Chee’s evidence stated that Mr Chang then proposed to hold
                    the proceeds on trust for her to be returned once her criminal case had been
                    resolved. Dr Chee’s account of events concluded that after deducting
                    expenses for herself and her family, she agreed to have Mr Chang hold
                    $682,000 for her on trust as he suggested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 September 2007, Dr Chee gave a
                    cheque for $682,000 to Mr Chang. Dr Chee stated that on
                    Mr Chang’s suggestion, the cheque was photocopied and the following
                    words were written by Dr Chee on the document containing the copy of the
                    cheque, “Return of friendly loan – interest free.”
                    Mr Chang allegedly explained that this was a simple way to explain the
                    payment. Both parties signed below these words. Mr Chang allegedly kept the
                    original of this document while Dr Chee kept a copy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>, Dr Chee is now claiming restitution of the sum of
                    $45,000 paid to Mr Chang from May to July 2006 and the sum of $682,000 paid
                    to Mr Chang on 13 September 2007. Her claim is essentially founded on
                    fraud. In the case of the $45,000, this seems more specifically to be a claim to
                    rescind a contract for Mr Chang’s services that she was induced to
                    enter by his fraudulent misrepresentation that he was a criminal lawyer. In the
                    case of the $682,000, the claim seems to be for recovery of money paid to
                    Mr Chang due to his fraudulent advice that the CAD might otherwise seize
                    the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mr Chang’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Chang’s defence stated that he
                    was never introduced to Dr Chee as any kind of lawyer, nor did he ever
                    represent to Dr Chee that he was a lawyer. While he had previously
                    undergone some legal education (though without obtaining a degree) and had some
                    working experience as an articled clerk, he denied ever having told Dr Chee
                    or her daughters either expressly or by implication that he was a lawyer or had
                    any specialisation in criminal matters. His evidence was that Dr Chee
                    formed her impression that he was knowledgeable in criminal law entirely of her
                    own accord, possibly through overhearing his conversations with friends on
                    matters of legal procedure. He conceded that he did inform Dr Chee in an
                    email that he had “read law with the University of London”, but
                    stated that the focus of that email was on his other business-related
                    experience. While he agreed that he introduced Dr Chee to Peter Low, he
                    stated that he only agreed to help Dr Chee with her legal matters to the
                    extent of collating documents and other sundry tasks in exchange for a reduction
                    of Peter Low’s legal fees as Dr Chee was in financial difficulties.
                    He testified that he did this for Dr Chee “as a
                    friend”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Concerning the $45,000 paid to him from May to
                    July 2006, Mr Chang stated that these were monthly fees paid to him in his
                    role as a business consultant for Wilcare which he took up in May 2006 after
                    receiving an invitation to do so by Dr Chee in April 2006. He explained
                    that she had intended to have him develop the business in anticipation of her
                    eventual departure from the Parkway Healthcare Foundation. In this light, he
                    denied that he instructed Dr Chee to describe Wilcare’s payment of
                    $15,000 to him in July 2006 as a consultancy fee, stating that the letter
                    covering that payment should be taken at face value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Mr Chang also denied that he had
                    instructed Dr Chee to discontinue Wilcare, carry on business under ARA or
                    transfer the shareholding of ARA to himself. He stated that all this was done in
                    August 2006 on the initiative of Dr Chee, who wanted him to be the sole
                    shareholder for ARA as a mere nominee. Mr Chang stated that he worked for
                    ARA as a business consultant and in this role he received reimbursement for
                    expenses and was entitled to monthly consultancy fees of $15,000 though these
                    were not paid between August 2006 and August 2007. Instead he was paid by ARA on
                    an <em>ad hoc</em> basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Chang did not dispute that
                    Dr Chee gave a cheque for $682,000 to him on 13 September 2007 which was
                    part of the proceeds of sale from the Maplewoods property. However, he denied
                    ever telling Dr Chee that the CAD might seize her proceeds of sale or that
                    he ever instructed her to write “Return of friendly loan – interest
                    free” on the photocopy of the cheque. Indeed, he claimed that at the time
                    he signed the photocopy there were no such words thereon. He did not produce any
                    original or copy of this document. His evidence was that after having been
                    unpaid for some time he gave notice of his resignation from ARA. To persuade him
                    not to leave the company, Dr Chee decided to have him hold the sum of
                    $682,000, of which part would be used to settle his outstanding and future
                    consultancy fees and part would be held on trust for her to be applied on her
                    instructions. Mr Chang stated that between September 2007 and December
                    2008, the $682,000 was fully accounted for in the following ways:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mr Chang concluded his account of events
                    by stating that in December 2008, he had met with Dr Chee and they
                    agreed that the balance from the $682,000 (<em>ie</em>,
                    $116,215) should be kept by Mr Chang in settlement of his outstanding
                    consultancy fees from September 2007 to December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     However, Mr Chang clarified in his
                    testimony that there was an error in that the two entries for the $80,000 paid
                    in (a)(i) and (b) referred to in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above
                    were actually in respect of a single payment of $80,000 into ARA’s
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is settled law that a contract can be
                    rescinded if a contractor was induced to enter it by fraudulent
                    misrepresentation: see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Jurong Town Corp v Wishing Star Ltd</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 283 and <em>Newbigging v Adam</em>
                    (1887) 34 Ch D 582 at 592 per Bowen LJ. It is also established
                    that where money is paid to a person wrongfully (as in a case of fraud or
                    bribery) the sum can be recovered as money had and received: <em>Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Thahir Kartika Ratna and others and another
                        matter</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 638.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Fraud is established when “a false
                    representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth,
                    or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false”: <em>Derry v Peek</em> (1889) 14 App Cas 337 per Lord
                    Herschell at 374, followed in <em>Blue Nile Co Ltd v Emery
                        Customs Brokers (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 396 at [9]
                    by Chan Sek Keong J.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I am convinced that Mr Chang knowingly
                    made false representations to Dr Chee that he was a criminal lawyer. In an
                    email to him on 23 March 2006, Dr Chee asked Mr Chang, “Do
                    you have a short cv of yourself, eg. NRIC, age, and some lines on your working
                    experience, qualification (<em>ie</em>, LLB) so that I can
                    have it in my record for reference?” The fact that Dr Chee clearly
                    expected Mr Chang to state an LLB qualification strongly suggests that
                    Mr Chang had explicitly told her he was a lawyer before that date. When he
                    replied to this email, he told her he had “read law with the University
                    of London” without disclosing that he did not graduate with a degree. In
                    so doing, he clearly suggested that he was a law graduate. To me, this was part
                    of his overall deception notwithstanding that his email was sent in the context
                    of his providing a curriculum vitae for his involvement in Wilcare’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I also find that he actively maintained his
                    pretence over time. I accept the evidence that in 2008 he also told
                    Dr Chee’s daughters that he was a lawyer. While 2008 was some time
                    after his first meetings with Dr Chee in 2006, I believe that his words
                    then were a continuation of the false impression that he had created in
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In addition, in a conversation with
                    Dr Chee on 25 August 2009 which was tape-recorded by Dr Chee, the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Here, Mr Chang stated that his role was to “anchor the
                    ship” in Dr Chee’s criminal matter. I would add that
                    Dr Chee explained that it was Mr Chang who had advised her that there
                    was no need to obtain permission from another person before tape-recording a
                    conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although the above conversations were recorded
                    in 2009, I am also of the view that they were a continuation of the false
                    impression that Mr Chang had created in 2006. In my view,
                    Mr Chang’s course of conduct from 2006 to 2009 was calculated to
                    generate and sustain the false impression that he was a lawyer providing
                    Dr Chee indispensible professional services in relation to accusations of a
                    criminal nature against her. I do not accept Mr Chang’s defence that
                    he never said or implied any such thing. While there is still a gap in the
                    account before the court as to how and when Dr Chee realised that
                    Mr Chang had lied to her about being a lawyer, this does not preclude me
                    from finding Mr Chang fraudulent in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I accept Dr Chee’s evidence that
                    she was desperate for legal advice relating to the criminal accusations against
                    her at that time. The effect of Mr Chang’s fraudulent representation
                    of himself as a lawyer, especially a criminal lawyer, was to induce Dr Chee
                    to contract with him for his legal advice in March 2006 for a fee of $15,000 a
                    month which she paid for three months from May to July 2006 for a total of
                    $45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I am also satisfied that in September 2007,
                    Mr Chang falsely told Dr Chee that her proceeds from the sale of the
                    Maplewoods property were liable to be seized by the CAD. He made this statement
                    to convince Dr Chee to have him hold all or part of the sale proceeds from
                    the Maplewoods property. I conclude that Dr Chee believed
                    Mr Chang’s fraudulent statement that the CAD might seize the proceeds
                    of sale from the Maplewoods property just as she had trusted him on previous
                    occasions. I also do not believe Mr Chang’s evidence that the words
                    “Return of friendly loan – interest free” on the photocopy
                    of the cheque were not written at his suggestion. The words were calculated to
                    give an investigator the false impression that he was entitled to the money. I
                    find that Mr Chang instructed her to write those words as part of his
                    overall deception concerning this money to give the impression that she was
                    repaying a loan to him. I do not believe Mr Chang’s defence that he
                    never made any such representation, especially in the light of his reaction when
                    confronted with his statement by Dr Chee in a tape-recorded conversation on
                    25 August 2009:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">To me, this seemed not to be the reaction of an offended man falsely
                    accused, but one with a guilty conscience who was afraid of the consequences of
                    his action. Not once during the conversation did he suggest that Dr Chee
                    had paid the money to him of her own volition. The fact that Dr Chee
                    mentioned that she was prepared to take back her words does not suggest an
                    untruth from her but was rather her response to a man who was getting more and
                    more agitated, causing her to decide to back off thus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I find that Dr Chee believed sincerely in
                    Mr Chang’s status as a lawyer and in his indispensible role in her
                    legal advice and criminal defence (as seen above in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). This was due in large part to his false statements and
                    conduct. In addition, she regarded him as a key business partner and personal
                    guide, describing him in an email sent on 21 May 2007 as having
                    “marketing and visionary capability and high emotional intelligence, to
                    help complement me” in addition to being “my Saviour and best role
                    model”. Email between them from 12 July 2006 and 5 May 2007
                    shows that over this period Mr Chang assumed a dominant position in their
                    relationship, with Dr Chee apologising profusely to him for perceived
                    slights or wrongdoings with strongly self-deprecating language. Her testimony,
                    which I believe, is that she was afraid that he would cease his work on her
                    criminal case with disastrous consequences for herself. He threatened to do as
                    much in the recorded conversation on 25 August 2009:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Considering the nature of their relationship,
                    I find it believable that Dr Chee would seek and accept
                    Mr Chang’s instructions on a variety of issues, including what
                    account to pay his fees from (as stated in her email of 12 July 2006), how
                    to frame the nature of payments for him (as seen from the covering letter for
                    Wilcare’s $15,000 payment to him in July 2006), and the shareholding
                    arrangement of the company ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I determine that Dr Chee’s payment
                    of $682,000 to Mr Chang on 13 September 2007 was based on two
                    motivations. The first was her mistaken belief that the proceeds from the sale
                    were liable to be seized by the CAD. The second was her ongoing belief in
                    Mr Chang’s false representations that he was a lawyer and that he was
                    therefore entitled to a monthly fee of $15,000 for his legal services. Taking
                    into account both these motivations, she paid him the money partly to be held on
                    trust for her to prevent its seizure, and partly on account for his legal fees
                    which had not been paid regularly since July 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Chang’s defence includes an
                    account for the sum of $682,000 as set out above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I do not believe Mr Chang’s
                    unsupported assertion that Dr Chee had asked him to return large sums of
                    money to her in cash just two weeks ($212,000 on 28 September 2007) and four
                    weeks ($60,000 on 10 October 2007) after establishing the trust arrangement
                    on 13 September 2007. While there was evidence that these two sums were
                    withdrawn from Mr Chang’s account, there was no evidence, beyond his
                    own allegation, that Dr Chee had received the two sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Chang has admitted that the 18
                    September 2007 payment of $80,000 was not made to Dr Chee but to ARA. The
                    burden was on him to establish that this was on her instructions or for her
                    benefit. He has not discharged this burden. As for the $43,785 paid to PI Energy
                    Water Treatment 2007 Sdn Bhd, I do not accept Mr Chang’s explanation
                    that this was paid on Dr Chee’s instructions as part of a business
                    venture for ARA. In an email from Dr Chee to ARA’s staff on
                    27 August 2008 and in a related handwritten note dated 1 September 2008 it
                    is stated that the $43,785 was to be regarded as a personal loan by
                    Mr Chang to ARA. I find Dr Chee’s testimony that this was part
                    of Mr Chang’s personal business more believable. In any event, the
                    burden was again on Mr Chang to establish that payment of this sum was made
                    on her instructions and he failed to discharge the burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The remaining sums in Mr Chang’s
                    account are of $90,000 supposedly in settlement of his consultancy fees from ARA
                    up to August 2007 and a balance of $116,215 which he asserts that Dr Chee
                    agreed to let him keep in December 2008 in settlement of the remainder of his
                    unpaid fees up to that time. While I accept that Mr Chang did perform some
                    business-related work for ARA, he was paid by ARA for these services on an
                        <em>ad hoc</em> basis. Mr Chang suggested that the
                    $90,000 was for payment for his consultancy fee (of $15,000 a month) for a
                    period of 12 months from September 2006 to August 2007 but that would have
                    worked out to $180,000 and not $90,000. In any event, I do not accept that he
                    was to be paid $15,000 a month for consultancy work at ARA. The figure of
                    $15,000 a month was supposed to be for his legal advice. It is also telling that
                    when Dr Chee asked for the return of her money in a conversation recorded
                    on 7 September 2009, Mr Chang did not point to any payment of part of
                    the money on her instructions or to their supposed settlement of the balance in
                    December 2008. Instead, he responded as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">As such, I do not accept Mr Chang’s evidence that part of
                    the $682,000 had been paid on Dr Chee’s instructions and the balance
                    settled by an agreement with her in December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There is also the point that there was an
                    error in Mr Chang’s statement of account. The first $80,000 which was
                    allegedly paid to Dr Chee was a duplication as elaborated above at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>. Although Mr Chang accepted
                    the error, he was not prepared to return this sum. His explanation was that the
                    overall settlement in December 2008 allowed him to retain whatever money was
                    left even though his statement of account was in error. I have already mentioned
                    that I do not accept his explanation that there was an overall
                    settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In his submission for the defence,
                    Mr Chang’s counsel raised the issue of illegality. This issue arose
                    because according to Dr Chee, she had transferred the sum of $682,000 to
                    Mr Chang to prevent the CAD from seizing it, a purpose which was illegal on
                    its face although there was no evidence that the CAD was in fact interested in
                    the sum. Unfortunately, Dr Chee’s counsel did not address this issue
                    in his reply submission and so I did not receive any assistance from him on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The general principle of illegality (also
                    known as <em>ex turpi causa</em>) is based on a public
                    policy that prevents the court from assisting a litigant whose cause of action
                    is based on illegality: <em>Holman v Johnson</em> [1775]
                    1 Cowp 341 at 343 per Lord Mansfield as quoted in <em>Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 375 (“<em>Koon Seng Construction</em>”) at [29] per Belinda Ang Saw Ean
                    J. Although the principle originated in the context of illegal contracts, it has
                    been confirmed to apply to other causes of action. As Ang J states in <em>Koon Seng Construction</em> at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In fact, the <em>ex turpi</em>
                        principle is not confined to any particular cause of action. Beldam LJ in
                            <em>Clunis v Camden and Islington Health
                            Authority</em> [1998] QB 978 observed that the <em>ex turpi</em> principle was not so limited to cases of tort. At
                        987, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">We do not consider that the public policy that the court will not lend
                            its aid to a litigant who relies on his own criminal or immoral act is
                            confined to particular causes of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is further established that illegality need
                    not be pleaded by either party to be an issue before the court. On this point,
                    Ang J states in <em>Koon Seng Construction</em> at
                    [31]-[32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Where the court is satisfied that all the
                                relevant facts are before it and it can see clearly from them that
                                the contract had an illegal object, it may not enforce the contract,
                                whether the facts were pleaded or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    The fourth proposition finds expression and is
                            applied in the case of <em>Lewis &amp; Queen v N M Ball
                                Sons</em> 48 Cal 2d 141 (1957). The illegality there did not
                            arise from the pleadings and the defendants did not raise it in their
                            defence, but the court raised the illegality of its own motion and
                            dismissed the action on that ground. The plaintiffs there argued on
                            appeal (and that too was Mr Quek’s contention) that the trial
                            court should not have raised the issue of illegality because it should
                            have confined its findings to the issues raised by the pleadings. The
                            court rejected the contention…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It therefore falls to me to address the issue of illegality
                    notwithstanding that it was not pleaded by Mr Chang or raised during the
                    trial. As mentioned, this issue was raised in respect of the $682,000 and not
                    the other sum of $45,000 initially paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The first question I must answer is whether
                    Dr Chee and Mr Chang were <em>in pari
                        delicto</em>, or to put it another way, similarly implicated in the
                    illegality of the agreement such that one cannot rely on the agreement against
                    the other. This is a requirement for the doctrine of illegality to apply:
                        <em>Holman v Johnson</em> ( <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> supra) at 343. There is authority that establishes that
                    fraud can render a plaintiff not <em>in pari delicto</em>
                    vis-à-vis a defendant and therefore not susceptible to the illegality rule:
                        <em>Hughes v Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society</em>
                    [1916] 2 KB 482 (“Hughes”). However, as noted in <em>PP v Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 154 (“<em>Intra
                    Group</em>”) at [73] by Yong Pung How CJ, in the <em>Hughes</em> case, the plaintiff was actually misled by the
                    defendant’s agent into believing that the illegal insurance contracts she
                    was taking out were in fact legal. This lack of knowledge of the illegality was
                    critical to the English Court of Appeal’s finding that the parties were
                    not <em>in pari delicto</em>. I have already found that
                    Dr Chee agreed to hand the sum of $682,000 to Mr Chang based on his
                    fraud. However, although his fraudulent statements led her to believe the money
                    might be seized by the CAD, I do not think that she was deceived into thinking
                    that the transaction was legal. Dr Chee therefore did not seem to be in the
                    same position of innocence as the plaintiff in <em>Hughes</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Intra Group</em>,
                    the respondent raised an additional point in respect of the doctrine of
                        <em>in pari delicto</em> where the transfer of property
                    was induced by a breach of fiduciary duty. This exception was based on the
                    judgement of the Federal Court of Australia in the case of <em>Weston v Beaufils</em> (1994) 122 ALR 240
                        (“<em>Weston</em>”). In that case the
                    plaintiff, Weston, sought the assistance of a solicitor, Beaufils, in avoiding
                    detection for his previous income tax evasion. Beaufils advised him to transfer
                    his property to dummy companies set up by himself and another defendant. Weston
                    followed this advice and the defendants misappropriated his property. Hill J
                    granted Weston a declaration that the companies held the property on trust for
                    him. He based this on an exception to the doctrine of illegality where the
                    tainted transfer of property was induced by a breach of fiduciary duty by the
                    defendant. The relevant parts of Hill J’s reasoning are summarised by Yong
                    CJ in <em>Intra Group</em> at [64] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The basis of [Hill J’s] reasoning is set out
                        in two important passages. At 266, he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The first, and a very relevant exception [to the doctrine of
                            illegality] on the facts of the present case, is said to apply where,
                            although the parties may be in <em>pari
                                delicto</em> in relation to the transaction which brings about
                            a transfer of property sought to be recovered, that transaction has been
                            induced by fraud of one of the parties, or there has been a breach of
                            fiduciary duty by one of the parties to the other. This is but another
                            way of saying that the parties are not in <em>pari
                                delicto</em> at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And then at 267:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In recommending, as a solicitor to Mr Weston, that moneys be paid
                            to the Coolangatta Hotel company, in which Mr Beaufils had an
                            interest, and that assets be transferred to companies under the control
                            of Mr Beaufils, the latter stood in a fiduciary relationship to his
                            client. That relationship he breached by putting himself in a position
                            where his duty and his interest conflicted. Mr Weston acted upon
                            Mr Beaufils advice. It would be unconscionable now for
                            Mr Beaufils to be in a position to defend the present proceedings
                            and thus be enriched by his own breach of duty on the basis that there
                            was an illegal arrangement to which both he and Mr Weston were
                            parties and that accordingly the loss should remain where it lay (ie on
                            Mr Weston, not Mr Beaufils). In truth, there was no equality
                            in the illegal participation. Mr Weston and Mr Beaufils were
                            not in <em>pari delicto</em>. For this reason I am
                            of the view that the defence of Mr Beaufils should fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     However, at [73], Yong CJ ultimately
                    declined to apply the exception for breach of fiduciary duties in Singapore,
                    distinguishing it from the English cases on fraud:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Where the party seeking to recover is not innocent but aware of
                        the illegality of the transaction, he cannot succeed: <em>Parkinson v College Of Ambulance Ltd</em> [1925] 2 KB 1, a
                        decision of the Court of Appeal distinguishing <em>Hughes</em>. I am not certain that the same degree of "innocence"
                        could be attributed to the plaintiff in <em>Weston</em>. Accordingly, I have my reservations as to whether it
                        forms part of the same line of decisions as <em>Hughes</em> and [<em>Shelley v Paddock</em>
                        [1980] 2 WLR 647]. I therefore think <em>Weston</em>,
                        on its facts, extends those cases to a point not as yet accepted in England,
                        or, for that matter, in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I would be inclined to apply <em>Weston</em> on the facts before me. Dr Chee had relied
                    on Mr Chang as a lawyer even though she was aware of the illegality. In
                    such circumstances, I would be inclined to think that Dr Chee was not
                        <em>in pari delicto</em> with
                Mr Chang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In any event, Dr Chee would, in my view,
                    be entitled to rely on another ground. The English case of <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> [1994] 1 AC 340 (“<em>Tinsley</em>”) is treated as the leading authority for
                    claims based on property rights acquired through an illegal transaction. Lord
                    Browne-Wilkinson’s judgment represents the reasoning adopted by a majority
                    of the House of Lords. After a review of the authorities on the enforcement of
                    legal title obtained under illegal contracts, he summarises at 370:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From these authorities the following propositions emerge: (1) property in
                        chattels and land can pass under a contract which is illegal and therefore
                        would have been unenforceable as a contract; (2) a plaintiff can at law
                        enforce property rights so acquired provided that he does not need to rely
                        on the illegal contract for any purpose other than providing the basis of
                        his claim to a property right; (3) it is irrelevant that the illegality of
                        the underlying agreement was either pleaded or emerged in evidence: if the
                        plaintiff has acquired legal title under the illegal contract that is
                        enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And extending this reasoning from legal title to equitable title at
                    371, he concludes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment to draw such distinctions between property rights
                        enforceable at law and those which require the intervention of equity would
                        be surprising. … If the law is that a party is entitled to enforce a
                        property right acquired under an illegal transaction, in my judgment the
                        same rule ought to apply to any property right so acquired, whether such
                        right is legal or equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     
          <em>Tinsley</em> was
                    followed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Top Ten
                        Entertainment Pte Ltd v Lucky Red Investments Ltd</em> [2004]
                    4 SLR(R) 559 at [34]. It does not prescribe a general rule that the
                    doctrine of illegality can be circumvented where the illegality is not relied on
                    by the plaintiff, but rather provides a special exception in the case of
                    property rights. This is explained in <em>Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd
                        (In Liquidation) v Moore Stephens</em> (A Firm) [2009]
                    1 AC 1391 by Lord Philips of Worth Matravers at 1452-1453:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The House in <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> did not lay
                        down a universal test of <em>ex turpi causa</em>. It
                        was dealing with the effect of illegality on title to property. It
                        established the general principle that, once title has passed, it cannot be
                        attacked on the basis that it passed pursuant to an illegal transaction. If
                        the title can be asserted without reliance on the illegality, the defendant
                        cannot rely on the illegality to defeat the title. … The House did
                        not hold that illegality will never bar a claim if the claim can be advanced
                        without reliance on it. On the contrary, the House made it plain that where
                        the claim is to enforce a contract the claim will be defeated if the
                        defendant shows that the contract was for an illegal purpose, even though
                        the claimant does not assert the illegal purpose in making the claim: see
                        Alexander v Rayson [1936] 1 KB 169 , approved by Lord Browne-Wilkinson at p

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Tinsley v Milligan</em> the <em>ex turpi causa</em> defence failed because the respondent did not
                        need to plead the illegal agreement in order to establish her equitable
                        title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The exception in <em>Tinsley</em> (<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> <em>supra</em>) to the doctrine of illegality is relevant
                    to the present facts. Evidence of an illegal transaction has emerged both in the
                    pleadings and in the evidence provided by Dr Chee. However, her claim is
                    based on an equitable property right that she obtained (or rather retained)
                    after settling the sum of $682,000 with Mr Chang on an express trust for
                    her benefit. Even if I hold that part of the money was not held on express trust
                    for Dr Chee but was to be held on account for Mr Chang’s legal
                    fees, I have no difficulty finding that he held that part for her on
                    constructive trust because he induced her to pay it to him through fraud
                    (following <em>Ho Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim Betsy and others and
                        another appeal</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 220 which applied

                        2</em>) (1988) 164 CLR 604; 78 ALR 1). Although
                    she described the illegal purpose of hiding funds from the CAD as the motivation
                    for this transaction, all she needed to prove her property right was that
                    Mr Chang held the money on trust for her (a fact Mr Chang did not
                    dispute) and that the money was not disbursed according to her instructions or
                    for her benefit. She did not actually need to rely on any evidence of illegality
                    to establish her property right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Applying the judgment of Lord Browne-Wilkinson
                    in <em>Tinsley</em> at 370, Dr Chee “does not
                    need to rely on the illegal contract [in this case trust agreement] for any
                    purpose other than providing the basis of [her] claim to a property
                    right”. As such, I find that her claim falls under an exception to the
                    doctrine of illegality and as such, Mr Chang is not entitled to oppose it
                    on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Chang made fraudulent
                    misrepresentations to Dr Chee. These had the effect of making her pay him
                    under a contract for service the sum of $45,000 and on trust and on account for
                    fees the sum of $682,000. I order restitution of both sums on the basis of
                    rescission of contract and money had and received respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I would like to make an additional point.
                    Notwithstanding that Mr Chang was not a lawyer, the evidence of both
                    parties suggests that he did perform considerable work in connection with
                    Dr Chee’s criminal matter. This included discussions with
                    Dr Chee alone, with Dr Chee and her counsel Peter Low together,
                    collation of documents, assistance in court during the trial and in one
                    instance, working overnight on a statement of facts. However, as Mr Chang
                    has not pleaded an alternative entitlement to a <em>quantum
                        meruit</em> payment for his efforts, I will not consider this
                    possibility further. Even if the issue had been formally raised, I would have
                    hesitated to reward a person who provided services on the basis of fraudulent
                    representations about himself. That might encourage a fraudster to proceed with
                    his fraud knowing that even if his fraud was discovered he would still be
                    reimbursed on an alternative basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In any event, in view of the circumstances, I
                    will not order payment of any interest by Mr Chang. However, he is to pay
                    the costs of the action to Dr Chee to be agreed or taxed.</p>
