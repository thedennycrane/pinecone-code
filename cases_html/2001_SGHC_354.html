<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>BACKGROUND

<p></p></b></i>1.    The Plaintiff is Ng Poh Guan (Mr Ng).

<p xmlns="">2.    In his Statement of Claim, he alleged that there was an oral agreement

between he and the First Defendant Chan Ai Leng (Ms Chan), who represented herself, the Second

Defendant Apirade Pramersa and the Third Defendant Ak Tiong Hua, for him (Mr Ng) to buy the shares

of the First to the Third Defendants in the Fourth Defendant Honey Entertainment Pte Ltd (Honey).

The purchase price was $328,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Honey had the benefit of a tenancy of No 33 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01,

#01-02, #01-03, #01-04 and #01-05/06 Singapore 238977 (the Premises). It had entered into an

agreement dated 3 September 1999 with the landlord Hong Joo Company Pte Ltd (the Landlord) to

rent the Premises for a term of three years commencing from the expiry of a two-month rent-free

period, which rent-free period was to commence upon issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The terms of the oral agreement between Ms Chan and Mr Ng were set out in a

letter of intent dated 9 September 2000 and pursuant to such terms, certain payments by him were

made. Also, a formal agreement was to be drafted and signed.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    Mr Ng alleged that there was a subsequent oral agreement on 14 October 2000

between Ms Chan and him under which, inter alia:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the Defendants would procure the drafting of and submission to him of the

  formal share agreement on or before 18 October 2000,<br/>

  (b) if there was any breach by the Defendants, he would be refunded everything he had paid, half

  of all rent payments from 1 October 2000 and liquidated damages of $125,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">6.    He alleged that the Defendants were in breach of the oral agreements. The

allegations in respect of breach were:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) they failed to deliver any draft of the formal share agreement by 18

  October 2000 or at all,<br/>

  (b) the Defendants failed to take any step towards the drafting of the formal sale agreement,<br/>

  (c) the First to Third Defendants had caused the Fourth Defendant to surrender the Premises back

  to the Landlord without just and reasonable cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">7.    He alleged that the consideration for whatever payments he had made had

failed and the Defendants had received and had had the use of the same, and he was entitled to and

did rescind the oral agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    He claimed the return of whatever monies he had paid and $125,000 as

liquidated damages.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    In their Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendants did not deny that there

was an oral agreement between Mr Ng and Ms Chan pertaining to the sale of the shares in Honey to Mr

Ng. They alleged that the letter of intent did not set out all the terms agreed or accurately.

However, it turned out that the alleged difference in terms was not material.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    The Defendants also did not deny the subsequent oral agreement on 14

October 2000.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    However the Defendants denied any breach.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    The Defendants alleged that the keys to the Premises were handed to Mr Ng

on 12 October 2000 for the purpose of cleaning, and doing some fitting up, and to enable him to

re-position some air-conditioners but not to demolish anything without the concurrence of the

Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    However, on or around 14 October 2000, Mr Ng had caused the following to be

demolished:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Two of the 200mm thick party walls<br/>

  (b) Toilet walls, wall tiles and toilet accessories<br/>

  (c) Electrical installations<br/>

  (d) Kitchen exhaust<br/>

  (e) Built-in furniture and fittings<br/>

  (f) Three built-in DJ counters<br/>

  (g) Three built-in bar counters</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">14.    I will refer to these works as the Unauthorised Works.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    The Defendants alleged that as a result of the Unauthorised Works, the

Landlord was furious. The Landlord had threatened to re-enter the Premises and to claim damages.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    As a consequence, the Defendants had to negotiate with the Landlord

resulting in the surrender of the Premises to the Landlord and a deduction of $10,000 from a tenancy

deposit so as to avoid having to pay further damages.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    The Defendants counter-claimed:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) loss of the two year tenancy,<br/>

  (b) loss of the time spent on renovations of the Premises,<br/>

  (c) loss of profit if the Fourth Defendant had continued with the tenancy with the Landlord,<br/>

  (d) loss of a chance to sell the shares in the Fourth Defendant to any other party,<br/>

  (e) return of various licences which had been handed to Mr Ng pending completion of the sale,<br/>

  (f) refund of the sum of $10,000 paid to the landlord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">18.    In his Defence to Counterclaim, Mr Ng asserted that Ms Chan had personally

endorsed the Unauthorised Works even before the commencement thereof but abandoned this assertion at

trial.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    Mr Ng also alleged that if the prior concurrence of the Landlord was

required, it was the responsibility of the Defendants to obtain the same and not him.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    He also repeated the allegation that the Fourth Defendants surrender of

the Premises to the Landlord was without just cause and unwarranted.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    The pleadings of Mr Ng and of the Defendants were atrocious. In many

material parts, they made no distinction between the First to Third Defendants on the one hand and

the Fourth Defendant on the other hand.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The amendment of the Defence and Counterclaim, while addressing some of the

deficiencies, did not address all of them.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    The Amended Defence and Counterclaim also still failed to assert Honeys

cause of action as against the Plaintiff, given that Honey had no contract with Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    At the conclusion of the trial, I declared that it was Mr Ng who was in

breach of his contract with Ms Chan and the Second and the Third Defendants.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    I dismissed Mr Ngs claims and ordered him to pay damages to Ms Chan and

the Second and the Third Defendants to be assessed. However their damages were not to include any

loss of profit if Honey had continued with the tenancy of the Premises because the evidence showed

that the First to Third Defendants were not intending to continue with any operation of a pub and,

if Mr Ng had not breached his contract, he would have owned and controlled Honey in any event.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    Honeys counter-claim for damages was dismissed and consequential orders

were made regarding the licences.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    Mr Ng has appealed against that part of my decision which is adverse to

him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>
<em><strong>FURTHER ALLEGATIONS AND FACTS</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">28.    At the time of the trial, Mr Ng was operating a pub at 27 Mohamed Sultan

Road.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (AEIC), he explained that in

August 2000, he was keen on operating a pub along Mohamed Sultan Road. He found the Premises

suitable and on 2 August 2000, his agent offered to rent the Premises from the Landlord at $50,000 a

month. Upon further investigation, he discovered that Honey had a tenancy of the Premises for about

$30,000 a month (the actual rent was $32,000 a month). Accordingly, he decided to try to take over

Honeys tenancy by taking over Honey. He thought he could achieve this as Honeys business was

not doing very well then.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    With this in mind, he met Ms Chan on 6 September 2000. Ms Chan was

agreeable, on behalf of herself and the other shareholders of Honey, to sell all the shares in Honey

to Mr Ng for $328,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    To Mr Ng, this route would enable him (a) to save on some rent, (b) there

would be minimal renovations and (c) he had estimated that it would take him less than a month to

spruce up the place and open for business (para 7 of his AEIC).</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    During the discussions with Ms Chan, she had told him that Honey needed

money to pay the Landlord some monies owing. As he did not wish to jeopardize Honeys tenancy, he

agreed to and did issue a cheque for $32,960 in favour of the Landlord (para 8 of his AEIC).</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    Ms Chan and Mr Ng signed the letter of intent on 9 September 2000. Although

this document is stated to be subject to contract, both sides proceeded at the trial on the basis

that it constituted or evidenced a binding agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    Subsequently on 18 September 2000, he met Ms Chan who informed him that

more money was required to pay debts including monies owing to the Landlord. It was common ground

that he eventually paid $100,000 (including the $32,960) as part payment of the purchase price (NE

12 line 15 and 16).</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    In cross-examination, he said that he had received a copy of Honeys

tenancy agreement in September or the first week of October 2000. He said he did read the agreement

and Clauses 2(g), (h) and (j) and 4(e) thereof.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.    Clause 2(g), (h) and (j) state:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">2. The Tenant hereby covenants with the Landlord as follows:-</p>
<p align="justify">(a) </p>
<p align="justify">(b) </p>

<p align="justify">(e) </p>

<p align="justify">(g) to carry out at their own expenses all or any of the following works within

  the demises premises:-</p>

    additional power points, light fittings, etc;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Any alternation works relating to existing ceiling light fixtures,

<p align="justify">(iv) Provision of carpets and other approved floor covering or finishes

  specialist sub-contractors <u>nominated or approved by the Landlord</u>, in accordance with the

  approved plans and specifications <u>to be endorsed by the Landlord.</u> Where prior approval by

  the relevant building authority is necessary, no works shall commence until such approval is

  obtained in writing. All professional fees, charges and expenses incurred in this regard shall be

<p align="justify">(i) </p>
<p align="justify">(j) Not to make any alterations <u>structural or otherwise</u> to the demised

  immediately engage a contractor to remove the same and the Tenant shall reimburse the Landlord the

  cost for the removal of the unauthorised structure;<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">37.    Clause 4(e) states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">4(e) That if the rents hereinbefore reserved or any part thereof shall at

  any time be in arrears and unpaid for seven (7) days after the same shall have become due (whether

  legally demanded or not) <u>or if the Tenant shall at any time fail or neglect to perform or

  observe any of the covenants and agreements herein contained and on the Tenants part to be

  performed and observed</u> or if the Tenant being a Company shall enter into liquidation whether

  compulsorily or voluntarily) or the Tenant making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or

  enter into agreement or make any arrangement for liquidation of the Tenants debts by

  compensation or otherwise or suffer any distress or process of execution to be levied on the

  Tenants goods or merchandise, <u>then in such case it shall be lawful for the Landlord</u> or

  any person or persons duly authorised by the Landlord on his behalf <u>to re-enter</u> into and

  upon the demised premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole and thereupon this tenancy

  shall absolutely determine but without prejudice to any right of action or remedy of the Landlord

  in respect of any antecedent breach by the Tenant of any of the covenants or agreements herein

  contained.</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">38.    It was not disputed that on 10 or 11 October 2000, Ms Chan met with Mr Ng

at a hotel and, at his request, she signed on some renovation plans pertaining to the Premises

although she unwittingly signed where the Landlord should have signed.</p>
<p xmlns="">39.    On 11 October 2000, Mr Ngs solicitors Kenneth CP Tan &amp; Liew (Kenneth

Tan) forwarded to the solicitors for all the Defendants M.N. Swami &amp; Yap (M N Swami) a

draft of a loan agreement and of a shareholders agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    On 12 October 2000, M N Swami replied to suggest a meeting on Saturday 14

October 2000.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    In the meantime, the keys to the Premises were given to Mr Ng for the

reason I have mentioned above (see para 12).</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    In the meeting of 14 October 2000, various matters were discussed with a

view to signing a formal agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    In the meantime and unknown to Ms Chan, the Unauthorised Works were being

carried out.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.    Ms Chans evidence was that on 15 October 2000, she received a telephone

call from the Landlords agent who told her that the Landlord was furious about the Unauthorised

Works, although at that point in time, he might not have been aware of all the Unauthorised Works.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    The next day, she went to the Premises to check and found that the padlock

or padlocks had been changed. However, she looked in to see the Unauthorised Works.</p>
<p xmlns="">46.    Ms Chan sought the help of M N Swami and Honeys architect Mr Yeo Chye

Teck (Mr Yeo).</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    On 18 October 2000, M N Swami sent an urgent fax to Kenneth Tan. It said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Dear Sir</p>
<p align="justify">RE: HONEY ENTERTAINMENT PTE LTD<br/>

  AND SHARE AGREEMENT</p>
<p align="justify">We refer to the meeting held between the parties on Saturday 14<sup>th</sup>

  October 2000 and to your letter to us dated 16<sup>th</sup> October 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">Our clients instruct us that they have just come to know from the Landlord of

  the premises that unauthorised renovation works had been carried out at our clients premises by

  your clients at 33 Mohamed Sultan Road and the Landlord has threatened to commence legal

  proceedings against our clients for the fundamental breach of the Tenancy Agreement whereby our

  clients not only have to restore the premises to the original state and but (sic) is liable to pay

  damages. <u>Our clients may also loose the right to continue with the unexpired term of the

  Tenancy</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">Our clients understand that no planning approval has been applied for and/or

  that no approval has been given by the relevant authority to carry out the demolition and/or

  renovation works at our clients premises. Your clients and/or agents and/or representatives had

  represented to us at the said meeting that they had the requisite approval for the said renovation

  works at our clients premises. Further our clients had also handed the said keys to the

  premises to your clients as far back as 12<sup>th</sup> October 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">Our clients are <u>still willing to abide</u> and incorporate the terms agreed

  upon at the said meeting, provided your clients get the cooperation of the<u> </u>Landlord to

  waive his objections and give the necessary approval to apply for the requisite approval from the

  relevant authority.</p>
<p align="justify">Further terms to be incorporated in the Agreement would be:</p>
<p align="justify">1. That your clients shall be responsible to obtain the requisite written

  consent from the landlord at their own expense for the renovation;<br/>

  2. <u>In the event the landlord is to exercise his rights under the Tenancy Agreement for the

  fundamental breach caused by your clients</u>, your clients should be liable for all consequences

  and losses to be sustained by our clients including the rental of the premises and loss of income

  for the unoccupied period of lease pursuant to <u>such termination.</u></p>
<u>
<p align="justify">No objection should be taken by your clients to vitiate the agreement to be

  entered into in the event of unilateral terminations (sic) of the Agreement by the Landlord</p></u>.

  <p align="justify">We have been instructed by our clients to incorporate the above terms in the

  said agreement. Further we have also been informed by our clients that they are unable to enter

  the said premises to check on the extent of the unauthorised renovation works carried out by your

  clients to the said premises. Kindly let us have a date to inspect the said premises on an urgent

  basis.<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">48.    On 19 October 2000, Kenneth Tan replied as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We refer to your fax to us dated 18 October 2000. Our instructions are as

  follows:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) <u>Our client denies carrying out unauthorised renovation work</u>. Rather,

  and as was mentioned during the meeting on 14 October 2000, it was your client who has not

  obtained all required approvals for the renovation work she did, which resulted in the landlord of

  the premises (who apparently therefore cannot be issued the CSC) demanding that she regularise

  such work within a month or face legal action.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) .</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Our client has been advised that the renovation works do not require prior

  approval from any authority prior to commencement of works. <u>They involve minor internal

  addition and alteration works, and do not compromise the structural integrity of the premises</u>.

  Nonetheless, and as your clients are undoubtedly aware, our client intends to submit necessary

  documents from time to time, according to industry practice, to the relevant authorities. However,

  and as your Mr Swami was twice informed by our Mr Lewis Koh today, <u>your client Ms Chan Ai Leng

  has not endorsed and has even taken away plans to be submitted to the URA, FSB and BCA for

  approval</u>, in breach of her agreement to "co-operate" with our client. Your client

  will undoubtedly realise that the retention of such plans is to her detriment as they are

  intended, not only to cover the intended works, but also to regularise her omission in respect of

  her renovations, and we trust she will therefore hand over the endorsed plans accordingly. Also, <u>such

  retention does not detract from her patent approval of the renovations works as borne out by the

  many plans and forms which she has already signed. In the event that, contrary to normal practice</u>,

  your client insists that all work be suspended until approvals are applied for and obtained, then

  it would not be equitable for our client to be made to continue lending your client money to pay

  the rent in the interim.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Before such time our client takes over all the shares in the Company, <u>our

  client regrets that he does not have any locus or nexus to obtain the landlords consent</u>,

  assuming in the first place that such consent is required. Our client does not see how there was

  any breach, let alone a fundamental one as alleged. We trust your client understands that our

  client cannot stop anyone from commencing legal proceedings even if, in our clients view, there

  is insufficient basis to found a legal suit.</p>
<p align="justify">Be that as it may, our client suggests that a meeting be convened tomorrow

  between your clients and ours to resolve the matter amicably.</p>
<p align="justify">We look forward to receiving your draft agreement, which was due to have been

  transmitted to us yesterday, in the meantime.<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p xmlns="">52.    Ms Chan said that when the Landlords representative saw the extent of

the Unauthorised Works, he threatened to repossess the Premises immediately as the works were

carried out without the Landlords consent or approval from the relevant authorities. He also

threatened to take legal action and hold Ms Chan and Honey liable for all damages, i.e to claim the

reinstatement costs and legal fees and forfeit the deposit (see para 13 of her AEIC and NE 49 line

18 and 19).</p>
<p xmlns="">53.    According to Mr Yeo, he had received a telephone call from the Landlord on

14 October 2000. In para 13 of his AEIC, he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">13. By the 14th of October 2000, I did not receive the said computer

  drawings or the interior design from Tony Teo to enable me to finalise the submission. However at

  about 4.30p.m on the same day, I received a phone call from the landlord that he had received

  (sic) from his upstairs tenants that there are heavy hacking from the premises. The landlord told

  me that when he went to the premises, he found that the party walls and toilet walls had been

  hacked off. He had also stated that the glass panel on the external wall outside the premises had

  been removed and that he feared that the bricks above the opening could fall. The landlord told me

  that he had taken photographs of the contractor who was seen hacking the walls. He told me that

  pursuant to what had happened to the premises without his approval, he wanted to re-possess the

  premises immediately and claim for damages. At his request I went to look at the opening from

  outside the premises to ascertain whether the bricks could fall from the top.</p>

<p xmlns="">54.    In re-examination, Mr Yeo added that the Landlords representative had

said he wanted to take action against him (NE 72 line 14).</p>
<p xmlns="">55.    On 21 October 2000, Kenneth Tan wrote to M N Swami to state:</p>

the sale of shares agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">57.    On 23 October 2000, the Landlords solicitors Dennis Singham &amp; Teresa

Chan &amp; Partners (Dennis Singham) sent an urgent fax to M N Swami. It stated:</p>

<p xmlns="">58.    In cross-examination, Ms Chan said that she had not informed Mr Ng about

Dennis Singhams fax but in re-examination she claimed that she did.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.    Subsequently the Landlords solicitors met with M N Swami on 27 October

2000 as a result of which it was agreed that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Honey would surrender the Premises on 30 October 2000 on receipt of the

  return of the deposit less $10,000 i.e $96,000 less $10,000.<br/>

  (b) The Landlord would undertake the responsibility of reinstating the Premises.<br/>

  (c) There would be no further claims by the Landlord or Honey against each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Premises were accordingly surrendered on 30 October 2000 and $86,000 was

returned to Honey.</p>
<p xmlns="">60.    In response to an inquiry by Kenneth Tan dated 30 October 2000 about the

draft agreement, M N Swami replied on 31 October 2000 to inform them that the Premises had been

returned to the Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">61.    As far as reinstatement works were concerned, Ms Chan said she had

consulted Mr Yeo and he had estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000. Mr Yeo confirmed that it

would cost not less than $300,000 (NE 66 line 15).</p>
<p xmlns="">62.    On some of the items constituting the Unauthorised Works, Mr Yeos

evidence was that the cost of reinstating just the two party walls which were demolished on Mr Ngs

instructions was estimated to be $25,000 to $30,000. The cost of reinstating the five toilets would

be $10,000 each. On these items alone, the cost would be about $80,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">63.    Ms Chan said that Honey did not have the money to do reinstatement works

and this was not challenged.</p>
<p xmlns="">64.    Mr Ngs evidence on doing reinstatement works vacillated.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.    Initially when his attention was drawn to the fax dated 18 October 2000

from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan, he said that he did not take steps to reinstate the Premises because

he was of the view that this was not the solution (NE 16 line 16 to 21).</p>
<p xmlns="">66.    He also did not believe that the Unauthorised Works would jeopardize the

tenancy agreement because they were not serious enough (NE 23 line 1 to 5). He had taken the

position that they did not affect the structural integrity of the Premises.</p>
<p xmlns="">67.    Then he said that as events unfolded he did not even have the chance to

reinstate or consider reinstating the Premises (NE 23 line 10 to 13).</p>
<p xmlns="">68.    In his view, the matter could have been regularised with a bit of

communication with the Landlord. However his idea of regularisation was to show the Landlord that

Honey was not just taking steps to rectify what had existed but to show his (Mr Ngs) plans to the

Landlord so that the Landlord could get the Certificate of Statutory Completion for the Premises (NE

24 line 10 to 17).</p>
<p xmlns="">69.    He said he kept pursuing Ms Chan for the endorsement of the plans but he

was not successful (NE 24 line 19 to NE 25 line 12).</p>
<p xmlns="">70.    On Ms Chans part, she said she took away the plan (or plans) from Mr Yeos

office as she did not want Mr Ng to carry on with renovation work without the consent of the

Landlord. She did not see any point in co-operating with Mr Ng in view of the Unauthorised Works

(para 43 of her AEIC).</p>
<p xmlns="">71.    She disagreed that she was not willing to co-operate with Mr Ng to rectify

the situation with the Landlord (NE 40 line 9 to NE 41 line 8).</p>
<p xmlns="">72.    As it turned out, the demolished party walls and toilets were not

reinstated and the Premises are currently used by someone else (NE 66 line 23 to NE 67 line 5).</p>

ARGUMENTS AND MY CONCLUSION</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">73.    Mr Ng initially took the position that the Unauthorised Works did not

require the approval of any authority. He relied on a notice issued by the Building Control

Division, Public Works Department dated 1 April 1998.</p>
<p xmlns="">74.    The notice states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p>However, there was an important note which states:</p>
<p align="justify">The above does not apply to gazetted conservation areas and monuments. (Back

  to Table of Content)</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">79.    As it turned out, the Premises were in a gazetted conservation area.</p>
<p xmlns="">80.    Even if no permission of any relevant authority was required, Honey was

still required under Clause 2(h) of the tenancy agreement (set out in para 36 above) to ensure that

any works mentioned in Clause 2(g) (which included the Unauthorised Works) be carried out by

specialist sub-contractors to be approved by the Landlord and this was not done. Indeed, in para 8

of the Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening Statement, it was conceded that the Unauthorised Works

were done without the concurrence of the Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">81.    I would add that it was also conceded that they were done without the

concurrence of the Defendants although the faxes from Kenneth Tan dated 19 and 21 October 2000,

which I have cited in paras 48 and 55 above, and Mr Ngs pleadings had alleged that the

Defendants/Ms Chan had authorised such works.</p>
<p xmlns="">82.    Also, the insistence by Mr Ng that the Unauthorised Works were not

structural was besides the point. They were done in breach of the tenancy agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">83.    Accordingly the fact that the demolished party walls and demolished toilets

have not been subsequently reinstated by the Landlord or a new tenant and the Premises are being

currently used by a new tenant did not assist Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">84.    Furthermore, while he categorised the Unauthorised Works as minor, Mr Yeo

described them as, Major and the landlord was very furious (NE 72 line 6). Also, Mr Ng did not

call any architect to give evidence on the nature of the Unauthorised Works.</p>
<p xmlns="">85.    The truth of the matter was that Mr Ng was in too much of a rush to do the

Unauthorised Works, because the faster I finish, the earlier I can open the premises for business

(NE 9 line 10).</p>
<p xmlns="">86.    He had assumed that the Landlord would not mind the Unauthorised Works and

would allow him to get the paper work done concurrently with the physical works as, in his view,

that was the normal practice. In my view, even if this was the normal practice, which would be

against the law, a landlord should at least be notified in advance of such works and his concurrence

obtained.</p>
<p xmlns="">87.    Mr Ng had said he did not want Honeys tenancy to be jeopardized when he

made some advance payments to or on behalf of Honey. Yet the Unauthorised Works did precisely just

that.</p>
<p xmlns="">88.    Mr Edwin Kung, acting for Mr Ng, submitted that Ms Chan and the other

Defendants were repudiating the sale agreement and were evidencing an intention not to be bound by

it because they had put Honey in the position where Honey would no longer have the tenancy. He also

submitted that Mr Ng had rescinded the sale agreement by a subsequent letter from Kenneth Tan dated

6 November 2000.</p>
<p xmlns="">89.    In my view, there was no doubt that Ms Chan wanted to proceed with the sale

of the shares in Honey but the Unauthorised Works had put a spanner in the works.</p>
<p xmlns="">90.    The surrender of the tenancy was not to repudiate the sale agreement but

was to mitigate the damage caused by Mr Ngs irresponsible action as the Landlord was threatening

to terminate the tenancy, forfeit the deposit and claim reinstatement and legal costs.</p>
<p xmlns="">91.    Any suggestion that the draft agreement still had not been prepared by her

solicitors by 18 October 2000, must also be seen in the context of the Unauthorised Works and the

Landlords reaction thereto. Indeed, in para 7 of the Supplement to Plaintiffs Opening

Statement, it was conceded that the Defendants had taken steps to get the agreement drafted.</p>
<p xmlns="">92.    In addition, any suggestion that Ms Chan was subsequently withholding plans

must be seen in the context that she had trusted Mr Ng by handing over the keys to the Premises only

to discover that he had carried out the Unauthorised Works. There was otherwise no reluctance on her

part to assist him. As I have mentioned, earlier she had on 10 or 11 October 2000, at his request,

when she met him at a hotel, signed some renovation plans.</p>
<p xmlns="">93.    The main point raised for Mr Ng was that Honey should not have surrendered

the Premises to the Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">94.    On this point, Mr Kung did not assert that there was no breach of the

tenancy agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">95.    Instead, he argued that the notice from the Landlords solicitors Dennis

Singham was invalid, relying on s 18(1) and (10) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap

61) (CLPA).</p>
<p xmlns="">96.    Section 18(1) CLPA states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Restrictions on and relief against forfeiture of leases.</p>
<p align="justify">18. (1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any provision or stipulation in

  a lease, for a breach of any covenant or condition in a lease, shall not be enforceable, by action

  or otherwise, unless the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach

  complained of and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to remedy the breach,

  and, in any case, requiring the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach, and the

  lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to remedy the breach, if it is capable of

  remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the lessor, for the

  breach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">97.    Section 18(10) CLPA states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(10) This section shall apply to leases before, on or after 1st August 1886,

  and shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">98.    Mr Kung argued that under s 18(1) CLPA the notice from Dennis Singham must

give sufficient details of the breach by Honey and this was not done.</p>
<p xmlns="">99.    In <i>Lee Tat Realty Pte Ltd v Limco Products Manufacturing Pte Ltd &amp;

Ors</i> <nobr>[1999] 1 SLR 263</nobr>, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) said that a valid notice under s 18(1)

CLPA must contain sufficient particulars of the alleged breach. With respect, I agree.</p>
<p xmlns="">100.    In the present case before me, the notice from Dennis Singham, which is

set out in para 57 above, did set out some particulars of breach i.e the removal of the party wall

between the units and the removal of walls to the toilets.</p>
<p xmlns="">101.    However, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the notice

constituted sufficient particulars for the following reasons.</p>
<p xmlns="">102.    First, the reference therein to Clause 2(j) of the tenancy agreement was

wrong. Clause 2(j) refers to the consent of the relevant authorities, and not of the Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">103.    Secondly, the breach was capable of remedy but the Landlord did not

require Honey to remedy the breach. This was contrary to s 18(1) CLPA.</p>
<p xmlns="">104.    I accepted that the notice was invalid. However it did not follow that

Honey should not have surrendered the Premises.</p>
<p xmlns="">105.    First, it would not serve much purpose to challenge the validity of the

notice unless Honey intended to carry out reinstatement works for which it needed more time. After

all, the Landlord could have sent a valid notice if the validity of the first notice had been

challenged.</p>
<p xmlns="">106.    Secondly, it was not disputed that Honey did not have money to do

reinstatement works. Ms Chan also accepted that she was not aware of Honeys right to do

reinstatement works under s 18(1) CLPA.</p>
<p xmlns="">107.    It was put to Ms Chan during her cross-examination that Mr Ng was not

aware that the Landlord was going to terminate the tenancy and Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to

carry out reinstatement works (NE 43 line 8 to NE 44 line 20).</p>
<p xmlns="">108.    I accepted that the subsequent notice dated 23 October 2000 from Dennis

Singham was not brought to the attention of Kenneth Tan or Mr Ng until after the Premises were

surrendered, although Ms Chan had various telephone discussions with Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">109.    On this point, I did not accept Ms Chans belated evidence in

re-examination that she had mentioned the written notice from Dennis Singham to Mr Ng in telephone

discussions with Mr Ng between 24 to 27 October 2000. In cross-examination, she had already said

that she had not done so.</p>
<p xmlns="">110.    I would add that there was no suggestion that the omission was deliberate.

Indeed, Ms Chan and Honey were under considerable pressure from the Landlord to respond to the

Landlords threat quickly.</p>
<p xmlns="">111.    In any event, the omission did not mean that Mr Ng was completely unaware

of the danger that the Landlord might terminate the tenancy. The danger had already been mentioned

in the fax from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan dated 18 October 2000 (see para 47 above).</p>
<p xmlns="">112.    As for the allegation that Mr Ng did not have an opportunity to carry out

reinstatement works, the truth of the matter was that Mr Ng did not intend to do reinstatement

works.</p>
<p xmlns="">113.    His intention was to carry on with what he had done. That is why he

asserted during cross-examination that he still expected the Landlord to endorse his plans

notwithstanding the Unauthorised Works (NE 17 line 15 to 17, NE 23 line 22 to 24, NE 24 line 10 to

17).</p>
<p xmlns="">114.    That is also why Mr Ng did nothing to redress the situation or placate the

Landlord. Even if Ms Chan did not orally tell him about the inspection on 20 October 2000, he knew

about it from the fax dated 20 October 2000 from M N Swami to Kenneth Tan, pursuant to which one key

was sent via a messenger. He did not turn up for the inspection. He also avoided approaching the

Landlord on the excuse that he had no contractual relationship with the Landlord. He could and

should have offered to see the Landlord with Ms Chan but he did not. Yet he had the temerity to say

that the matter could have been regularised with a bit of communication with the Landlord.</p>
<p xmlns="">115.    Furthermore, while Mr Kung criticised Honey for not relying on s 18(1)

CLPA, Kenneth Tan themselves did not raise this provision at the material time. I find that they

themselves had been unaware about it or had forgotten about it then. That is why the question of

reinstatement under s 18(1) CLPA was never raised in their faxes/ correspondence to M N Swami before

30 October 2000. Even after 31 October 2000 when they were informed about the surrender of the

Premises, they did not assert in any fax or correspondence that reinstatement works should have been

done or that Mr Ng had been denied the opportunity of doing such works. This was also not raised in

Mr Ngs pleadings.</p>
<p xmlns="">116.    I was of the view that s 18(1) CLPA was raised as an afterthought to

extricate Mr Ng from the mess he had created.</p>
<p xmlns="">117.    Mr Kung also argued that the chain of causation had been broken by the act

of surrendering the Premises.</p>
<p xmlns="">118.    I did not agree. The surrender of the Premises was an ordinary and natural

consequence of the Unauthorised Works.</p>
<p xmlns="">119.    It may be that Honey could have mitigated by doing reinstatement works but

that is a different point which was not specifically pleaded by Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">120.    Secondly, Honey had acted on the advice of its architect Mr Yeo who had

estimated reinstatement costs to be $300,000 and Honey did not have this sum or even the $80,000 I

have mentioned in para 62 above. It must be remembered that Honey was in dire financial straits, and

that is why it had to obtain advance payment from Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">121.    Thirdly, Honey had acted on the advice of its solicitors in agreeing to

surrender the Premises with a forfeiture of only $10,000 of its deposit. As I have said, the

intention behind the surrender was with a view to mitigating its damages.</p>
<p xmlns="">122.    Fourthly, at no time prior to 30 October 2000 did Kenneth Tan suggest that

reinstatement works be done.</p>
<p xmlns="">123.    Fifthly, everything was happening very quickly, starting with the shock of

learning about the Unauthorised Works and the Landlords fury.</p>
<p xmlns="">124.    It may well be that the Landlord was taking advantage of the situation but

it was a situation created by Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">125.    In all the circumstances, I did not think that Honey had acted

unreasonably or had failed to mitigate (assuming this had been pleaded) by surrendering the

Premises.</p>
<p xmlns="">126.    Accordingly, I was of the view that it was not Ms Chan and the Second and

Third Defendants who were in breach of contract but Mr Ng. His purported rescission of the sale

agreement was wrongful.</p>
<p xmlns="">127.    By his deliberate act in carrying out the Unauthorised Works, he had made

it impossible for the First, Second and Third Defendants to carry out their part of the sale

agreement. In my view, this entitled them not only to be excused from being unable to provide the

tenancy and carry on with the sale agreement but also to claim damages from him.<i><b></b></i></p>
