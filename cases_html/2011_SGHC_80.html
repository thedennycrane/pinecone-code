<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an action for breach of contract. The
                    plaintiff is a sole proprietorship in Malaysia and has its registered address in
                    Kuala Lumpur. At all material times in its dealings with the defendant, the
                    plaintiff was represented by one Dr Siva Ananthan
                    (“Dr Siva”) who is its chief executive officer. Dr Siva
                    is also the brother of the proprietor of the plaintiff firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore and carries on business under the name BMC Academy which is the name
                    used in this action. The defendant provides educational services and runs seven
                    centres in Singapore which offer various educational programmes including
                    professional courses such as those leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws
                    (“LLB”). One of these centres is located in Dhoby Ghaut
                    (“the Dhoby Ghaut centre”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant set up its LLB programme in 2005
                    (“the LLB programme”) and operated the same from the Dhoby Ghaut
                    centre. In August 2007, the defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff
                    which provided for the parties to collaborate in the delivery of the LLB
                    programme to students enrolled with the defendant. This contract was prematurely
                    terminated sometime in September 2007 and it is the plaintiff’s case that
                    the defendant is liable to it for breach of contract. The defendant on the other
                    hand contends that it was the plaintiff that was in breach and therefore cannot
                    maintain this claim against it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Dr Siva holds an LLB degree from the
                    University of London (1985) and a doctoral degree which he obtained in Human
                    Behaviour (Leadership) in 1992 from La Jolla University, San Diego, USA. Since
                    1986, Dr Siva has been a law teacher and at one time he ran his own private
                    law school in Malaysia. After selling the school, he joined the plaintiff which
                    provides services as a consultant on education and learning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Dr Siva first learned of the
                    defendant’s LLB programme in about 2006. He then contacted the defendant
                    to enquire if it required any consultancy services to help it expand its LLB
                    programme. A meeting with two of the defendant’s directors took place but
                    the discussions did not lead to any agreement as the defendant did not require
                    the plaintiff’s services at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The parties contacted each other again in June
                    2007. Dr Siva met Mr Shaik Mohamed Maricar s/o SM Mohamed Osman
                    Maricar (“Mr Shaik Maricar”), the founder of the
                    defendant and its chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife,
                    Mrs Khatijah Phua Anne, who is also a director of the defendant and its
                    general manager. The meeting took place at the Dhoby Ghaut centre. Dr Siva
                    was shown around the premises and the parties had fruitful discussions.
                    Mr Shaik Maricar was desirous of employing Dr Siva as a law lecturer
                    for the defendant as most of its lecturers had left. Dr Siva, however, made
                    it clear that he was not interested in being an employee and that the plaintiff
                    was in the business of providing overall academic support and worked on a profit
                    sharing model with its clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The written contract between the parties was
                    signed on 17 August 2007. It was drafted by Dr Siva and amended before
                    signature by Akbar Sharif Maricar (“Mr Akbar
                    Maricar”), the defendant’s director of operations and the son of
                    Mr Shaik Maricar. This document was entitled “Collaboration
                    Agreement relating to LLB Degree Program, Other Undergraduate &amp; Post
                    Graduate Degree Programs” (“the agreement”). Its preamble
                    noted that the plaintiff had the expertise to conduct and deliver the LLB
                    programme of the University of London and other undergraduate and post graduate
                    programmes and that the parties would work collaboratively in the delivery of
                    such programmes to students in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Among the material terms of the agreement were
                    the following. First, it was provided (cl 9.1) that the agreement would come
                    into force on the Commencement Date and would continue in force for a period of
                    five years from that date and thereafter continue for further periods of five
                    years. The term “Commencement Date” was defined (cl 1.1) as
                    being:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he start date of the responsibilities which starts when the necessary
                        approval from the Ministry of Education in the case of a teaching licence
                        and the Ministry of Manpower in the case of an employment pass both
                        applications for Dr Siva Anathan [<em>sic</em>] to
                        effectively engage his services to begin this cooperation and need not be
                        the signature date of the agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Second, Part B of the agreement which was headed
                    “The Nature of the Academic Collaboration, the Learning Experience and
                    Responsibilities of the Parties”, set out the various responsibilities of
                    the plaintiff (identified therein as LTT) and of the defendant (described

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Part C of the agreement contained the
                    arrangements for fees and payment. Clause 4.1 provided that the plaintiff should
                    have the right to inspect the receipt books and accounting records of the
                    defendant in relation to the collaborative programmes at any time. Clauses 4.2
                    and 4.3 dealt with payment to the plaintiff for its services and stated that
                    these were to be as set out in Schedule 1. Clause 8.1 obliged the defendant to
                    keep supporting documents containing all data required for the provision of
                    services under the agreement and to allow the plaintiff to inspect the same upon
                    giving reasonable notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Turning to Schedule 1, the defendant agreed to
                    pay the plaintiff, in respect of students studying at the defendant’s
                    centre for programmes run and delivered by the plaintiff, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff was entitled to 30% of
                        all fee revenues collected including registration fees as long as
                        Dr Siva taught a minimum of four subjects at any time in respect of the
                        LLB programme;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the balance of the revenue was to be shared by the plaintiff and the
                        defendant on a 50-50 profit-sharing basis;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     sub-clause 1(iii) listed the items of
                        expenditure that could be deducted from revenue for the purpose of
                        calculating profit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     under cl 2, the defendant was obliged on “a bi-monthly
                        basis” to forward to the plaintiff an account of fees collected from
                        students and on that basis, the plaintiff would send an invoice to the
                        defendant. The payment was to be made within two days of receipt of the
                        invoice; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     further, adjustments in terms of new student enrolments and withdrawals was
                        to be “made on a weekly basis”
                thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     From August 2007 onwards, Dr Siva
                    conducted several “free preview classes” to publicise the LLB
                    programme. One of the disputes between the parties is as to duration of the
                    “free preview classes”. During this period, Dr Siva informed
                    the defendant that it required a better and larger law library in order to
                    obtain recognition of the programme from the University of London. The defendant
                    subsequently made two payments of $10,000 each to Dr Siva. Both parties
                    agree that the first payment was made for the purchase of law books on behalf of
                    the defendant. In regard to the second payment, the defendant says that this was
                    also to buy law books but the plaintiff says that the second payment was part
                    payment of moneys owing to the plaintiff from the fees collected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 September 2007, the Ministry of Education
                    (“MOE”) gave permission to the defendant to employ Dr Siva as
                    a teacher to teach specified legal subjects in the LLB programme, subject to
                    Dr Siva having obtained a valid work pass from the Ministry of Manpower
                    (“MOM”). On the same day, the MOM issued an “In-Principle
                    Approval Letter for Employment Pass” by which it approved the issue of an
                    employment pass for Dr Siva for a period of 24 months. The letter also
                    provided, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the In-Principle Approval was valid
                        for six months from the date of the letter and if the Employment Pass was
                        not collected by Dr Siva within that period, the application would be
                        regarded as withdrawn;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     the In-Principle Approval allowed Dr Siva to
                        commence employment for a period of one month from the date of the letter;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     in order to
                        collect the Employment Pass, Dr Siva had to undergo a medical
                        examination and produce a satisfactory medical report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to Dr Siva, on 5 September
                    2007, he started formal lessons for the students who had enrolled in the LLB
                    programme. Thereafter, the lessons were held every week on Wednesdays, Thursdays
                    and Fridays. On Saturdays, he would give a preview of the course to prospective
                    students. Dr Siva taught five subjects initially but after week 2 of the
                    classes, he stopped teaching jurisprudence because there were no students taking
                    that subject. According to the defendant, Dr Siva did not teach any classes
                    from 5 September 2007 but only continued to conduct free preview
                    classes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 20 September 2007, the plaintiff sent an
                    e-mail to the defendant putting the defendant on notice that it had persistently
                    and continuously breached several fundamental provisions of the agreement. The
                    specific allegations were that the defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     had failed to provide adequate and
                        suitable premises for the conduct of the LLB programme because the
                        classrooms on the third floor of the Dhoby Ghaut centre were not in fit and
                        proper condition in that the air-conditioning was continuously breaking
                        down;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     had
                        failed to carry out its responsibility to market the LLB programme properly;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     had not
                        allowed the plaintiff full and free inspection of all financial records and
                        had not given full disclosure of the fees collected for the LLB
                        programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The letter went on to state that the
                    plaintiff was thereby suspending its services with immediate effect until an
                    appropriate offer of compensation was made by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There are two versions of what led up to this
                    e-mail. Dr Siva said in his affidavit that as the contract had commenced on
                    5 September 2007, the plaintiff was entitled to the accounts and receipt
                    books on 19 September 2007. The defendant, however, did not give
                    Dr Siva access to the accounts and had improperly withheld information.
                    Sometime in the middle of September, Dr Siva asked Ms Felicia Wong
                    (“Ms Wong”), the deputy centre manager, for the accounts and
                    was told she had to check with the boss. On 20 September 2007, he asked
                    Ms Wong for the accounts again and the total number of students. She told
                    him that she could not give him the accounts. Dr Siva therefore approached
                    Mr Ak bar Maricar for the accounts and was told that
                    Mr Shaik Maricar had not authorised the release of this information.
                    Dr Siva then contacted Mr Shaik Maricar and asked him about the
                    receipt books and financial statements. He said he was taken aback when
                    Mr Shaik Maricar’s response was to rudely rebuke him and say
                    “Don’t try to be funny”. It was because of this persistent
                    refusal to disclose the accounts that Dr Siva sent the e-mail of
                    20 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant’s version which came
                    across during cross-examination of Mr Akbar Maricar was that the
                    unhappiness had arisen in relation to the supply of law books. Dr Siva had
                    offered to supply law books for the defendant’s law library at the Dhoby
                    Ghaut centre and for that he needed $20,000. The defendant had given him this
                    money by way of two cheques. However, Dr Siva had not sent any books
                    thereafter and instead asked for more funds. The defendant became worried and
                    started to ask him when the books would arrive. Around 17 or 18 September,
                    one of the defendant’s employees wrote to Dr Siva and advised him
                    that the defendant had not received his book list and invoice. On
                    20 September, Mr Akbar Maricar called Dr Siva and asked him about
                    the book list. Dr Siva’s response was that if the defendant did not
                    trust him, it should buy the books itself. Mr Akbar Maricar said that in
                    that case, the funds should be returned. Dr Siva slammed down the phone.
                    Shortly afterwards, he called back and was very hostile and rude to
                    Mr Akbar Maricar before putting the phone down again. Dr Siva was
                    supposed to conduct a class that evening but he left the centre without doing
                    so. Shortly before leaving the centre, he sent the e-mail of 20 September
                    2007. Mr Akbar Maricar stated that he had indicated the details of the
                    telephone conversation with Dr Siva in his subsequent police
                report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant did not reply to the e-mail of
                    20 September. Instead, on 21 September 2007, it wrote to the MOM requesting
                    that the Employment Pass issued to Dr Siva be cancelled on the basis that
                    he was suspected of misappropriation of the defendant’s funds and as of
                    that date was no longer working for the defendant. This letter was not copied to
                    the plaintiff and the plaintiff remained unaware of it until it was produced in
                    court in the course of the trial. On 23 September 2007, Mr Akbar
                    Maricar made a police report on behalf of the defendant in which he stated that
                    the defendant suspected Dr Siva of having misappropriated the $20,000 which
                    had been given to him to purchase books for the defendant. The plaintiff was not
                    informed of this police report until sometime later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 27 September 2007, the plaintiff who had
                    not received any response to its previous e-mail, wrote again to the defendant.
                    In this second e-mail, the plaintiff repeated its allegations in regard to the
                    manner in which the defendant had breached the agreement and also elaborated on
                    the same. The plaintiff stated that because of the defendant’s failure to
                    honour the agreement, it had suffered losses and estimated the same to be
                    $580,000. The plaintiff felt it had little choice but to suspend the provision
                    of its services under the agreement with immediate effect. It then gave the
                    defendant seven days to remedy all of the breaches or pay it compensation of
                    $580,000 failing which the plaintiff threatened to commence legal action against
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant did not respond to this e-mail
                    either. Dr Siva came to Singapore in October 2007 and during that visit, he
                    was arrested and detained overnight by the police. After investigations, the
                    police informed Dr Siva that no action would be taken against him. The
                    parties had no further contact with each other thereafter. This action was
                    started by the plaintiff on 3 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim and the defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In its statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    pleaded that the defendant had breached the provisions of the agreement in the
                    following ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     in breach of cl 2.1,
                        Dr Siva was only allowed to conduct classes on the third floor of the
                        Dhoby Ghaut centre and this area was unfit for use by the plaintiff in
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       the air-conditioning
                            frequently broke down;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the defendant did not provide any LCD projector
                            and screen on many occasions thereby preventing Dr Siva from
                            conducting proper lessons;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the defendant failed to ensure that the toilet
                            facilities were clean and properly maintained for
                        use;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       the
                            defendant did not obtain the necessary approvals to allow Dr Siva
                            to conduct the classes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_21-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       the said premises were not approved by the MOE
                            for conducting classes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     in breach of cl 2.1.4, the defendant despite
                        repeated reminders from Dr Siva, arranged little or no publicity for
                        the LLB programme to be conducted by Dr Siva for nearly a month after
                        the execution of the agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     in breach of cl 2.5.1, the defendant failed to
                        ensure that the library facilities were sufficient or in existence for the
                        conduct of the LLB programme;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     in breach of cl 4.1, the defendant repeatedly
                        refused to allow Dr Siva to examine the receipt books and accounting
                        records of the defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     in breach of cl 4.2 and Schedule 1, the defendant
                        had failed to pay the plaintiff all the fees due and owing to date;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_f"></a>(f)     in breach
                        of cl 2 of Schedule 1, the defendant, despite repeated reminders,
                        refused and/or failed to give any account of the fees collected from
                        students enrolling for the LLB programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The statement of claim set out the remedies
                    sought by the plaintiff as being the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     an account of all fees and/or
                        revenue received by the defendant under the agreement pursuant to Schedule
                        1, cl 1(1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     payment of 30% of the fees or revenue received by the defendant under
                        the agreement pursuant to Schedule 1, cl 1(1);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     reimbursement of all the expenses
                        incurred by the plaintiff or its representative, Dr Siva, under the
                        said agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     payment of half of the balance of the revenue pursuant to Schedule 1,
                        cl 1(2) of the agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     the plaintiff’s loss of future profits as a result
                        of the defendant’s breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In essence, the response of the defendant as
                    set out in its defence is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     The classes for the LLB programme
                        had not commenced on 5 September 2007 because Dr Siva had
                        conducted free preview classes for the LLB programme in August and September
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Siva had not taught at least five subjects from 5 September
                        2007 as he alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendant had not breached cl 2.1 of the agreement because
                        the premises in the Dhoby Ghaut centre were fit for use and the classes for
                        the LLB programme were provided with LCD projectors and screens. The Dhoby
                        Ghaut centre was approved on 16 April 2004 and the MOE had given
                        approval on 3 September 2007 for Dr Siva to teach the LLB
                        programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        defendant had arranged adequate publicity for the LLB programme and full
                        details of the advertisements placed for the programme were set out in the
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        library facilities were adequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dr Siva had sought $20,000 for the purchase of books
                        for the library and the defendant had been induced to pay him this amount to
                        procure the books. Despite the defendant’s reminders and requests, the
                        plaintiff did not purchase any books nor account for the sum of $20,000 and
                        Mr Akbar Maricar had therefore lodged a police report against
                        Dr Siva.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_g"></a>(g)     The plaintiff had not fulfilled its responsibilities set out in cl 1.1
                        and cl 3 of the agreement. Although an employment pass for Dr Siva
                        had been approved in principle, Dr Siva did not submit a medical report
                        as required by the MOM and did not collect the employment pass and the same
                        was withdrawn on 1 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_h"></a>(h)     The defendant denied the allegations that it had
                        failed to pay the plaintiff fees and that it had failed to give the
                        plaintiff an account of fees collected from the students. The defendant also
                        alleged that it was the plaintiff that was in breach of the agreement and
                        that there were no fees due and owing to the plaintiff;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_i"></a>(i)     The defendant
                        considered that it did not have to reply to Dr Siva’s demand of
                        27 September 2007 because it was the plaintiff who had breached the
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Arising from the pleadings as summarised above
                    and the points taken during the trial, in its closing submissions, the plaintiff
                    summarised the issues as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the agreement had come into
                        force;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether
                        the defendant had breached the agreement in any of the ways alleged by the
                        plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the plaintiff was entitled to terminate the agreement by reason of
                        the defendant’s breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant’s closing submissions did
                    not dispute that the issues formulated by the plaintiff arose for consideration.
                    In relation to issue (a), its position was that the plaintiff had not conducted
                    any classes. In relation to issue (b), it asserted that it had not been in
                    breach of the agreement. In relation to issue (c), it alleged that
                    Dr Siva’s failure to submit a medical report to the MOM to fulfil its
                    requirement for the issue of an employment pass constituted a fundamental breach
                    of contract on the plaintiff’s part. Therefore the plaintiff was not
                    entitled to enforce the agreement or claim any payment from the defendant. Thus,
                    a fourth issue arises from the defendant’s submissions which is whether
                    the plaintiff had itself committed a breach of contract by failing to submit the
                    medical report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Had the agreement come into force by 20 September 2007?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Clause 9.1 of the agreement provided that it
                    would come into force on the Commencement Date and would continue in force for a
                    period of five years thereafter. As noted above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, the Commencement Date referred to the date on which the
                    parties’ responsibilities started and this was when the necessary
                    approvals from the MOE and the MOM had been obtained for Dr Siva to provide
                    his services to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It was common ground that the MOE had given
                    its approval on 3 September 2007. The dispute centred on whether
                    Dr Siva had received MOM’s approval and, further, whether he had
                    actually provided any services under the agreement. To an extent, the second
                    question is a red herring because cl 9.1 of the agreement is very clear:
                    the agreement would start when both the approvals were obtained. It does not say
                    that Dr Siva has to commence proper paid-for classes in order for the
                    agreement to be triggered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As stated in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above, on 3 September 2007, MOM had granted
                    Dr Siva an “in-principle” approval to commence employment. By
                    its terms, he was allowed to work for a period of one month and was required to
                    undergo a medical examination and collect his permanent employment pass within
                    six months. In court, Mr Shaik Maricar took the view that the
                    “in-principle” approval meant an approval for the applicant to
                    comply with certain requirements as set out by the MOM like the medical
                    examination and did not mean that the applicant was eligible to work. This view,
                    however, was not supported by any evidence from the MOM itself. Indeed,
                    Mr Akbar Maricar had earlier agreed that the “in-principle”
                    approval allowed Dr Siva to commence employment for one month from
                    3 September 2007. Subsequently, Mr Akbar Maricar tried to explain that
                    the one month was the period within which the medical examinations and x-rays
                    had to be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I do not find the defendant’s
                    interpretation of the MOM letter persuasive. The letter itself states that it
                    “allows the Employment Pass applicant to commence employment for a period
                    of one month from the date of this letter”. This plainly means that
                    Dr Siva was allowed to work for the defendant for one month. He was not
                    restricted to simply going for medical examinations and reporting the results of
                    the same to the MOM. As I read the letter, what it meant was that Dr Siva
                    could work for one month initially but that if he did not obtain the permanent
                    employment pass within that period, he would have to stop work at the end of the
                    period and would not be able to resume work until he had fulfilled the
                    requirements for the issue of the permanent employment pass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Bearing in mind the definition of
                    “Commencement Date” in the agreement and the fact that the
                    MOM’s approval letter allowed Dr Siva to work for an initial period
                    of one month from 3 September 2007, in my judgment, the agreement came into
                    force on 3 September 2007 itself. However, for completeness, I shall also
                    consider whether Dr Siva started work in fact in September
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s case is that
                    Dr Siva started lecturing enrolled students on 5 September 2007. Prior
                    to that, he had been conducting preview classes to attract students to the LLB
                    programme. The defendant says that all classes conducted by Dr Siva in
                    September 2007 were preview classes and no proper classes took place.
                    Dr Siva’s reply was that he did conduct some preview classes on
                    Saturdays during that month but that the other classes he conducted were part of
                    the LLB programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant’s contention that all
                    classes conducted by Dr Siva were free preview classes was supported by the
                    following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the plaintiff had stated in
                        further and better particulars filed by it that Dr Siva had travelled
                        to Singapore to conduct “preview classes” from
                        “16 August 2007 to 21 September 2007” and
                        accordingly, the classes held between 5 September 2007 and
                        21 September 2007 must have been preview classes. It should be noted
                        that when this was pointed out to him in cross-examination, Dr Siva
                        said that the date “21 September 2007” was obviously a
                        typographical error.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, although two former students and one co-lecturer had
                        testified that Dr Siva had taught classes, the students’ evidence
                        was flawed because the notes referred to by them in their affidavits of
                        evidence in chief were in respect of totally different subjects. It was also
                        pointed out that one of the students harboured grievances against the
                        defendant and therefore the credibility of his evidence was in
                    doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        defendant had a system of requiring its lecturers to obtain the signatures
                        of the students attending the lectures on attendance sheets provided by the
                        defendant for this purpose. In the case of the classes conducted by
                        Dr Siva, no attendance sheets had been signed or dated and nothing had
                        been handed over to the defendant for verification. Dr Siva had not
                        followed the protocol that was usually adopted to verify that an actual
                        lecture had been conducted by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, Dr Siva had previously stated that he was
                        physically present in Singapore to conduct “free” classes on
                        20 September 2007 and under cross-examination he repeated that he was
                        “there on the 20<sup>th</sup> of September to teach
                        [his] classes”. The defendant insisted that this was untrue because
                        during cross-examination Dr Siva had admitted that no class was
                        conducted on 20 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff, on the other hand, relied
                    considerably on the evidence of the two former students, Mr Ashraf Bin
                    Hassan (“Mr Ashraf”) and Mr Justin Santiago
                    (“Mr Santiago”), and that of the co-lecturer,
                    Mr Anand Jude Anthony (“Mr Anthony”), to
                    support its assertion that Dr Siva had taught proper classes in September
                    2007 and had not only conducted preview classes. I am satisfied from the
                    evidence of the students that formal classes were conducted from
                    5 September 2007 onwards. The students were not very careful in the way
                    that they filed their affidavits thus resulting in the discrepancies seized on
                    by the defendant. However, their actual evidence on the classes that were
                    conducted and why they classified such classes as formal classes rather than
                    previews was convincing. Whilst Mr Ashraf was not happy about the way he
                    had been treated by the defendant (he was abruptly told that the defendant could
                    not offer him the last year of the LLB programme and he would have to find
                    another college), he freely admitted his unhappiness and I do not think that it
                    affected his evidence on the classes conducted in September 2007. This
                    particular portion of the evidence was, in essence, supported by both
                    Mr Santiago and Mr Anthony. Mr Anthony testified that while he
                    was conducting his own classes in September 2007, he could see and hear
                    Dr Siva doing the same thing with a different group of students.
                    Mr Anthony impressed me as a truthful witness who was detached and
                    objective in the way that he testified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There was also documentary evidence to support
                    the assertion that the classes conducted on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays in
                    September 2007 were not preview classes. First of all, a free induction
                    timetable was produced and that showed that free induction classes were only
                    scheduled in August 2007. Mr Akbar Maricar agreed that no other free
                    induction timetable had been produced. Secondly, advertisements placed by the
                    defendant for the LLB programme stated “Intakes from Intermediate Part 1
                    &amp; 2 Finals starting, 5<sup>th</sup> September 2007”.
                    Thirdly, on the defendant’s application form, the date of commencement of
                    the LLB programme was stated as “5<sup>th</sup> September
                    2007”. Fourthly, Mr Anthony did fill up attendance sheets for
                    classes that he conducted. His first class for the law of trusts was held on 6
                    September 2007. Mr Anthony considered this to be a proper class although
                    Mr Akbar Maricar maintained that Mr Anthony had given a free class. As
                    the plaintiff pointed out, this evidence was not believable given that the
                    defendant had paid Mr Anthony for these classes on an hourly
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Dr Siva also provided some attendance
                    sheets for students who had attended lectures on the law of torts. In court,
                    Mr Akbar Maricar agreed that these students were existing students of the
                    defendant. If so, the likelihood was that they were attending paid classes as it
                    would not make much sense for the defendant to provide preview classes for
                    existing students. There was also some e-mail correspondence which appeared to
                    indicate that proper classes had started. Ms Wong sent Dr Siva an
                    e-mail on 17 September 2007 asking for the timetable for the intensive
                    revision lectures for those students who had to re-sit their examinations. In
                    this e-mail she gave Dr Siva details of those students who were preparing
                    for the examinations to be held in October/November 2007. Significantly,
                    Mr Shaik Maricar himself agreed in cross-examination that classes for
                    intermediate students, including revision classes for them, had started in
                    September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Dr Siva did explain that he had continued
                    to give preview classes on Saturdays in September 2007. Mr Anthony
                    testified that there were no preview classes in September 2007 but he qualified
                    his statement by testifying that he was not present in school on Saturdays.
                    Therefore, Mr Anthony could not have been aware of what happened on
                    Saturdays. As far as Mr Anthony was concerned, in September he had started
                    conducting proper classes in the courses taught by him and was no longer in the
                    preview mode. Mr Anthony’s evidence does not weaken
                    Dr Siva’s position as they were teaching different courses in the LLB
                    programme and it was reasonable for Dr Siva to conduct a few more preview
                    classes since the plaintiff had an interest in attracting as many students as
                    possible to the courses. Mr Anthony was paid on an hourly basis and
                    therefore would not have had as much incentive to carry out extra free preview
                    classes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I am satisfied on the evidence that in all
                    probability, Dr Siva did commence proper classes on 5 September 2007
                    as alleged by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the plaintiff in breach of contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Before I go on to consider whether the
                    defendant was in breach of the agreement, I think I should deal with the
                    defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff is not entitled to maintain the
                    claim because the plaintiff itself had committed a breach of contract. This
                    allegation arises from the assertion contained in the defence that because
                    Dr Siva did not submit a medical report within two weeks of
                    7 September 2007 (<em>ie</em> by 21 September
                    2007), the plaintiff was in breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The agreement itself did not contain any
                    clause requiring Dr Siva to undergo a medical examination. This requirement
                    arose out of the MOM letter giving in-principle approval. The letter stated
                    expressly that if the Employment Pass was not collected by Dr Siva within
                    six months, the application would be regarded as withdrawn. The letter was
                    accompanied by an annex in three parts. Part II was entitled “Procedures
                    and requirements for the collection of the pass”. The third paragraph of
                    this part under the heading “Medical Examination” reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purpose of collecting the pass(es), the Work Pass Division
                        requires the medical report, HIV blood test report and/or chest x-ray report
                        in English. The medical examination must also have been done within three
                        months before the date of the collection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The date 21 September 2007 does not appear
                    anywhere in the approval letter. It would appear from the language of the letter
                    that the medical examination could take place any time within the six-month
                    period for collection of the Employment Pass as long as it took place no earlier
                    than three months before the applicant wanted to collect the pass. Going by the
                    date of the letter, Dr Siva would have had up to 2 March 2008 to
                    collect the Employment Pass and could have gone for the medical examination any
                    time between 3 September 2007 and about mid February 2008 as long as he
                    collected the pass within three months of the examination date. How then could
                    Dr Siva have been obliged to go for the medical examination by
                    21 September 2007?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant’s case is that on 7
                    September 2007, Mr K Ko Ko Win (“Mr Win”), the principal
                    of the defendant’s school at the material time, had told Dr Siva
                    about the requirements set out in MOM’s approval letter and had instructed
                    him to furnish a medical report within two weeks. This evidence was not given by
                    Mr Win himself but was given by Mr Akbar Maricar during
                    re-examination. It was thus hearsay and inadmissible. Even if it had not been
                    hearsay, the defendant did not put forward any basis on which this two-week
                    deadline could have been incorporated as a term of the agreement. The defendant
                    did not plead, as perhaps it should have, that it was an implied term of the
                    agreement that Dr Siva would take all necessary steps to ensure that his
                    lectures for the defendant were not interrupted by reason of non-compliance with
                    the work permit requirements. In any case, I do not consider that the defendant
                    could have established an implied obligation on the part of the plaintiff to
                    send Dr Siva for the medical examination before 21 September 2007
                    because if Dr Siva had wanted to collect his Employment Pass on
                    2 October 2007 (<em>ie</em> just before the expiry of
                    the initial one month period so as to ensure that there was no interruption in
                    his classes), he had time up to about 26 September 2007 to see the doctor.
                    In my judgment, the defendant has failed to establish that the plaintiff was
                    contractually obliged to ensure that Dr Siva went for the required medical
                    examination on or before 21 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is also significant that the defendant did
                    not at the material time use Dr Siva’s alleged failure to undergo his
                    medical examination in time as the basis for its request for the withdrawal of
                    the application for the Employment Pass. On 21 September 2007, Mr Win
                    wrote a letter to the MOM requesting the cancellation of Dr Siva’s
                    Employment Pass. The letter stated, <em>inter
                    alia</em>,:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for approval of the abovenamed person’s Employment Pass.
                        However, he is suspected of misappropriation of school’s funds and as
                        of today he is no longer working with us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly make arrangements to cancel his Employment Pass (Q1) with immediate
                        effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was because this letter was sent that the
                    MOM withdrew its approval on 1 October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It appears to me that the allegation that the
                    plaintiff was in breach of contract because of failure to comply with the
                    medical examination requirements was an afterthought. The defendant did not
                    disclose the 21 September 2007 letter during the course of discovery for the
                    trial. This letter was only produced on the second day of the trial after I had
                    enquired whether the defendant had requested the cancellation of
                    Dr Siva’s Employment Pass. It seemed to me at that time that the
                    defendant had not been fully compliant with its disclosure obligations and that
                    this may have been because the document contradicted its pleaded case. In any
                    event, the letter once produced showed that Dr Siva’s failure to be
                    medically examined before 21 September 2007 had no impact on the
                    cancellation of his Employment Pass or on the course of events
                generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the defendant breach the contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Failure to give the plaintiff sight of receipt books and accounting
                records</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff submitted that under cl 4.1
                    of the agreement, it had the right to inspect the receipt books and accounting
                    records of the students in the LLB programme at any time. It pointed out that
                    Mr Akbar Maricar had agreed that this was the effect of cl 4.1 and
                    also that Dr Siva had in his e-mails of 20 and 27 September 2007 asked the
                    defendant for the receipt books and other accounting records. Mr Akbar
                    Maricar had maintained that prior to these two e-mails, Dr Siva had not
                    asked for these records. He had to agree, however, that the defendant had not
                    shown Dr Siva records of its own accord. From the plaintiff’s point
                    of view, it was significant that the defendant had not replied to either e-mail.
                    Mr Akbar Maricar’s explanation was that the defendant did not know
                    how to react and thought that Dr Siva was trying to abscond with the
                    $20,000 that had been paid for the books. Mr Shaik Maricar’s evidence
                    was that when he received the e-mail of 20 September 2007 he had told his
                    son to put it aside and to wait for a follow-up. Then when he received the
                    second e-mail, he was shocked again and wanted to wait for other
                    developments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff submitted that the evidence of
                    the defendant’s witnesses that they did not do anything in response to
                    Dr Siva’s e-mails was consistent with the plaintiff’s claim
                    that the defendant had failed to abide by the agreement in relation to
                    disclosure of accounting records. If the defendant had not been in breach, the
                    defendant could easily have replied to Dr Siva to rebut the allegations. In
                    fact, it alleged, it was telling that the response of the defendant to the
                    e-mail of 20 September 2007 was to write to MOM to cancel the Employment
                    Pass. Further, instead of writing to Dr Siva to tell him about the
                    cancellation of the pass, the defendant through Mr Akbar Maricar had made a
                    police report accusing Dr Siva of misappropriating the
                $20,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The defendant did not deny that the plaintiff
                    had the right under cl 4.1 of the agreement to inspect the receipt books
                    and accounting records of the students in the LLB programme at any time. The
                    defendant’s position was that prior to 20 September 2007, the
                    plaintiff had never made a request to have sight of the receipt books. The
                    plaintiff was running the LLB programme and Dr Siva, the defendant said,
                    had been given full authority in relation to that programme. He had free access
                    to any information in regard to the LLB programme because the defendant had left
                    the day to day running to him and had instructed the staff, including
                    Ms Wong who was the manager of the Dhoby Ghaut centre, to take directions
                    from Dr Siva. In fact, when Dr Siva had asked Ms Wong for a
                    breakdown of the student enrolment, it had been readily made available to him.
                    The breakdown not only showed the number of students but also the fees each
                    student had paid to the defendant and therefore the plaintiff had no basis to
                    complain that it had not had sight of the fees collected. Further, Dr Siva
                    had the attendance list of the preview classes and could have asked Ms Wong
                    to give him the accounts of those students as well but he did not do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Akbar Maricar’s evidence, which
                    was not challenged, was that Dr Siva had been introduced as the head of the
                    LLB department in August 2007. The defendant had created an office for
                    Dr Siva on the ground floor and made it clear that he was a part of the
                    defendant’s school. He also said that Dr Siva was stationed in the
                    LLB department and had every opportunity while he was there to pull up any
                    reports that he wanted to. He did not need to ask anyone for permission. He had
                    access to all records because Ms Wong was helping him out and he could have
                    asked her for anything he needed. As far as Mr Akbar Maricar was concerned,
                    the defendant’s process was transparent and all records were available to
                    Dr Siva.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The first point that arises in connection with
                    this issue is whether the plaintiff had put in any request for the inspection of
                    the records prior to 20 September 2007. In its further and better
                    particulars, the plaintiff had alleged that oral requests were made between 5
                    and 20 September 2007 and written e-mail requests were made on 20 and
                    27 September 2007. The defendant, of course, maintained that it had not
                    received any such request until the plaintiff’s e-mail of
                    20 September 2007. In court, the only direct evidence of the oral requests
                    was contained in Dr Siva’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and his
                    assertions under cross-examination. There was some indirect evidence of his
                    alleged requests to Ms Wong in the form of an e-mail which she sent him on
                    14 September 2007. The e-mail itself simply said “As
                    attached” without a reference to any specific conversation but the
                    attachment was a list of the students who had enrolled with details of the
                    courses they were taking and the fees that they had paid. This did show that
                    Dr Siva had been asking for some information and that some information had
                    been supplied though it did not indicate exactly what had been
                requested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Akbar Maricar’s evidence was
                    that he was not aware of any such oral request prior to 20 September 2007.
                    The person who would have been aware of the requests was Ms Wong. The
                    defendant, however, did not call Ms Wong as a witness. When asked why it
                    had not done so, the reply was simply that she was uncontactable without any
                    explanation as to what efforts had been made to try to contact her. I find this
                    significant. I am also conscious of the fact that the defendant did not, either
                    in September 2007 or shortly thereafter, write to the plaintiff refuting
                    Dr Siva’s allegations of his requests having been rejected. At that
                    time Ms Wong was still in the employ of the defendant and it could have
                    asked her to verify what Dr Siva had alleged. Additionally, both parties
                    agree that there was a telephone conversation on 20 September 2007 between
                    Dr Siva and Mr Akbar Maricar and it is as likely that Dr Siva
                    raised this issue during the conversation as that Mr Akbar Maricar raised
                    the issue of the books. Both parties being annoyed with each other, I think it
                    quite likely that the conversation did end badly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I therefore hold that, on the balance of
                    probabilities, Dr Siva did make requests for the information both prior to
                    20 September 2007 and was not given full inspection of the records. As
                    these requests were not fully accommodated, the defendant breached
                    cl 4.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The second issue is whether the
                    defendant’s failure to furnish the receipt books and accounting records
                    for inspection after 20 September 2007 is a breach of cl 4.1. The
                    plaintiff contends that, at the least, the defendant should have allowed
                    inspection of the records after receipt of the two e-mails and that failure to
                    do so was a breach of the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendant’s reasons for not
                    furnishing the records after the e-mail requests were made were that its
                    directors felt that Dr Siva was trying to abscond with the $20,000 and that
                    they were in shock and did not know what to do. The defendant was very
                    suspicious of Dr Siva by this time as the books had apparently not arrived
                    and he had stormed out of the centre abandoning his class scheduled for
                    20 September 2007. Whilst the defendant’s protestations of
                    helplessness are not fully believable given that it quickly took steps to cancel
                    the Employment Pass and lodge a police report, I think that the failure to give
                    access to the records at this stage was not a further breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     There was no indication in the first e-mail
                    that the suspension that the plaintiff had unilaterally imposed could be
                    resolved by remedying the breach in relation to access to the records. Instead
                    it asked for an “appropriate offer of compensation”. This was a
                    demand for payment and was both inappropriate (given that there was no
                    indication of what financial damage the plaintiff had suffered, if any) and
                    threatening as it implied that without such payment the
                    “suspension” would continue indefinitely. The inference that the
                    defendant obviously drew from that demand was that the plaintiff was no longer
                    willing to provide its services except on payment of an undisclosed and, in the
                    defendant’s view, unjustifiable amount. As noted, the defendant thought
                    that it had already given Dr Siva $20,000 under a false pretext (it had no
                    knowledge then that some books had been despatched and had had no response
                    whatever to its request for a book-list and invoice). It therefore reacted by
                    cancelling the Employment Pass and thereby, in effect, terminating the agreement
                    as the same could not continue if Dr Siva was not permitted to teach in
                    Singapore. In my judgment, in these circumstances, the defendant’s failure
                    to allow inspection upon and after receipt of the 20 September e-mail was
                    not a breach of contract. By the time of the e-mail of 27 September
                    containing, <em>inter alia</em>, a demand that the
                    defendant remedy its breaches, the contract had been terminated and there was no
                    issue of any further breach arising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I find that the defendant was in breach of
                    cl 4.1 before 20 September 2007 but not thereafter. Further, the
                    effect of the breach had been partly ameliorated by the information supplied on
                    14 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the defendant fail to comply with cl 2 of Schedule
                1?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Clause 2 of Schedule 1 provides that the
                    defendant shall forward an account of fees collected from students enrolled for
                    the LLB programme to the plaintiff on a “bi-monthly” basis. The
                    plaintiff’s position is that this clause obliged the defendant to forward
                    the account twice a month <em>ie</em> semi-monthly whilst
                    the defendant argued that the account need only be provided once every two
                    months. The actual wording of the clause is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Defendant] shall pay [the Plaintiff] according to the following
                        timetable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On a bi-monthly basis [the Defendant] shall forward an account of fees
                        collected from students on the programmes to [the Plaintiff];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on this account [the Plaintiff] will send an Invoice to [the
                        Defendant]. Payment should be made to [the Plaintiff] within 2 days of
                        receipt of invoice;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Adjustments in terms of new student enrolments and withdrawals shall be
                        made on a weekly basis thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The various dictionaries produced by the
                    parties indicated that the term “bi-monthly” has two meanings: it
                    can mean twice a month or it can mean once every two months. The defendant
                    argued that as the agreement was drafted by the plaintiff, the term should be
                    read <em>contra proferentem</em> against the plaintiff and
                    should be given the meaning ascribed to it by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     There are two stages in deciding whether to
                    apply the <em>contra proferentem</em> principle. The first
                    stage involves determining whether there is an ambiguity in the contract which
                    cannot be resolved by interpreting the term in the context of the overall
                    contract. The principle cannot apply to create an ambiguity where one does not
                    exist. (See <em>Mohammed Shahid Late Mahabubur Rahman v Lim
                        Keenly Builders Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1021 at [68].) There is no difficulty with the first
                    stage here because the dictionary definitions have demonstrated that
                    “bi-monthly” is inherently ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The second stage involves identifying the
                    person (“the <em>proferens</em>”) against
                    whose interest the ambiguous term should be read. The <em>proferens</em> could be either the person who seeks to rely on the
                    term or the person who proposed the term for inclusion in the contract. Both
                    parties here seek to rely on the term <em>albeit</em>
                    choosing different interpretations thereof so the first way of identifying the
                        <em>proferens</em> is not applicable. The defendant
                    uses the second way and says that the principle should be applied so as to
                    construe the term “bi-monthly” against the plaintiff because of
                    the fact that Dr Siva was the main draftsman of the agreement. The
                    defendant cited <em>Tam Wing Chuen v Bank of Credit and Commerce
                        Hong Kong Ltd</em> [1996] 2 BCLC 69 where Lord Mustill held
                    that “the person who puts forward the wording of a proposed agreement may
                    be assumed to have looked after his own interests”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The English position is, however, that the
                    principle cannot be applied where both parties were involved in the drafting of
                    the agreement. The case of <em>Levison v Farin</em> [1978]
                    2 All ER 1149 held that <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> is irrelevant where the clause “emerged as a
                    result of joint efforts” (at p 1156) and <em>Kleinwort
                        Benson v Malaysian Mining Corp Berhad</em> [1988] 1 WLR 799
                    agreed that this principle did not apply to a joint drafting effort. It is
                    useful to consider the observation in <em>GA Estates Ltd v
                        Caviapen Trustees Ltd (No 1)</em> (1993) SLT 1037 that
                    “in ordinary contracts where parties are contracting on an equal footing
                    it may fairly be assumed that the ultimate terms are arrived at by mutual
                    adjustments and do not represent the language of one party more than the
                    other”. The plaintiff also brought to my attention the case of <em>Oxonica Energy Ltd v Neuftec Ltd</em>
                    (2008) EWHC 2127 where the court held that the maxim <em>contra proferentem</em> operates most comfortably in standard
                    term contracts, where one side puts forward the document on take it or leave it
                    terms. The court further stated that it is harder to apply the maxim to the case
                    of contracts that have been individually negotiated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The present case involves a negotiated
                    contract. Mr Akbar Maricar stated in court that he had negotiated with
                    Dr Siva on the terms of the agreement and, specifically, that there were
                    negotiations regarding the “financials” of the agreement.
                    Mr Akbar Maricar also asserted that he had made sure that the
                    defendant’s interests were protected in the negotiation. Whilst the
                    defendant tried to play down the number of amendments that had been effected to
                    the first draft by reason of the negotiations, it did admit that changes asked
                    for by it had been incorporated. There is no doubt that during the negotiations,
                    the defendant had every opportunity to raise its concerns and ensure that its
                    terms were included in the agreement. This was not a case of a standard form
                    contract which the defendant had no choice but to take or leave. In the
                    circumstances, I agree with the plaintiff that the <em>contra
                        proferentem</em> principle should not be applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Given that the term “bi-monthly”
                    is ambiguous, I still have to construe the agreement in order to determine its
                    meaning in the context of the agreement. Going through this exercise, it appears
                    to me that giving the term the meaning “twice a month” would be to
                    give it its proper construction. The other terms within Schedule 1 substantiate
                    the plaintiff’s contention that this would be the commercially sensible
                    interpretation. As cited above, cl 2 of Schedule 1 contains a stipulation
                    that “adjustments in terms of new student enrolments and withdrawals
                    shall be made on a weekly basis thereafter”. The fact that adjustments
                    are to be made weekly supports the construction that the schedule requires a
                    payment report to be given to the plaintiff twice a month. If
                    “bi-monthly” had meant “once every two months” it
                    would have been more logical for the adjustments to be made monthly rather than
                    weekly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The defendant argued that the
                    “weekly” adjustment was intended as a reference to enrolments and
                    withdrawals rather than a weekly adjustment of fees. This argument does not pay
                    sufficient attention to the language of the schedule as a whole. The rubric of
                    Schedule 1 is “Fees and Payment” and this appears above cll 1, 2
                    and 3 thereof. That rubric indicates that the purpose of the schedule is to deal
                    specifically with payment rather than with enrolment or withdrawal. Further, in
                    cl 2 itself, the word “adjustments” starts a new sentence
                    which comes after the sentence “Payment should be made to [the defendant]
                    within 2 days of receipt of the invoice”. This indicates that the
                    adjustments to be made are adjustments of fees collected by the defendant having
                    regard to new enrolments and new withdrawals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It should also be remembered that the e-mail
                    that Ms Wong sent the plaintiff on 14 September 2007 contained a
                    report of the fees paid by the students. Although it was not presented as an
                    account of fees, this payment report was made about nine days after the
                    agreement had commenced (5 September 2007) and lends some credence to
                    Dr Siva’s evidence that the parties did not consider
                    “bi-monthly” to mean once in two months only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I accept the plaintiff’s submission that
                    on the proper construction of the agreement, the term “bi-monthly”
                    meant twice a month and that this interpretation makes business common sense in
                    the circumstances that prevailed between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     This holding means that the defendant should
                    have provided the plaintiff with an account of fees collected on
                    19 September 2007. The defendant did not do so. The plaintiff did not
                    accept the payment report of 14 September 2007 as being the account of fees
                    because Dr Siva doubted the veracity of that report. He testified that he
                    had noted that in all there were about 40 students attending classes taught by
                    him. The payment report, however, named only 25 students. It was for that reason
                    that Dr Siva had been anxious to examine the defendant’s financial
                    records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The defendant did not contend that it had
                    complied with cl 2 if that clause meant that the account of fees had to be
                    furnished twice a month. Its rejection of the allegation of breach was based on
                    its assertion that this obligation had not arisen because two months had not
                    passed since the inception of the agreement. Accordingly, I hold that on
                    20 September 2007 the defendant was in breach of cl 2 of Schedule
                    1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the defendant fail to comply with cl 2 of the
                agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff made various averments in its
                    statement of claim to support its allegation that the defendant had breached
                    cl 2 of the agreement. The defendant denied these assertions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The first contention was that the
                    air-conditioning on the third floor broke down regularly and was poorly
                    maintained and therefore the premises were unfit for use. The evidence for this
                    averment was Dr Siva’s assertion to that effect in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief. The plaintiff also pointed out that during cross-examination
                    Mr Akbar Maricar had agreed that the air-conditioning on the third floor
                    was in a bad condition. However, even if the air-conditioning did not work
                    properly all the time, this does not mean that the defendant was in breach of
                    contract. Mechanical and engineering systems do break down from time to time and
                    such breakdowns have to be dealt with in the usual course of events. Whilst
                    Mr Ashraf agreed that there were problems with the air-conditioning,
                    neither Mr Santiago nor Mr Anthony, who also spent a considerable
                    amount of time in the premises, complained about it or alleged that the problems
                    were so bad that they were not able to conduct or sit for their usual classes.
                    It is also significant that Mr Akbar Maricar testified during
                    cross-examination that whenever there was a problem with the air-conditioning,
                    the defendant would arrange for a technician to attend to the problem. This
                    evidence was not challenged. Overall, there is insufficient evidence for me to
                    hold that the premises were unfit for use due to lack of
                ventilation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Dr Siva also gave evidence that at times
                    he did not have the use of LCD projectors for his lessons. Whilst Mr Akbar
                    Maricar had stated that all the classes were equipped with projectors, the
                    documents disclosed by the defendant indicated it owned only two projectors.
                    Mr Ashraf’s testimony had supported Dr Siva’s assertion in
                    that he said that several classes commenced late because the LCD projector was
                    not set up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There is nothing in the agreement that
                    specifically requires LCD projectors to be available for all lessons although
                    perhaps this requirement can be inferred from cl 2.1.5 which obliged the
                    defendant to provide all learning resources required for delivery of the LLB
                    programme. In any case, it is not that the defendant had no projectors, just
                    that it had only two projectors and these had sometimes to be moved from class
                    to class. Mr Anthony did not make a complaint that his classes were
                    disrupted by the lack of such projectors. Although some of Dr Siva’s
                    classes may have started late because it took a while for the projector to be
                    set up, that does not, to my mind, indicate that the agreement was breached
                    because proper resources were not made available. It was a small matter which
                    could have been easily resolved by administrative means. Indeed, in his e-mail
                    of 27 August 2007, Dr Siva himself treated the fact that no projector had
                    been set up for his class as being a failure of the administrative system. I
                    find that the defendant was not in breach of the agreement in this
                    regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Another complaint about the premises made by
                    Dr Siva was that the toilets on the third floor were often smelly and that
                    the students had complained about them. Mr Ashraf echoed this evidence and
                    said that he had made several complaints about the condition of the toilets. The
                    defendant denied that the toilets were dirty and produced evidence that it
                    employed full time cleaners to clean them. The plaintiff countered this evidence
                    by arguing that the employment documents could not show that the cleaners were
                    employed to clean the toilets at night or that the cleaners were properly
                    supervised in their job. In my view, this is another minor complaint which could
                    have been sorted out by administrative means. There is no evidence that
                    Dr Siva himself ever complained about the toilets before 20 September 2007
                    and, in my view, the plaintiff was simply using this problem of dirty toilets to
                    bolster its case in regard to the fitness of the premises. I must emphasise that
                    there was no evidence that the toilets, unpleasant though their condition may
                    have been, constituted a danger to health.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the statement of claim, the plaintiff had
                    alleged that the third floor of the Dhoby Ghaut centre was not licensed for use
                    as teaching premises. The defendant produced evidence of such licensing from the
                    MOE and the plaintiff did not pursue this point in its closing submissions. This
                    was a frivolous point and reflected the plaintiff’s tendency to overstate
                    its case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Under cl 2.1.4, the defendant was
                    responsible for managing the marketing and publicity for the LLB programmes to
                    be conducted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had
                    failed to adequately market the LLB programme in accordance with the agreement.
                    The plaintiff accepted that the defendant had placed advertisements for the LLB
                    programme but argued that these were insufficient and that the programme had not
                    been properly publicised because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant had not employed a
                        competent advertising firm to plan and market the LLB programme and had no
                        intention of doing so;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     the advertisements placed by the defendant in the
                        newspapers had no effect because those placed on 25, 26 and 28 August 2007
                        were small and did not attract many students to the free preview classes in
                        August 2007. Dr Siva also considered that the defendant had not
                        allocated sufficient resources towards marketing the LLB programme;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     although
                        the defendant had also placed an advertisement of a suitable size in the
                        newspapers on 31 August 2007, Dr Siva’s view was that that
                        was too late and an advertisement of that size should have been placed on
                        21 August 2007 when it would have alerted potential students to the
                        special free induction lessons that he was conducting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The facts are that within four days of signing
                    the agreement, the defendant placed the first advertisement of the LLB programme
                    in the Straits Times. This was the advertisement that appeared on 21 August
                    2007. Subsequently, four more advertisements were placed in the Straits Times
                    and Today in August 2007. As Dr Siva himself admitted, the advertisement of
                    31 August 2007 was of a good size. Similarly sized advertisements appeared
                    in the newspapers on 3, 6, 10 and 11 September 2007. Altogether the defendant
                    paid $13,354 (excluding GST) in charges for these advertisements. All the
                    advertisements were crafted by Dr Siva and he testified that he had no
                    dispute about their format. Indeed, the defendant had also complied with
                    Dr Siva’s instructions on placing bigger advertisements in the
                    newspapers so as to obtain better exposure for the LLB programme. It is
                    noteworthy that these instructions were given by Dr Siva after he expressed
                    disappointment with the attendance at the August preview classes and that the
                    defendant was quick to accommodate Dr Siva’s concerns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Given that the defendant had publicised the
                    LLB programme in consultation with Dr Siva, it is difficult to accept the
                    plaintiff’s current complaint that the defendant was in breach of its
                    publicity obligations under cl 2.1.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issues arising in relation to the library</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In the statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    pleaded that the defendant had failed to provide sufficient library facilities
                    for the LLB programme. It was Dr Siva’s evidence that he had found
                    the library inadequate and had asked the defendant for money to purchase books
                    so as to make it a “functional law library”. This failure to
                    provide library facilities was allegedly a breach of cl 2.1.5 of the
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     There was, however, no mention of this alleged
                    breach in the plaintiff’s closing submissions. It is interesting to
                    consider why it is that the plaintiff did not pursue this
                allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Dr Siva’s position was that when he
                    pointed out the inadequacy of the law library, he had been given $10,000 by the
                    defendant to purchase law books. He said that he had told the defendant that he
                    would sell it books from his own library and that the defendant was amenable to
                    this suggestion. Further, he had packed up the books and sent them to the
                    defendant’s office but addressed the parcel to himself there. Dr Siva
                    valued the books that he had sent out at $7,000 and said that the plaintiff
                    would have to account for the remaining $3,000. The defendant, on the other
                    hand, alleged that it had given him $20,000 for books and that there had been no
                    agreement that the books should come from Dr Siva’s own library. In
                    any case, the defendant said, it never received the books and that was why on 17
                    September 2007, an e-mail had been sent to him asking for the book list and the
                    invoice. Subsequently, sometime after the events of September 2007, a box
                    addressed to Dr Siva which was found in the Dhoby Ghaut centre had been
                    opened and the defendant had found 70 books in it, many of which apparently had
                    nothing to do with law. Dr Siva defended his choice of books by saying that
                    those that were not law books were useful for the jurisprudence
                course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     On the evidence, it appears that the defendant
                    had, contrary to Dr Siva’s assertion, paid him $20,000 for law books.
                    The two payment vouchers (of $10,000 each) which the defendant produced
                    indicated that each payment had been made for “library books”.
                    More tellingly, an e-mail from Dr Siva sent on 27 August 2007 which
                    was produced by the plaintiff only at the trial, showed that it was Dr Siva
                    who had asked for $20,000 for him “to start getting the necessary books
                    and law reports”. Thus, contrary to what he later maintained, all of the
                    money was for purchases for the library. This contemporaneous e-mail was
                    detrimental to Dr Siva’s credibility on this issue. It also helps
                    explain the defendant’s anxiety when it did not receive the promised books
                    and had no response to its e-mail for an invoice and list of books. It should be
                    noted that the books sent included, apart from legal textbooks, philosophical
                    writings by persons like Aristotle, John Stuart Mill and Plato. Dr Siva
                    justified the non-law books as being necessary for jurisprudence. He also,
                    however, included in the box several study guides which had been written by the
                    University of London but which were supplied free by that institution. The
                    difficulty for the defendant was in valuing these items. Dr Siva himself
                    did not provide a breakdown of the second-hand values of the various textbooks
                    but asserted that in total they were worth $7,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I am satisfied on the evidence that the
                    plaintiff had no basis for its complaint in the statement of claim about
                    inadequate library facilities. Dr Siva had been given money to remedy this
                    deficiency and although in court he asserted that at least $100,000 would be
                    required to adequately stock the library, he produced no evidence to back up
                    that estimation. He was not even able to produce books that were worth the
                    $20,000 given to him since on his own evidence his books were worth only $7,000.
                    The defendant asserted that it thought that Dr Siva was going to buy books
                    from a third party in Malaysia and that was why it asked for the invoice. There
                    was no evidence that the books from Dr Siva’s library were worth even
                    the $7,000 at which he valued them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Whilst the plaintiff could not justify its
                    complaint about the library, Dr Siva’s undertaking to procure books
                    may explain why the parties fell out on 20 September 2007. On that day,
                    Dr Siva and Mr Akbar Maricar had an unpleasant telephone conversation.
                    Mr Akbar Maricar asked Dr Siva about the books and Dr Siva lost
                    his temper. I believe this evidence given by Mr Akbar Maricar as there
                    is some contemporaneous support for it in the police report filed a few days
                    later. Perhaps Dr Siva felt threatened in some way by the enquiry regarding
                    the books and that caused him to lose his temper and walk out of the Dhoby Ghaut
                    centre without conducting the class scheduled for the same evening. To me it
                    appears to have been an over-reaction but at least it explains his behaviour to
                    some extent. Dr Siva’s own explanation for his behaviour in walking
                    out and sending the e-mail of 20 September 2007 to suspend the
                    plaintiff’s services, is that Mr Akbar Maricar and
                    Mr Shaik Maricar refused to show him the accounts. This is less
                    believable because he had not asked for the accounts in writing and also the
                    accounts were only overdue by one day. The plaintiff was capable of expressing
                    its complaints in long e-mails and whilst it may have been concerned at the
                    discrepancy between the list of students given to it by Ms Wong and the
                    actual number of students who had attended the classes, this concern was not
                    elaborated in any correspondence between 14 September 2007 and
                    20 September 2007 (<em>ie</em> before the plaintiff
                    suspended its services). It therefore does not appear to me that this concern
                    was vitally important at the time. No doubt Dr Siva thought that it was a
                    matter that could be sorted out once the plaintiff had seen the
                records.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the plaintiff entitled to terminate the agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I have found that the defendant was in breach
                    of contract in two ways, <em>viz</em> firstly by failing to
                    forward the account of fees to the plaintiff on a bi-monthly basis, and
                    secondly, by failing to give the plaintiff full inspection of its receipt books
                    and accounting records prior to 20 September 2007. The question that arises
                    is whether these breaches entitled the plaintiff to terminate the
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The legal principles which determine when an
                    innocent party is entitled to terminate a contract by reason of breach on the
                    part of the other party to the contract are set out in <em>Sports
                        Connection Pte Ltd v Deuter Sports GmbH</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 883 (“<em>Sports
                    Connection</em>”) and <em>RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v
                        Seto Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413
                        (“<em>RDC Concrete</em>”). There are four
                    situations. First, where the term of the contract which has been breached
                    clearly states that as a result of the breach the innocent party is entitled to
                    terminate, a right of termination accrues to the innocent party. Second, where
                    the party in breach of the contract by its words or conduct renounces the
                    contract, the innocent party can terminate. Third, where the term which has been
                    breached is a condition, the innocent party is entitled to terminate. The fourth
                    situation is that the innocent party is entitled to terminate if the breach of
                    the term deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it
                    was intended to receive from the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The plaintiff accepts that the first situation
                    does not apply to the present case. It, however, argues that the plaintiff had
                    the right to terminate because at least one of the other situations
                    applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In relation to the second situation, the
                    argument is that the defendant, by refusing to allow the plaintiff access to the
                    receipt books and accounting records and by its failure to forward the account
                    to the plaintiff in accordance with cl 2 of Schedule 1, had by conduct
                    renounced the agreement. The plaintiff contends that the defendant’s
                    breaches showed a blatant disregard for the agreement and clearly evinced an
                    intention to the plaintiff that it would not perform its contractual obligations
                    at all. I do not accept this argument. There may have been some traction for it
                    if the whole litany of alleged breaches had been established. Since I have found
                    in the plaintiff’s favour in respect of only two of its complaints,
                    however, the contention is somewhat threadbare. The defendant’s conduct
                    has to be considered in the round and when this is done, these two breaches do
                    not, to my mind, demonstrate that the defendant was not intending to perform its
                    obligations. On the contrary the evidence established the defendant’s
                    commitment to the collaboration in that the defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_a"></a>(a)     had paid money to advertise the LLB
                        programme;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_b"></a>(b)     had
                        set up Dr Siva as the head of the LLB programme and instructed the
                        staff to take instructions from him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_c"></a>(c)     had given Dr Siva a substantial amount of money to
                        supply books for the law library; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_d"></a>(d)     was actively engaging with Dr Siva in the promotion
                        and presentation of the LLB programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that
                    the facts fall within the third situation. In this respect, it contends that
                    cl 4.1 was a condition of the agreement. It submits that the plaintiff and
                    the defendant intended this term to be a condition and that it would not make
                    commercial sense to argue otherwise as the matter of the fees collected by the
                    defendant and payment to the plaintiff would go to the root of the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It is clear that cl 4.1 is an important
                    term because the right of inspection of the receipt books and accounting records
                    that it provides would enable the plaintiff to check the fees received by the
                    defendant and ensure that it was receiving its contractual share of the same.
                    This, however, does not mean that the term was a condition. First, the parties
                    did not nominate it as a condition and this could easily have been done had that
                    been the intention since Dr Siva, who drew up the bulk of the contract on
                    behalf of the plaintiff, would have been well aware of the significance of
                    describing any particular term as a condition. Second, the parties contemplated
                    a long term relationship of at least five years with the defendant being given
                    the right to terminate the agreement only after two years had passed and then
                    only if the programmes run by the plaintiff did not reach break-even point. It
                    was foreseeable that during those five years there might be times when there
                    would be practical difficulties in providing the plaintiff with a continuous
                    right of inspection. For example, at some points of time the books of account
                    and records of the defendant might have to be provided to auditors and for that
                    purpose might be taken out of the office for a short period of time. At other
                    times the person in charge of the books might be unavailable and the records,
                    accordingly, inaccessible. It could not have been the parties’ intention
                    that failure to allow inspection during such periods would be a breach of
                    contract entitling the plaintiff to terminate. In my judgment, cl 4.1 is
                    not a condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As a further alternative, the plaintiff argues
                    that the defendant’s breaches fell within the fourth situation identified
                    because the nature and consequences of the breaches deprived the plaintiff of
                    substantially the whole benefit of the agreement. I do not accept this either.
                    First, as far as the breach of cl 4.1 was concerned, whilst the plaintiff
                    had not had access to the receipt books and accounting records, it had been
                    given some accounting information <em>via</em> the e-mail
                    of 14 September 2007 and the period during which access was not made
                    available was a period when the collaboration was starting and therefore proper
                    procedures had not been set down. The plaintiff may have recognised this since
                    it did not make any written complaint before 20 September
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Second, the inspection would have been
                    necessary to countercheck the accuracy of the account of fees which the
                    defendant was supposed to furnish every half month pursuant to cl 2 of
                    Schedule 1. On 20 September 2007, the account was not yet in the
                    plaintiff’s hands and therefore the plaintiff was not yet prejudiced in
                    any way by being unable to check the records. As far as the breach of cl 2
                    of Schedule 1 was concerned, the defendant was late by only one day and this was
                    at a time when new students were still being recruited and the administration
                    had not yet settled down. It is not clear to me on the evidence, despite
                    Dr Siva’s assertions, that if the plaintiff had written formally to
                    the defendant asking for the account specified in cl 2 that the same would
                    not have been furnished within a reasonable time. There was nothing to indicate
                    from the defendant’s behaviour that it did not intend to furnish the
                    account at all. There was perhaps a misunderstanding on the part of the
                    defendant as to when the account needed to be provided, but if Dr Siva had
                    raised this issue clearly in writing, it could have been discussed and worked
                    out. The defendant at that stage needed Dr Siva and the plaintiff’s
                    services very badly as it had only one other law lecturer and he did not have
                    the experience or track record of the plaintiff in running the LLB programme. It
                    is clear to me from the terms of the collaborative agreement which were in
                    favour of the plaintiff financially (it took 30% of the fees upfront leaving 70%
                    out of which the expenses had to be met so that the defendant received only 50%
                    of the net balance, if any) that the defendant was keen to make its
                    collaboration with the plaintiff work. This was also shown by its willingness to
                    spend money on publicity and books.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In the context of a five year relationship,
                    the initial difficulties could be seen as teething troubles and were capable of
                    being ironed out to the satisfaction of both parties. The breaches established
                    were not, to my mind, of such a nature or consequence to call into question the
                    whole benefit of the agreement to the plaintiff. If these breaches had continued
                    for some time or there had been similar breaches of a persistent nature over the
                    next few months that might have altered the situation, but this did not happen
                    and that was principally because of the plaintiff’s actions on
                    20 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that
                    although the defendant was in breach of the agreement in the ways identified
                    above, such breaches did not give the plaintiff the right to terminate the
                    agreement. Its remedy for the same would have been in damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Unfortunately, the e-mail that Dr Siva
                    sent to the defendant after his telephone conversation with Mr Akbar
                    Maricar was in uncompromising terms. He put the defendant on notice that it had
                    “persistently and continuously breached several fundamental
                    provisions” of the agreement and specified these as being the
                    defendant’s failure to provide suitable premises; its failure to market
                    the programme properly and to allow the plaintiff full and free inspection of
                    all financial records. At the end of the e-mail, the defendant was put on notice
                    that despite “many verbal reminders” it had not taken appropriate
                    remedial action and that the plaintiff was “suspending [its] services
                    until and [<em>sic</em>] appropriate offer of compensation
                    is made by you”. This was a strong reaction to complaints that were
                    mostly of a minor nature. It told the defendant that no more services would be
                    provided until compensation was paid. There was no indication in the e-mail of
                    any willingness on the part of the plaintiff to sit down with the defendant and
                    discuss what needed to be done to deal with the complaints and improve the
                    situation for the benefit of all parties. In my judgment, since the plaintiff
                    was not entitled to terminate the agreement and had only a remedy in damages (if
                    proved), it was not entitled to suspend its services at all much less assert a
                    right to withhold them until payment of compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Dr Siva’s failure to deliver the
                    scheduled lesson on 20 September 2007 and the plaintiff’s decision to
                    suspend its services thereafter were, in my judgment, breaches of contract on
                    the part of the plaintiff. As stated earlier, the defendant thought that the
                    plaintiff no longer wished to carry on with the contract and reacted by writing
                    in to the MOM the next day to procure the cancellation of Dr Siva’s
                    employment pass. Three days later, the police report was made. By then,
                    effectively, the agreement was at an end.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">To what remedies is the plaintiff entitled?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The defendant asserted in its defence that the
                    plaintiff was itself in breach of contract. I have found the plaintiff to be in
                    breach, although the breach found by me was not the breach asserted by the
                    defendant. Since the defendant did not mount a counterclaim, however, I do not
                    have to consider what possible remedies can be claimed by the defendant. I only
                    need to consider what remedy the plaintiff can get for the breaches of contract
                    that it has established. In this connection, I have to reject the
                    defendant’s submission that because the plaintiff was in breach of
                    contract, it cannot claim any damages. That is not the legal position even
                    though I have found breaches on the part of the plaintiff as well. The plaintiff
                    has established the defendant’s breaches and, if it can establish loss, is
                    able to claim for those breaches notwithstanding its own fault which was
                    independent of the defendant’s breaches. The fault of the plaintiff could
                    have resulted in an award of damages to the defendant if there had been a
                    counterclaim. In this case, however, the default of the plaintiff would not have
                    the consequence of depriving it entirely of any remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I have set out in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above the remedies sought by the plaintiff in its statement
                    of claim. In the closing submissions, the plaintiff does not address the various
                    remedies serially but instead asks for an order for damages to be assessed.
                    Presumably the plaintiff thinks that such an order would encompass all the other
                    remedies. I think I should make it clear, however, exactly what the plaintiff is
                    entitled to in view of the fact that it has been able to establish only two
                    breaches and was also in breach of contract itself, such breach leading to the
                    termination of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The first remedy asked for by the plaintiff is
                    an account of all fees and/ or revenue received by the defendant under the
                    agreement pursuant to cl 1(1) of Schedule 1. I hold that the plaintiff is
                    entitled to such an account in respect of students who registered during the
                    period from 17 August 2007 up to 20 September 2007 for courses to be
                    taught by the plaintiff and to damages representing the fees that the plaintiff
                    would have been paid for such students for such period on a pro rata basis in
                    accordance with Schedule 1 of the agreement. The assessment of damages under
                    this order would cover the second remedy asked for by the plaintiff, it being
                    noted the plaintiff is not entitled to a flat 30% of all fees or revenue
                    received from such students since Dr Siva did not teach four classes
                    throughout the academic year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The third remedy that the plaintiff asked for
                    was reimbursement of all expenses incurred by it or Dr Siva under the
                    agreement. Clause 4.4 of the agreement provides that each party shall meet its
                    own costs for “all travel, accommodation, subsistence and associated
                    costs for any meetings for the purposes of [the agreement]”. In view of
                    that provision, I consider that the plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement
                    of any expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The fourth remedy that the plaintiff wanted
                    was payment of half of the balance of the revenue pursuant to Schedule 1,
                    cl 1(2). Whether any amount is payable in this respect will have to be
                    determined on the assessment after taking into account the damages payable to
                    the plaintiff pursuant to <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above and the
                    fact that the plaintiff would only be entitled to a pro rata portion of the half
                    of the balance of the revenue since the plaintiff did not conduct any classes
                    from 20 September 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The plaintiff is not entitled to damages for
                    loss of future profits which is the fifth remedy claimed since it was the
                    plaintiff’s breach that led to the termination of the agreement and since
                    the plaintiff was not entitled itself to terminate the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     It should also be noted that as against any
                    damages awarded to the plaintiff, the defendant will be entitled to set-off the
                    sum of $20,000 less the value of the books supplied by the plaintiff as assessed
                    by the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    There will be judgment for the plaintiff for
                    damages to be assessed in accordance with the guidelines in <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> and <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a>
                    above. Regarding costs, as the amount of damages payable may not exceed the
                    District Court limit, I will leave it to the Registrar who conducts the
                    assessment of damages to determine the appropriate costs order.</p>
