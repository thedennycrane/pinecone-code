        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These two appeals came before us after a long
                    and somewhat convoluted procedural course. Unfortunately, some part of the
                    litigation has been in vain because, in our judgment, the respondent’s
                    claim for damages was premised on a fundamental conceptual error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Civil Appeal No 48 of 2013 (“CA
                    48/2013”) concerns two interrelated contracts. The first contract was
                    governed by an arbitration agreement while the second was governed by a
                    jurisdiction clause in favour of the Singapore courts. The second contract
                    provided that a breach of its terms would also give the respondent the right to
                    terminate the first contract. The respondent purported to exercise this right
                    when the appellant breached the second contract. The critical issue in this
                    appeal is whether the respondent can claim, in an action for breach of the
                    second contract, damages for its loss of profits arising from the termination of
                    the first contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In Civil Appeal No 55 of 2013
                    (“CA 55/2013”), the appellants, who are the directors of the
                    appellant in CA 48/2013, are appealing against the High Court’s refusal to
                    set aside an order for substituted service of examination of judgment debtor
                    (“EJD”) orders that had previously been issued against them. The
                    appellants are foreign nationals who are ordinarily resident overseas. The issue
                    raised is whether a Singapore court has the jurisdiction to issue an EJD order
                    against company officers who are ordinarily resident overseas, and if so,
                    whether leave is required for service of the EJD orders out of
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       We reserved judgment after the hearing of oral
                    arguments. Having considered the matters, we have decided to allow both appeals
                    for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellant in CA 48/2013 is Burgundy Global
                    Exploration Corporation (“Burgundy”), a Philippines company
                    engaged in the business of exploring and developing oil and gas resources in the
                    Philippines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The five appellants in CA 55/2013 are the
                    directors of Burgundy (the “Directors”), and they are ordinarily
                    resident in the Philippines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The respondent in both appeals is Transocean
                    Offshore International Ventures Limited (“Transocean”), a company
                    listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It supplies mobile offshore drilling
                    units and provides drilling services for oil and natural gas
                reserves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contractual relationship between Burgundy and
                Transocean</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Under an offshore drilling contract dated
                    29 September 2008 and a novation agreement dated 30 October 2008
                    (collectively, the “Drilling Contract”), Transocean agreed to
                    supply a semi-submersible drilling rig (the “Rig”) and provide
                    offshore drilling services to Burgundy. Article XI of the Drilling Contract
                    provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>ARTICLE XI – ESCROW AGREEMENT</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It shall be a condition precedent that prior to Commencement Date under
                        this Contract, [Burgundy] and [Transocean] shall enter into an Escrow
                        Agreement in the manner approved by [Transocean].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Pursuant to Article XI, Burgundy and Transocean
                    entered into an escrow agreement on 31 October 2008 (the “Escrow
                    Agreement”). The Escrow Agreement required Burgundy to deposit certain
                    amounts into an escrow account following a specified timeline, failing which
                    Transocean was entitled, among other things, to terminate the Drilling Contract.
                    The material clauses were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>2.   </b>
<b>Acknowledgement</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Burgundy depositing the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Account
                        in accordance with clause 3.2, Transocean acknowledges that the requirements
                        of Article XI of the Drilling Contract are satisfied by the execution of
                        this Agreement by Burgundy and Transocean.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Burgundy failed to make the initial deposit of
                    US$16.5m (the “Escrow Amount”) into the escrow account by 15
                    December 2008. One week later, by a letter dated 22 December 2008, Transocean
                    informed Burgundy that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was exercising its right under cl
                        2 of the Escrow Agreement to terminate the Drilling Contract with immediate
                        effect; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Burgundy’s failure to deposit the Escrow Amount constituted a
                        repudiatory breach of the Escrow Agreement which Transocean accepted as
                        terminating the Escrow Agreement with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Burgundy replied the next day saying that it
                    respected Transocean’s decision but that the parties should
                    “cooperate and find a suitably workable solution”. However,
                    nothing came out of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Transocean’s suit against Burgundy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 29 January 2009, Transocean commenced Suit
                    No 87 of 2009 (“S 87/2009”) against Burgundy for its breach
                    or repudiation of the Escrow Agreement. In its Statement of Claim (Amendment No
                    2), Transocean claimed the following relief (amongst others):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that Burgundy was in
                        repudiatory breach of the Escrow Agreement;</p>

                    account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Instead, the
                    Escrow Agreement was governed by a separate dispute resolution clause which

                    pleaded that it was not liable because Transocean had breached various implied
                    terms (which are not germane to this appeal). It further pleaded that even if
                    Transocean was entitled to any damages under the Escrow Agreement, it was
                    precluded from making any claim for consequential losses by reason of Art 19.1
                    of the Drilling Contract, which provides as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Burgundy also pleaded that it did not cause the losses claimed
                        by Transocean and that, further or in the alternative, the damages claimed
                        were too remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After Burgundy filed its defence, Transocean
                    applied for summary judgment against Burgundy. The summary judgment application
                    was granted by AR Teo Guan Siew (“AR Teo”) on 7 October 2010,
                    whose decision was upheld on appeal by Quentin Loh J (“Loh
                    J”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The assessment of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The assessment of damages commenced on 23
                    April 2012 before another assistant registrar (“AR Tan”). On the
                    first day of the hearing, Burgundy was not represented by counsel. Through its
                    representative, one Mr Richer Andaya (“Mr Andaya”), it
                    applied to vacate the hearing dates on the ground that it had discharged its
                    former lawyers and needed more time to engage new counsel. AR Tan adjourned the
                    hearing for one day to enable Burgundy to engage counsel on an urgent
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The next day, Mr Rakesh Vasu (“Mr
                    Vasu”) and Ms Winnifred Gomez (“Ms Gomez”) – who are
                    representing Burgundy in this appeal – appeared on behalf of Burgundy
                    seeking a further adjournment of the hearing. AR Tan eventually dismissed
                    this application because Burgundy failed to furnish security for costs in the
                    sum of $324,000 by 3pm on 24 April 2012. Mr Vasu and Ms Gomez then successfully
                    applied to discharge themselves, and the assessment hearing proceeded with
                    Burgundy being unrepresented. Mr Andaya was present as an observer but had
                    no right of audience and gave no evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the conclusion of the hearing, AR Tan
                    awarded Transocean damages in the sum of US$105,536,922 plus interest, which was
                    derived from the following computation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     total revenue that Transocean would
                        have earned under the Drilling Contract (US$126,292,500), <em>minus</em></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     total expenses that Transocean would have incurred in performing the
                        Drilling Contract (US$24,494,185.53), <em>plus</em></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     costs of mitigation reasonably incurred by Transocean
                        (US$3,738,607).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Following AR Tan’s
                        decision, Transocean entered final judgment against Burgundy on 25 April
                        2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The EJD applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 7 June 2012, Transocean applied for and
                    obtained EJD orders (“the EJD Orders”) against the Directors as
                    officers of Burgundy pursuant to O 48 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R
                    5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). No leave to serve the EJD Orders out of
                    jurisdiction was obtained. Between June and November 2012, Transocean made three
                    unsuccessful attempts to serve the EJD Orders on the Directors in the
                    Philippines through a law firm there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 3 October 2012, Transocean filed a summons
                    seeking liberty to effect substituted service of the EJD Orders. The prayers
                    sought were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    [Transocean] be at liberty to effect Service of any
                            Order for Examination of Judgment Debtor in SUM 2826/2012/A (the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On 4 January 2013, AR Ruth Yeo (“AR Yeo”)
                        granted orders in terms of Prayers 1(i), 2 and 3. No order was made on
                        Prayer 1(ii). Transocean proceeded to serve the EJD Orders on Gomez &amp;
                        Vasu LLC on 14 January 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 18 February 2013, the Directors applied to
                    set aside AR Yeo’s order allowing substituted service on the basis that
                    the EJD Orders were effectively subpoenas and were required to be served
                    personally. The application was dismissed by an assistant registrar (“AR
                    Liew”) on 4 March 2013, who held that service of the EJD Orders was
                    governed by O 11 r 8, O 48 r 1(2) and O 62 r 5 of the ROC (read
                    together) and that these requirements had been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Burgundy appealed against AR Tan’s award
                    of damages while the Directors appealed against AR Liew’s dismissal of the
                    setting-aside application. Both appeals were dismissed by the High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”), whose decisions are reported as <em>Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd v Burgundy Global
                        Exploration Corp</em> [2013] 3 SLR 1017 (“<em>Transocean (Damages)</em>”) and <em>Serafica
                        Rogelio T and others v Transocean Offshore Ventures Ltd</em> [2013] 3
                    SLR 1040 (“<em>Serafica</em>”)
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With respect to Burgundy’s appeal, the
                    Judge rejected Burgundy’s argument that Transocean’s claim for
                    damages fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the Drilling
                    Contract. The Judge did so on the basis that the Drilling Contract was not
                    itself the source of the parties’ rights and obligations giving rise to
                    Transocean’s claim; rather, he thought it was only a point of reference
                    for ascertaining the financial consequences of Burgundy’s breach of the
                    Escrow Agreement (<em>Transocean (Damages)</em> at [18]).
                    The Judge further held that properly construed, Art 19.1 did not exclude a claim
                    by Transocean for loss of the net profits arising from the termination of the
                    Drilling Contract (<em>Transocean (Damages)</em> at [29]).
                    Finally, the Judge varied AR Tan’s award of damages with respect to
                    Transocean’s mitigation expenses. AR Tan had allowed Transocean to recover
                    the actual expenses it incurred in cold-stacking the Rig (including preparatory
                    work) from 23 May to 15 November 2009, but the Judge held that Transocean should
                    only be allowed to recover its expenses until end August 2009, when the minimum
                    238-day hire period would have expired (<em>Transocean
                        (Damages)</em> at [59]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As for the Directors’ appeal, the Judge
                    rejected their attempts to equate an EJD order with an originating process or a
                    subpoena (<em>Serafica</em> at [22] and [29]). Instead, he
                    held that the service of the EJD Orders out of jurisdiction was governed by O 11
                    r 8(1), which states that leave shall not be required for service out of
                    Singapore of any summons, notice or order issued in any proceedings in which
                    leave for service of the originating process has already been granted (<em>Serafica</em> at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Directors then appealed to this Court in
                    CA 55/2013. After filing the appeal, the Directors applied for a stay of
                    execution of the EJD Orders pending the hearing of the appeal. In their
                    supporting affidavit, the Directors cited, for the first time, the decision of
                    the English House of Lords in <em>Masri v Consolidated
                        Contractors International (UK) Ltd (No 4)</em> [2010] 1 AC 90
                        (“<em>Masri</em>”), which held that under
                    the English counterpart of O 48 r 1, a court could <em>not</em> make an EJD order against an officer of a corporate judgment
                    debtor who was ordinarily resident abroad (“foreign officer”). The
                    Judge granted the stay on the basis that there was a potentially arguable case
                    that the EJD Orders should be set aside on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 48/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Burgundy bases its appeal in CA 48/2013 on two
                    main grounds. First, it submits that insofar as Transocean is claiming losses
                    arising from the termination of the Drilling Contract, such a claim gives rise
                    to a dispute under the Drilling Contract and is subject to arbitration under Art
                    25.1 of that agreement. Second, it contends that liability for loss of profits
                    is excluded by Art 19.1(a) and (c) of the Drilling Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In response, Transocean argues that the
                    question of whether it can claim its Drilling Contract losses in these
                    proceedings is <em>res judicata</em> as Burgundy’s
                    application for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration had already been
                    finally dismissed by the Court of Appeal (see [14] above). Transocean further
                    argues that in any event, the assessment of damages is a factual quantification
                    of the losses caused by Burgundy’s breach of the Escrow Agreement, and is
                    distinct from a determination of substantive liability under the Drilling
                    Contract. As long as the usual principles relating to causation and remoteness
                    and satisfied, there is no reason why Transocean should not be able to recover
                    the losses it suffered as a result of the termination of the Drilling Contract
                    even if this is sought pursuant to a claim founded on breach of the Escrow
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As for Burgundy’s Art 19.1 argument,
                    Transocean makes the following submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     Art 19.1 is an exclusion clause that
                        limits <em>liability</em>; having lost the liability
                        fight, Burgundy is precluded from raising Art 19.1 as a defence again
                        at the assessment stage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     properly construed, Art 19.1 does not exclude
                        Burgundy’s liability for loss of profits under the Drilling
                        Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     to
                        hold that Art 19.1 excludes liability for loss of profits under the Drilling
                        Contract would prevent Transocean from recovering its expectation loss and
                        defeat the commercial purpose of the Drilling Contract;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     clear and
                        specific language is required to exclude liability for deliberate
                        repudiatory breaches, which Burgundy had committed by failing to deposit the
                        Escrow Amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 55/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Directors base their appeal on the
                    submission that this Court should follow two English decisions on the scope of
                    the English counterparts of O 11 r 8(1) and O 48 r 1. The first, <em>Vitol SA v Capri Marine Limited</em> [2008] EWHC 378 (Comm)
                        (“<em>Vitol</em>”), decided that EJD
                    orders could not be <em>served</em> out of jurisdiction on
                    a foreign officer. The second, <em>Masri</em>, went one
                    step further and held that EJD orders could not be <em>issued</em> against a foreign officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the other hand, Transocean argues that the
                    wording of O 48 r 1 is wide enough to cover foreign officers, and the purpose of
                    the rule requires foreign officers to be within the Court’s reach. As for
                    the English decisions of <em>Vitol</em> and <em>Masri</em>, Transocean says that they should not be followed
                    because there are material differences between the ROC and the English Civil
                    Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (“CPR”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 48/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The main issue in CA 48/2013 is whether
                    Transocean can recover damages for losses due to the termination of the Drilling
                    Contract under a claim that is based on breach of the Escrow Agreement, or
                    whether such claims are subject to arbitration under Art 25.1 of the Drilling
                    Contract (“the Damages Issue”). A threshold question that needs to
                    be addressed is whether this issue is <em>res judicata</em>
                    as argued by Transocean.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As for the second issue regarding the effect
                    of Art 19.1 of the Drilling Contract, it will become evident that this issue
                    ought not be decided by us but should be determined in arbitration. We would
                    further note that, although this was not raised by the parties, there is another
                    exclusion clause in Art 25.1(c)(ix) of the Drilling Contract (see [13]
                    above) that might also be relevant to any claim on the Drilling Contract, but
                    which we are not required to deal with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CA 55/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     CA 55/2013 gives rise to the following
                    issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does a Singapore court have the
                        jurisdiction under O 48 of the ROC to make an EJD order against a corporate
                        officer who is based overseas (“the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
                        Issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the answer to the above issue is in the affirmative, is leave required
                        to serve an EJD order out of jurisdiction and should it be granted in the
                        present case (“the Leave Issue”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There is also the preliminary issue of whether
                    the Directors require leave to raise these issues on appeal to this Court. In
                    our view, no leave is required because although the key English cases supporting
                    Burgundy’s position were not cited below, the underlying issues and
                    arguments had been ventilated before the Judge. In any event, even if leave were
                    required, we would have granted it given that these issues are purely legal in
                    nature and do not require any fresh evidence to be adduced: see <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil
                        Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at
                    [17].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Damages Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is this issue res judicata?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The umbrella doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> has three aspects (<em>Goh Nellie v
                        Goh Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [17]). Cause of
                    action estoppel prevents a litigant from pursuing a matter that was the subject
                    of previous proceedings (<em>ibid</em> at [17]). Issue
                    estoppel prevents a litigant from raising an issue that has already been decided
                    in previous proceedings (<em>ibid</em> at [18]). There is
                    also the doctrine of abuse of process, which essentially prevents a litigant
                    from mounting a collateral attack on a previous decision (<em>ibid</em> at [19], [51]–[52]). Here, Transocean is relying on
                    the doctrine of issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is well settled that four requirements must
                    be satisfied for an issue estoppel to arise (<em>Lee Tat
                        Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No
                        301</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 at [14]–[15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     there has been a final and
                        conclusive judgment on the merits;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     that judgment was by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     there is identity between the parties to the two actions that are being
                        compared; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     there is identity of subject matter in the two
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In deciding whether the fourth
                        requirement is satisfied, the correct approach is to ask what had been
                        litigated and, secondly, what had been decided. The decision on the issue
                        must have been a “necessary step” to the decision or a
                        “matter which it was necessary to decide, and which was actually
                        decided, as the groundwork of the decision” (<em>ibid</em> at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Transocean submits that an issue estoppel
                    arises in this case because the Damages Issue had already been litigated and
                    decided during the stay proceedings. In those proceedings, Burgundy had argued
                    that since Transocean was seeking damages for losses that resulted from the
                    termination of the Drilling Contract, its claim was essentially a claim for
                    breach of the Drilling Contract and should be subject to arbitration. However,
                    this argument was rejected by Ang J in <em>Transocean
                        (Jurisdiction)</em>, whose decision was upheld on appeal to this Court
                    in CA 137/2009. Therefore, Transocean contends that Burgundy is estopped from
                    resurrecting the Damages Issue at the assessment of damages stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We disagree. It is clear to us that the
                    Damages Issue had <em>not</em> been decided, nor was it
                    necessary for it to be decided, in <em>Transocean
                        (Jurisdiction)</em>. In that case, Ang J decided not to grant a stay
                    in favour of arbitration for four reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Article XI of the Drilling Contract
                        demonstrated that the parties had agreed to carve out escrow matters from
                        the Drilling Contract and to deal with these in the separate Escrow
                        Agreement. That evinced a clear intention by the parties to subject claims
                        arising from the Escrow Agreement to the dispute resolution clause found
                        within that agreement: at [21].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     Properly construed, Art 25 of the Drilling Contract was
                        principally concerned with the resolution of claims and disputes arising out
                        of or in relation to the Drilling Contract, and did not extend to claims
                        brought by Transocean under the Escrow Agreement: at
                    [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is a trite
                        canon of construction that the general should give way to the specific.
                        Given the specificity of cl 6.2 of the Escrow Agreement, it overrode Art 25
                        of the Drilling Contract with respect to a claim that arose out of the
                        Escrow Agreement: at [25].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     Section 6(1) of the International Arbitration Act
                        (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) did not apply because proceedings instituted
                        under the Escrow Agreement did not fall within the scope of the arbitration
                        clause in the Drilling Contract: at [28].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Nowhere in his judgment did Ang J consider the
                    question of whether the specific losses claimed by Transocean were recoverable
                    in a claim brought under the Escrow Agreement; indeed, not once did he even
                        <em>refer</em> to the heads of damages claimed by
                    Transocean. As the following extract shows, Ang J was concerned solely with
                    the narrow issue of whether Transocean could proceed in Singapore courts given
                    the purported basis of its cause of action (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[Transocean’s] cause of action against [Burgundy]
                            was a straightforward claim arising from [Burgundy’s] failure to
                            pay the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Account in accordance with the
                            terms of the Escrow Agreement</em>. Indeed, [Burgundy] did not
                        dispute that it failed to deposit the requisite sum pursuant to cl 3.2(a) of
                        the Escrow Agreement. As such, the claim fell squarely within cl 3.2(a) of
                        the Escrow Agreement. [Burgundy] argued that the termination of the Drilling
                        Contract was premised on a breach of the Drilling Contract. Since Art 25.1
                        of the Drilling Contract provided that any dispute to the termination or
                        breach would be governed by arbitration, Art 25.1 would also apply to
                        [Transocean’s] claim in this action. <em>I rejected
                            this argument as the reason for the termination was [Burgundy’s]
                            breach of the Escrow Agreement.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Ang J went on to made it clear that his
                    decision rested on the premise that the dispute related to the Escrow Agreement,
                    and not the Drilling Contract (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, from a reading of the Escrow Agreement and the Drilling Contract, I
                        was of the view that the parties had intentionally carved the former out
                        from the latter and expressly subjected the former to a non-exclusive
                        jurisdiction clause rather than an arbitration clause. <em>Article 11 of the Drilling Contract demonstrated that the parties had
                            agreed to carve out escrow matters from the Drilling Contract and to put
                            them in a separate agreement. That evinced a clear intention by the
                            parties to subject claims arising from the Escrow Agreement to the
                            dispute resolution clause found within that particular
                            agreement.</em> Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the
                        motivation behind this move was to ensure quicker relief, in the event that
                        the obligations contained in the Escrow Agreement were breached than if the
                        matter were arbitrated, as there was no procedure under the London Court of
                        International Arbitration Rules for a final interim award. I agreed with
                        that submission as the obligations of the Escrow Agreement were relatively
                        straightforward and non-technical in nature, as compared with those under
                        the Drilling Contract. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thus, although the Damages Issue might have
                    been <em>raised</em> by Burgundy before Ang J and this
                    Court during the stay proceedings, it had not been <em>decided</em> on the merits. The sole issue in those proceedings was
                    whether Transocean’s action should be stayed in favour of arbitration when
                    its cause of action was based on the Escrow Agreement. The court understandably
                    did not consider the further question of whether Transocean could recover the
                    specific losses it claimed to have suffered given its pleaded cause of action,
                    which would have been more relevant at the assessment of damages stage. We
                    therefore find that the Damages Issue is not <em>res
                        judicata</em>, and it remains open to Burgundy to raise this and for
                    us to decide it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Can Transocean recover its loss of profits under the Drilling
                Contract in a claim for breach of the Escrow Agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Before we explain why we have come to a
                    different view from the Judge on the Damages Issue, we first highlight an
                    important feature of this case. This is a case where the parties had entered
                    into two contracts to give effect to a single transaction, which is the
                    provision of a drilling rig and offshore drilling services by Transocean to
                    Burgundy in exchange for the payment of money. The Drilling Contract was the
                    main contract setting out the parties’ obligations, including the services
                    to be provided by Transocean and the rates to be paid by Burgundy for those
                    services; while the Escrow Agreement was a separate contract making provision
                    for the question of how Burgundy should pay for Transocean’s services.
                    Transocean took pains to point out that there were many cross-references between
                    the two contracts: for example, cl 3.2 of the Escrow Agreement provided that the
                    sums to be deposited into the escrow account were to be fixed by reference to
                    the “Operating Rates” stipulated under the Drilling Contract.
                    There can be no real doubt that the two contracts are closely
                linked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     But despite this, it must not be overlooked
                    that the parties had deliberately carved out escrow matters from the transaction
                    and subjected it to a separate agreement. The purpose of the Escrow Agreement,
                    as Transocean says, was to provide Transocean with security so that it could
                    commit to performing the Drilling Contract without having to fear that it might
                    end up being mired in delays if Burgundy defaulted on payment. In other words,
                    Transocean’s performance interest under the Escrow Agreement was to obtain
                    security for Burgundy’s performance of its payment obligations under the
                    Drilling Contract. This must not be confused with Transocean’s performance
                    interest under the Drilling Contract, which was to make profits from carrying
                    out the contracted services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Therefore, the true damage caused by
                    Burgundy’s breach of the Escrow Agreement was the loss of its security,
                    and <em>not</em> the loss of profits under the Drilling
                    Contract. The latter loss was in fact the result of Transocean’s decision
                    not to perform the Drilling Contract without security, and however reasonable a
                    decision that might appear to be, the proper cause of action for recovering
                    those losses must be a claim under the Drilling Contract. Having deliberately
                    chosen to carve out the security aspect of the parties’ business
                    relationship and deal with it in a separate contract, Transocean cannot now seek
                    to vindicate its performance interest under the Drilling Contract by bringing a
                    claim founded on breach of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The fact that cl 3.2 of the Escrow Agreement
                    entitles Transocean to terminate the Drilling Contract upon a breach of the
                    Escrow Agreement does not change the preceding analysis. A breach of the Escrow
                    Agreement is not necessarily a breach of the Drilling Contract, and even if it
                    were, there is no legal basis for allowing Transocean to recover the losses it
                    suffered from a breach of the <em>Drilling Contract</em> in
                    an action for breach of the <em>Escrow Agreement</em>. The
                    contractual right to terminate the Drilling Contract upon a breach of the Escrow
                    Agreement is just that – a right to terminate; it does not serve to import
                    all the obligations under Drilling Contract into the Escrow Agreement and allow
                    Transocean to treat them as a single composite contract. This is a matter of
                    some significance where, as here, each contract has unique features including
                    distinct dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Thus, to recover its losses flowing from the
                    termination of the Drilling Contract, the proper course for Transocean to take
                    would have been to bring a claim in arbitration under the dispute resolution
                    clause in that agreement and prove that the Drilling Contract had been breached
                    by Burgundy and that it was entitled to damages for those losses. In our
                    judgment, this is where the Judge fell into error. In the hearing below,
                    Transocean argued that because Art 19.1 was located in the Drilling Contract, it
                    was irrelevant to a claim premised on a breach of the Escrow Agreement. The
                    Judge rejected this argument and held that Art 19.1 of the Drilling Contract was
                    material to the dispute, for the following reason (at [24]–[25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Even if Art 19.1 of the Drilling Contract was not a
                            valid defence to liability for breach of the Escrow Agreement, it did
                            not logically follow that Art 19.1 could not affect the exact quantum of
                            damages at the assessment based on a factual analysis of the specific
                            pleaded heads of loss. Transocean brought its claim as a straightforward
                            breach of cl 3.2 of the Escrow Agreement giving rise to a contractual
                            right to terminate the Drilling Contract, with losses quantified by
                            reference to the net loss of profits that flowed from the termination of
                            the Drilling Contract. <em>Assuming for the purposes of
                                argument that Transocean would not in any event have been entitled
                                to claim such loss of profits after the termination of the Drilling
                                Contract due to the exclusion in Art 19.1, Transocean could not then
                                quantify such loss of profits as damages that were causally related
                                to the breach of the Escrow Agreement.</em> This, in my view,
                            is conceptually distinct from the argument - rejected by AR Teo and
                            implicitly by Loh J - that Art 19.1 of the Drilling Contract excluded
                            any potential liability that Burgundy may owe under the Escrow
                            Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    I therefore proceeded on the basis that Burgundy
                            was not precluded from raising arguments on Art 19.1 as part of the
                            logically prior question of whether the purported net loss of profits
                            under the Drilling Contract was in fact suffered by Transocean.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While the Judge’s reasoning was correct
                    in principle, he erred in not following it to its logical conclusion. Having
                    accepted that it was important, for the purposes of establishing causation, to
                    determine whether Transocean would have been able to recover its loss of profits
                    under a hypothetical claim based on the Drilling Contract, it should have become
                    clear that the more important threshold question – before even considering
                    the effect of Art 19.1 – was <em>whether there had been a
                        breach of the Drilling Contract in the first place</em>. And once it
                    was appreciated that Transocean’s claim for loss of profits in fact
                    requires it to establish that: (a) there had been a breach of the Drilling
                    Contract, and (b) liability for loss of profits is <em>not</em> excluded under Art 19.1 or possibly Art 25.1(c)(ix) of the
                    Drilling Contract, it would have become evident that these were plainly matters
                    that, under Art 25.1(a), were reserved for arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Indeed, Transocean had sought a declaration
                    that the Drilling Contract had been validly terminated in its Statement of Claim
                    (see [12(b)] above). It thus seems that Transocean had realised from the outset
                    that its claim for loss of profits due to the termination of the Drilling
                    Contract required the anterior determination that the Drilling Contract had been
                    validly terminated as a result of a breach by Burgundy; it might have been
                    unnecessary to include this prayer otherwise. Yet this is an issue that falls
                    within the ambit of Art 25.1(a). It is noteworthy that although AR Teo had given
                    judgment in favour of Transocean on its application for summary judgment, no
                    order was in fact extracted. However, it seemed to be accepted by Transocean
                    that AR Teo had not granted this declaration in giving summary judgment for
                    Transocea. Indeed, counsel for Transocean (“Mr Toh”) informed us
                    that no submissions were made on this issue before AR Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We turn to Transocean’s argument on
                    remoteness. Transocean argues that it is entirely conceivable for the losses
                    flowing from the breach of one contract to be based on another contract, as long
                    as those losses are not too remote. In support of this proposition, Transocean
                    cited the case of <em>Satef-Huttenes Albertus SpA v Paloma
                        Tercera Shipping Co SA (The Pegase)</em> [1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
                    175 (“<em>The Pegase</em>”). In that case,
                    the defendant shipowners failed to deliver chrome sand on time to the plaintiff
                    receivers. As the plaintiff did not have adequate reserves of chrome sand and
                    there was a lack of alternative supply, it could not fulfil certain resale
                    contracts during the period of delay. Consequently, the plaintiff commenced
                    arbitration proceedings against the defendant claiming damages, among other
                    things, for the loss of profits that it would have made by reselling the sand.
                    The arbitrator stated his award in the form of a special case seeking the
                    English High Court’s opinion on a question of law, the question being
                    whether, on the facts found, the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for
                    damages for loss of profits other than by way of interest. Goff J held (at 185)
                    that there was “no rule of policy excluding or restricting recovery of
                    damages … assessed with reference to a loss of resale profits, if on the
                    ordinary principles of law such damages should be awarded”. Going on to
                    consider whether it was sufficiently within the contemplation of the defendant
                    that the plaintiff would have an immediate need of the chrome sand for resale,
                    Goff J found that the arbitrator had not made certain crucial factual findings
                    on this point and remitted the case to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the present case, Transocean submits that
                    its losses under the Drilling Contract were not too remote because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     Burgundy knew that Transocean had
                        the express right to terminate the Drilling Contract should Burgundy breach
                        the Escrow Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     further, Burgundy would have known that Transocean would most likely
                        exercise this right in the event that Burgundy failed to pay an Escrow
                        Amount, as this was the more commercially sensible option for Transocean to
                        take;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     finally,
                        it was within the parties’ reasonable contemplation that the
                        termination of the Drilling Contract would result in a loss of profits for
                        Transocean.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Thus, Transocean contends that its losses fell
                    within the first limb of <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> (1854)
                    9 Exch 341 (“<em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>”),
                    that is, damages arising naturally according to the usual course of things from
                    the breach of the contract or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in
                    the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract. We
                    disagree. Transocean’s argument was founded on an analysis of cases
                    falling within the conventional setting where a breach of a contract may give
                    rise to losses that take the form of the loss of profitable opportunities with
                    other third parties. But the setting in this case was that the same two parties
                    to a single transaction had entered into two contracts each dealing with
                    different aspects of that transaction. Each contract had different terms and
                    different dispute resolution provisions. The fact that there had been a breach
                    of one contract did not, without more, give rise to the conclusion that that was
                    also a breach of the other contract. The fact that Transocean was empowered
                    under the Escrow Agreement to terminate the Drilling Contract if there was a
                    breach of the former was consistent with the conclusion that Transocean could
                    not be compelled to proceed with the Drilling Contract without the security
                    arrangements contemplated under the Escrow Agreement. However, that was a quite
                    separate matter from whether the breach of the Escrow Agreement by Burgundy in
                    and of itself constituted a breach of the Drilling Contract. To put it another
                    way, it would not have been within Burgundy’s reasonable contemplation
                    that it could be held liable for Transocean’s loss of profits under the
                        <em>Drilling Contract</em> in a claim founded on breach
                    of the <em>Escrow Agreement.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Toh’s reliance on <em>The Pegase</em> did not take his case far because there are important
                    differences between it and the present case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, in <em>The
                            Pegase</em>, the defendant’s breach of contract <em>disabled</em> the plaintiff from fulfilling its resale
                        contracts. Here, however, Transocean <em>chose</em> to
                        terminate the Drilling Contract. Thus, to be entitled to recover its loss of
                        profits under the Drilling Contract, as we have already observed, Transocean
                        had to first establish that Burgundy’s actions under the Escrow
                        Agreement amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Drilling Contract as
                        well.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                            <em>The Pegase</em> dealt with a tripartite
                        situation where the plaintiff sought to quantify its losses by reference to
                        its anticipated profits under resale contracts with third parties, there
                        being no dispute as to the plaintiff’s legal entitlement under those
                        resale contracts. In contrast, the situation before us is that the plaintiff
                        is seeking to quantify its losses for the defendant’s breach by
                        reference to its anticipated profits under another contract <em>between itself and the defendant</em>, where there
                            <em>is</em> a dispute as to its legal entitlement
                        under that contract, and both parties had agreed that all such disputes
                        relating to that contract would be settled by arbitration. Transocean cannot
                        circumvent the parties’ agreement to arbitrate those disputes by
                        simply packaging its claim for loss of Drilling Contract profits as a claim
                        for breach of the Escrow Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Transocean has also argued that the reason for
                    carving out the Escrow Agreement and placing it under a different dispute
                    resolution regime was to ensure quicker relief for breaches of the Escrow
                    Agreement. But it seems to us that the type of time-sensitive disputes that
                    would require special treatment would include disputes such as whether an Escrow
                    Amount had been furnished or whether the conditions for releasing an Escrow
                    Amount had been satisfied. It does not seem at all evident to us that a US$106m
                    claim for lost profits arising from the termination of the Drilling Contract
                    should be the subject of an expedited dispute resolution regime. On the
                    contrary, such a claim seems to provide an excellent example of a dispute
                    revolving around the Drilling Contract and the parties’ interests
                    thereunder, and is one that a reasonable person in the parties’ shoes
                    would have fully expected to go to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<b>Has Burgundy waived its right to
                    arbitration?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     During the oral arguments, we asked Mr Toh:
                    given Transocean’s position that it could recover its loss of profits
                    under the Drilling Contract in a claim brought for breach of the Escrow
                    Agreement, what would be the position if Burgundy were to commence an
                    arbitration under the Drilling Contract seeking a declaration that it had not
                    breached that contract and therefore that the losses claimed by Transocean are
                    not recoverable under the Drilling Contract? Mr Toh conceded that on the face of
                    it, if Burgundy were to invoke the arbitration mechanism under the Drilling
                    Contract, then his position might appear to be “unsustainable”;
                    but he then argued that by engaging Transocean in the assessment process and
                    taking out numerous adjournment applications to allow itself to do so, Burgundy
                    must be taken to have waived its right to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This did not appear to us to be an argument
                    that rested on principle. Much as we sympathise with Transocean’s plight
                    in having to restart proceedings having come this far, the waiver argument in
                    our judgment has no merit. To establish a waiver by one party of certain
                    contractual rights, there must be an unequivocal representation from that party,
                    whether by words or conduct, that it is forgoing those rights: Sean Wilken &amp;
                    Karim Ghaly, <em>The Law of Waiver, Variation and
                        Estoppel</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2012) at para 4.45. No
                    such representation can be found here: Burgundy had maintained from the very
                    beginning that the dispute was subject to arbitration, and had promptly applied
                    for a stay of proceedings. After its application was rejected by Ang J (on the
                    premise that Transocean was suing for a breach of the Escrow Agreement),
                    Burgundy had continued to contest Transocean’s damages claim on the basis
                    that this was a claim relating to the Drilling Contract and must be referred to
                    arbitration. Therefore, there was not only no waiver on Burgundy’s part
                    but a consistent insistence on its right to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mr Toh pointed out that it had been open to
                    Burgundy to institute arbitration proceedings at any time to determine the
                    issues that it said were subject to arbitration. While this may be true, we fail
                    to see why or how it became incumbent on Burgundy to commence arbitration. As
                    the party making the claim, it was <em>Transocean</em> that
                    had the duty of ensuring that it made its claims in the proper forum using the
                    proper procedure. As the defendant, Burgundy was entitled to argue that certain
                    heads of damages could only be claimed in arbitration without having to commence
                    arbitration itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For these reasons, we hold that in these
                    proceedings, Transocean cannot claim the losses that it claims to have suffered
                    from the termination of the Drilling Contract. Transocean’s claim for
                    damages is therefore limited to its alternative claim for wasted costs and
                    expenses in the sum of US$55,001.46 (see [12(d)] above), insofar as these were
                    the costs that were incurred in entering into the Escrow Agreement. As this sum
                    was not contested by Burgundy during the assessment hearing, we allow
                    Transocean’s claim for this sum.</p>

                    ordinarily resident overseas. But the Directors submit that there is a
                    presumption against extraterritoriality in statutory interpretation: <em>JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 391 at [102]. Although the phrase “an officer
                    thereof” in O 48 r 1 is on the face of it wide enough to include a
                    foreign officer, the Directors say that it should nonetheless be confined to
                    company officers who are resident in Singapore because of concerns relating to
                    enforcement and international comity. In this regard, the Directors rely heavily
                    on <em>Masri</em>, where the House of Lords held that r
                    71.2 of the CPR – which is the English counterpart to our O 48 r 1 –
                    does not permit an English court to issue an EJD order against a foreign
                    officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We turn to consider <em>Masri</em> and a number of other English authorities that have
                    grappled with the issue of whether certain procedural rules should be accorded
                    extraterritorial force.</p>

        <em>Mackinnon</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Mackinnon v Donaldson,
                        Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation and others</em> [1986] Ch
                    482 (“<em>Mackinnon</em>”), the plaintiff
                    alleged that he had been swindled by two individuals, who had promised to
                    procure a US$360m property loan for him upon payment of an advance fee of
                    US$250,000 into the Citibank (New York) account of IAS, a Bahamian company.
                    Although IAS was named as a defendant, it had ceased to exist by the time of
                    litigation, rendering it impossible to obtain from it through discovery,
                    documents relating to its Citibank account. Thus, the plaintiff sought and
                    obtained an order against Citibank’s London office under s 7 of the
                    Bankers’ Books Evidence Act 1879 (c 11) (UK), which provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the application of any party to a legal proceeding a court or judge may
                        order that such party be at liberty to inspect and take copies of any
                        entries in a banker’s book for any of the purposes of such
                        proceedings. An order under this section may be made either with or without
                        summoning the bank or any other party …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The order required Citibank to produce documents held at its
                        head office in New York relating to IAS’s account. The plaintiff also
                        caused a subpoena to be issued against Citibank for the same
                    purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Hoffmann J granted Citibank’s motion to
                    discharge the order and the subpoena. He began with the general observation that
                    a state should refrain from demanding obedience to its sovereign authority by
                    foreign non-parties in respect of their conduct outside of the jurisdiction save
                    in exceptional circumstances (at 493G). But he was especially persuaded by
                    considerations specific to <em>banks</em> (at
                    496C–E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">International law generally recognises the right of a state to regulate
                        the conduct of its own nationals even outside its jurisdiction, provided
                        that this does not involve disobedience to the local law. But banks, as I
                        have already said, are in a special position. <em>The nature
                            of banking business is such that if an English court invokes its
                            jurisdiction even over an English bank in respect of an account at a
                            branch abroad, there is a strong likelihood of conflict with the
                            bank’s duties to its customer under the local law</em>. It
                        is therefore not surprising that any bank, whether English or foreign,
                        should as a general rule be entitled to the protection of an order of the
                        foreign court before it is required to disclose documents kept at a branch
                        or head office abroad. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On the facts, he found that there were no exceptional
                        circumstances justifying the order against Citibank as the plaintiff could
                        instead apply to the New York courts for the documents (at
                        499A–500C).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>In re Tucker (RC) (A
                        Bankrupt), Ex p Tucker (KR)</em> [1990] Ch 148 (“<em>Re Tucker</em>”), the issue was whether s 25(1) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act 1914 (c 59) (UK) allowed the bankruptcy court to summon
                    before it the brother of a bankrupt, who was a British citizen resident in
                    Belgium, to give information about the bankrupt’s affairs. Section 25(1)
                    stated as follows (at 152H–153B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may, on the application of the official receiver or trustee
                        … summon … any person known or suspected to have in his
                        possession any of the estate or effects belonging to the debtor, or supposed
                        to be indebted to the debtor, or any person whom the court may deem capable
                        of giving information respecting the debtor, his dealings or property, and
                        the court may require any such person to produce any documents in his
                        custody or power relating to the debtor, his dealings or property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Court of Appeal held that it did not. Dillon LJ, with whom
                        the other two judges agreed, reasoned that “the general practice in
                        international law” is that the courts of a country only have power to
                        summon before them persons who accept service or are present within the
                        territory of that country when served with the appropriate process (at
                        158D–E).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Dillon LJ found support for his conclusion in
                    two telling features of the Bankruptcy Act 1914. First, s 122 provided for an
                    alternative procedure which could be used to secure the examination of persons
                    resident in Scotland or Ireland before the bankruptcy courts of those countries
                    or within the jurisdiction of other British courts (at 154A–C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">122. The High Court, the county courts, the courts having jurisdiction in
                        bankruptcy in Scotland and Ireland, and every British court elsewhere having
                        jurisdiction in bankruptcy or insolvency, and the officers of those courts
                        respectively, shall severally act in aid of and be auxiliary to each other
                        in all matters of bankruptcy, and an order of the court seeking aid, with a
                        request to another of the said courts, shall be deemed sufficient to enable
                        the latter court to exercise, in regard to the matters directed by the
                        order, such jurisdiction as either the court which made the request, or the
                        court to which the request is made, could exercise in regard to similar
                        matters within their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Second, s 25(6) provided as follows (at
                    153E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may, if it thinks fit, order that any person <em>who if in England would be liable to be brought before it under this
                            section</em> shall be examined in Scotland or Ireland, or in any
                        other place out of England. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Dillion LJ considered this wording to be conclusive of his
                        decision, because it clearly implied that if a person is not in England he
                        is <em>not</em> liable to be brought before the English
                        court under s 25 (at 158H).</p>

                        Seagull</em>”), the Court of Appeal had to consider whether s
                    133 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) had extraterritorial effect. Section
                    133(1) stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Public examination of officers</em>. (1) Where a
                        company is being wound up by the court, the official receiver or, in
                        Scotland, the liquidator may at any time before the dissolution of the
                        company apply to the court for the public examination of any person who -
                        (a) is or has been an officer of the company; or (b) has acted as liquidator
                        or administrator of the company or as receiver or manager … or (c)
                        not being a person falling within paragraph (a) or (b), is or has been
                        concerned, or has taken part, in the promotion, formation or management of
                        the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It was held that this section allowed the
                    court to make an order for public examination against a British director who was
                    resident abroad. In deciding this issue, the court was persuaded by the fact
                    that the policy underlying the statute would be frustrated if it did not extend
                    to directors resident overseas. Peter Gibson J noted (at
                    354F–355B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a company has come to a calamitous end and has been wound up by the
                        court, <em>the obvious intention of this section was that
                            those responsible for the company’s state of affairs should be
                            liable to be subjected to a process of investigation and that
                            investigation should be in public. Parliament could not have intended
                            that a person who had that responsibility could escape liability to
                            investigation simply by not being within the jurisdiction</em>.
                        Indeed, if the section were to be construed as leaving out of its grasp
                        anyone not within the jurisdiction, deliberate evasion by removing oneself
                        out of the jurisdiction would suffice. That seems to me to be a wholly
                        improbable intention to attribute to Parliament. … There is no
                        requirement that an officer of an English company must live in England, nor
                        of course need an officer of an overseas company which may be wound up by
                        the court. Such a company is very likely to have officers not within the
                        jurisdiction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     He went on to distinguish <em>Re Tucker</em> on the following grounds (at 358A–D), among
                    others:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     s 133 of the Insolvency Act 1986 was
                        much narrower in scope than s 25 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 – the
                        former targeted individuals responsible in some way for the management of
                        insolvent companies, while the latter encompassed anyone whom the court
                        suspected might have relevant property or information;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Insolvency
                        Act 1986 did not contain a provision similar to s 25(6) of the Bankruptcy
                        Act 1914 which the court in <em>Re Tucker</em>

                        extraterritoriality which applies to r 71.2 (at [17]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     although a corporate judgment debtor
                        is already subject to the court’s jurisdiction, a foreign officer of

                        [17]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     impracticality of enforcement is a relevant factor in considering whether r
                        71.2 covers officers who are abroad (at [22]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_d"></a>(d)     the public interest in examining the officers of
                        a company being wound up, which was cited as a justification for the
                        decision in <em>Re Seagull</em>, is absent in private
                        civil litigation (at [23]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_e"></a>(e)     the public interest in obtaining evidence for trial is at
                        least as important as the public interest in enforcing a judgment, yet
                        parties have no right to summon witnesses from abroad for that purpose (at
                        [23]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        court’s power to examine company officers under r 71.2 is derived
                        from an amendment to the English Rules of the Supreme Court in 1883, and the
                        Rules Committee in 1883 was likely to have been focusing on domestic
                        judgments and domestically based officers (at [24]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_g"></a>(g)     the extreme informality of the process
                        prescribed by r 71.2 –under which an application for an EJD order
                        may be made without notice, dealt with ministerially by a court officer, and
                        issued automatically – points to a domestic focus (at [24]);

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Since <em>Masri</em>,
                    there have been other English decisions dealing with the issue of
                    extraterritorial jurisdiction. In <em>Serious Organised Crime
                        Agency v Perry and others (Nos 1 and 2)</em> [2013] 1 AC 182
                        (“<em>Perry</em>”), P was convicted in
                    Israel of a number of fraud offences. The Serious Organised Crime Agency
                    obtained a disclosure order under s 357 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c 29)
                    (UK) against P, his wife and his two daughters, none of whom was resident or
                    domiciled in the jurisdiction. The relevant portions of s 357 provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    A disclosure order
                            is an order authorising an appropriate officer to give to <em>any person the appropriate officer considers has relevant
                                information</em> notice in writing requiring him to do, with
                            respect to any matter relevant to the investigation for the purposes of
                            which the order is sought, any or all of the following

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    answer questions, either at a time specified

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    produce documents, or documents of a
                                description, specified in the notice, either at or by a time so
                                specified or at once, and in a manner so specified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Relevant information is information (whether or
                            not contained in a document) which the appropriate officer concerned
                            considers to be relevant to the investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Section 359(1) further provided that a person
                    commits an offence if without reasonable excuse he fails to comply with a
                    requirement imposed on him under a disclosure order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Upon an application to set aside the
                    information notices, a nine-member panel of the UK Supreme Court unanimously
                    held that s 357 could not be invoked against persons out of jurisdiction
                    (although they differed on another issue which is not pertinent here). Lord
                    Phillips of Worth Matravers PSC explained the court’s decision as follows
                    (at [94]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The point is a very short one. No authority is required under English law
                        for a person to request information from another person anywhere in the
                        world. But section 357 authorises orders for requests for information with
                        which the recipient is obliged to comply, subject to penal sanction.
                            <em>Subject to limited exceptions, it is contrary to
                            international law for country A to purport to make criminal conduct in
                            country B committed by persons who are not citizens of country
                            A</em>. Section 357, read with section 359, does not simply make
                        proscribed conduct a criminal offence. It confers on a United Kingdom public
                        authority the power to impose on persons positive obligations to provide
                        information subject to criminal sanction in the event of non-compliance.
                            <em>To confer such authority in respect of persons
                            outside the jurisdiction would be a particularly startling breach of
                            international law</em>. For this reason alone I consider it
                        implicit that the authority given under section 357 can only be exercised in
                        respect of persons who are within the jurisdiction. [emphasis added]</p>

                        <em>could</em> be issued against company officers
                    resident abroad. He reasoned that without such a power, the court’s
                    ability to deal with contempt of its orders by companies with foreign directors
                    and officers would be much reduced, and the efficacy of many worldwide freezing
                    orders and anti-suit injunctions would be compromised (at [24]). <em>Masri</em> was distinguished on the basis that contempt
                    proceedings engage a public interest that is more specific and goes beyond the
                    public interest in enforcing a private civil judgment (at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is evident from the foregoing discussion
                    that the English cases do not appear to speak with one voice. Of the six cases
                    that we have considered, the English courts had declined to read a provision as
                    having extraterritorial reach in four of them –
                    <em>Mackinnon</em>, <em>Re
                    Tucker</em>, <em>Masri</em> and <em>Perry</em>. Putting <em>Masri</em> aside, one
                    key characteristic that cuts across the other three decisions is that they all
                    dealt with provisions that allowed the court to summon individuals unrelated to
                    the parties to the suit on the sole basis that they possessed relevant
                    information. It is understandable why the courts applied the presumption against
                    extraterritoriality strictly in those cases. But it might be useful to delve a
                    little into the significance of that presumption in the specific context of
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Jurisdiction is not a monolithic concept. In
                        <em>Mackinnon</em>, Hoffmann J placed some
                    reliance on a distinction between personal and subject-matter jurisdiction (at
                    493C–F), tracing this to F A Mann’s seminal article, “The
                    Doctrine of Jurisdiction in International Law” in <em>Studies in International Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 1973) ch
                    1 at pp 128–129, where it was stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The mere fact that a State’s judicial or administrative
                        agencies are internationally entitled to subject a person to their personal
                        or ‘curial’ jurisdiction, does not by any means permit them to
                        regulate by their orders such person’s conduct abroad. This they may
                        do only if the State of the forum also has substantive jurisdiction to
                        regulate conduct in the manner defined in the order. In other words, for the
                        purpose of justifying, even in the territory of the forum, the international
                        validity of an order, not only its making, but also its content must be
                        authorized by substantive rules of legislative jurisdiction. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Hoffmann J restated the distinction as
                    follows: personal jurisdiction refers to the question of whether a person is
                    amenable to the jurisdiction of the court in the sense that he is or can be
                    brought before it. This would typically be the case where the person is situated
                    within the forum. Subject-matter jurisdiction (or what Dr Mann referred to as
                    “substantive jurisdiction”) on the other hand refers to what a
                    court is permitted to do in terms of regulating the conduct in another country
                    of someone over whom it has personal jurisdiction. This was how Hoffmann J put
                    it when rejecting the argument that because the bank targeted by the order
                    (Citibank in that case) was present within the jurisdiction of the court through
                    a branch located in England, an order could be made requiring it to produce
                    documents that were situated in another country (namely, the United States) (at
                    493C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that this argument confuses personal jurisdiction, i.e., who can
                        be brought before the court, with subject matter jurisdiction, i.e., to what
                        extent the court can claim to regulate the conduct of those persons. It does
                        not follow from the fact that a person is within the jurisdiction and liable
                        to be served with process that there is no territorial limit to the matters
                        upon which the court may properly apply its own rules or the things which it
                        can order such a person to do. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Hoffmann J held that he was not entitled on
                    the facts before him to order Citibank to produce documents which were located
                    elsewhere and concerned business transacted there. To do otherwise would entail
                    an English court demanding that a foreign national be subject to its orders in
                    respect of what it does in another country. Hoffmann J considered the true
                    principle to be that “a state should refrain from demanding obedience to
                    its sovereign authority by foreigners in respect of their conduct outside the
                    jurisdiction” (at 493G–H), though it does not appear from the
                    judgment that he thought this was an absolute bar; rather he seems to have seen
                    it as a presumptive restraint that is imposed by a court upon itself which might
                    be capable of being displaced in the appropriate circumstances. Seen in this
                    light, the question of subject-matter or substantive jurisdiction is concerned
                    with giving effect to the presumption against extra-territoriality (we
                    henceforth use the term “substantive jurisdiction” to refer to
                    this concept).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Where an EJD order is sought against a foreign
                    officer of a company, whether local or foreign, against whom a judgment has been
                    issued, the anterior question presents the opposite dilemma – the court
                    has the power to require the provision of information relating to the judgment
                    debtor’s property wherever situated, but does not have personal
                    jurisdiction over the foreign officer in question. Whether the court <em>should</em> exercise personal jurisdiction over the foreign
                    officer is the issue, but in coming to a decision on this it seems inevitable
                    that it should also have regard to whether this is merely the prelude to the
                    impermissible exercise of exorbitant substantive jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The dichotomy between personal and substantive
                    jurisdiction appears to have been alluded to again in <em>Masri</em>, though perhaps in somewhat less explicit terms. We think
                    that Lord Mance was in fact considering the question of whether, and if so in
                    what circumstances, the English courts had the substantive jurisdiction to make
                    EJD orders against corporate officers resident abroad; and if they did have it,
                    whether they would exercise it. This is suggested by the following remarks at
                    [18]–[19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    In Mr Rabinowitz’s submission the key to the
                            scope of CPR Pt 71 lies in a recognition of the English court’s
                                <em>jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
                                action</em> (including the judgment) against CCIC and the
                            close connection between that subject matter and Mr Khoury, who was
                            CCIC’s chairman, general manager and director. In <em>The Ikarian Reefer (No 2)</em> [2000] 1 WLR
                            603 it was the existence of substantive proceedings over which the
                            court had jurisdiction and of “a substantial connection with
                            those proceedings by a non-party” that Waller LJ stressed in his
                            judgment as the key to understanding the circumstances in which orders
                            for costs would be made against such a non-party: pp 611<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</font>–612<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">b</font>. Mr Rabinowitz took this as a useful analogy and found
                            direct support for his submission in Professor Brownlie’s
                            identification in <em>Principles of Public
                                International Law</em>, 7th ed (2008), p 311 of one criterion
                            of jurisdiction as “a substantial and bona fide connection
                            between the subject matter and the source of the jurisdiction”
                            (to which however Professor Brownlie added, at p 312, that “the
                            principle of non-intervention in the domestic or territorial
                            jurisdiction of other states should be observed”). Mr Rabinowitz
                            also relied on the statement by Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts
                                in <em>Oppenheim’s International
                                Law</em>, 9th ed (1992) vol 1, pp 457–458 that there
                            must be “a sufficiently close connection to justify th[e] state
                            in regulating the matter and perhaps also to override any competing
                            rights of other states”.</p>

                            the grasp and intendment of, the relevant legislation or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In contrast, in both <em>Re
                        Seagull</em> and <em>Dar Al Akan</em> the courts
                    held that they could make orders affecting parties abroad. <em>Re
                        Seagull</em> was decided on the basis that it would frustrate the
                    policy of the insolvency legislation if those who were running the company at
                    and perhaps to its “calamitous end” could put themselves beyond
                    the reach of the courts and of the investigative processes contemplated by the
                    legislation by leaving the jurisdiction. Peter Gibson J distinguished <em>Re Tucker</em> on the basis of differences between the
                    applicable statutes in the two cases. But a focus on the distinction between
                    personal and substantive jurisdiction might have presented an alternative
                    solution. In <em>Re Seagull</em>, the director in question
                    was a British citizen and it is less obvious that the concern that had been
                    articulated by Hoffmann J in <em>Mackinnon</em> over the
                    court finding substantive jurisdiction in such a case would have been
                    implicated, since the interest of a state in regulating the conduct of <em>its own nationals</em> even abroad might be more readily
                    recognised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As for <em>Dar Al
                        Arkan</em>, the litigant there was a foreign company which was
                    required by the order of the court to do certain things, and the question was
                    whether this should be extended by permitting a committal order to be made
                    against the non-resident officers of the company. Having established that the
                    corporate litigant was properly before the court, there can be no basis for
                    suggesting that <em>it</em> was not then amenable to the
                    substantive jurisdiction of the court when it came to enforcement of the
                    court’s order. The court was undoubtedly competent to make the orders for
                    enforcement – whether these could be carried into effect elsewhere would
                    depend on the state of the law in that jurisdiction as well as on provisions
                    that might have been in place for reciprocal enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It is true that the extension to the directors
                    and officers of the corporate litigant took the matter a step further. But
                    companies can only act through individuals, and the only way a court can exert
                    control over companies would be to issue orders – whether directly or
                    indirectly ­– against those individuals who act on its
                    behalf and who are able to effect the corporate litigant’s compliance with
                    the orders of the court. If a court was not able to issue orders against such
                    foreign officers, then they would not have the means to control foreign
                    companies which are legitimately within its personal and substantive
                    jurisdiction. This would be a surprising result and one we are unwilling to
                    reach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We of course recognise the force of Lord
                    Mance’s concerns regarding the imposition of extraterritorial jurisdiction
                    on company officers who are not parties to the proceedings. But his concerns
                    must be understood in the context of the English equivalents to O 11 (rr 6.30(2)
                    and 6.20(9) of the CPR), which do not allow EJD orders to be <em>served</em> out of jurisdiction. This lack of personal jurisdiction
                    fortified his conclusion that Pt 71 of the CPR did not confer the requisite
                    substantive jurisdiction on the court to regulate the conduct of foreign
                    officers (at [37]). The civil procedure rules in Singapore are different, and on
                    the basis that the power exists to issue an EJD order out of the jurisdiction
                    against the director or officer of a corporate litigant, Lord Mance’s
                    concerns can be addressed by the court when it comes to consider whether it will
                        <em>exercise</em> its power and permit a party to
                    proceed against the foreign directors or officers of a corporate litigant. This
                    is a matter that arises at the leave stage (which we address below at
                    [110]–[115]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Against those observations we return to the
                    issue of how O 48 r 1 should be interpreted. We first observe that there
                        <em>are</em> key differences between r 71.2 of the CPR
                    and O 48 r 1 of the ROC. The “extreme informality” in r 71.2
                    that troubled Lord Mance is not present in O 48 r 1:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     While r 71.2(4) expressly allows an
                        application for an EJD order to be dealt with without a hearing, an EJD
                        application under O 48 r 1 requires an <em>ex
                            parte</em> hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     While r 71.2(5) mandates that an EJD order <em>will</em> be issued if the procedural requirements are
                        satisfied, O 48 r 1 gives our courts the discretion <em>not</em> to issue an EJD order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     These differences alone would give us reason
                    to pause before applying the holding in <em>Masri</em> to O
                    48 r 1. In addition, however, we find ourselves respectfully unable to agree
                    with some aspects of the decision in <em>Masri</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     First, the Directors argue that since O 48 r 1
                    of our ROC and r 71.2 of the English CPR share a common ancestry, Lord
                    Mance’s observations regarding the likely domestic focus of the Rules
                    Committee in 1883 (see [72(f)] above) apply with equal force to O 48 r 1. But
                    the fact that the rule-maker did not consider whether a rule would apply in a
                    particular situation (even though the language of the rule might be wide enough
                    to cover that situation) does not, without more, supply a basis for excluding it
                    from the ambit of the rule. Instead, under s 9A of the Interpretation Act
                    (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), the proper approach is to consider the object of the
                    rule and then decide whether its object would be promoted if it were interpreted
                    to cover the situation at hand. Here, there is no serious doubt that the
                    underlying purpose of O 48 r 1, which is to enable judgment creditors to obtain
                    information about a corporate judgment debtor’s finances, would be served
                    by extending it to foreign officers. The real question is whether we should
                    nonetheless impose limits on its application and if so, how we should do
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Second, we do not think that the public
                    interest analysis used in <em>Masri</em> provides a
                    sustainable basis for deciding which laws should be interpreted as having
                    extraterritorial effect, and which not. To begin with, there is no inherent
                    reason why extraterritorial jurisdiction would be more readily conferred by a
                    written law when public interests, as opposed to private interests, are at
                    stake. After all, virtually all penal statutes may be said to implicate public
                    interests, yet the presumption against extraterritoriality applies with
                    particular force to criminal law. Furthermore, no justification was given in
                        <em>Masri</em> as to why the public interest in
                    ensuring that the court’s judgments do not go unsatisfied is any less
                    compelling than the public interest in ensuring the orderly winding up of a
                    company. After all, the main purpose of both winding up proceedings and EJD
                    proceedings is to benefit the company’s creditors. Hence, the mere fact
                    that one set of proceedings might be described as “public”, and
                    the other “private”, does not provide a principled basis for
                    distinguishing between the two. Lord Mance himself seemed to appreciate the
                    slippery nature of the public/private distinction when he granted that “a
                    fair and efficient legal system is of course a cornerstone of the rule of law,
                    and … there is a public interest in a court getting to the bottom of
                    litigation and ensuring that parties have the means of obtaining full
                    information to enable it to do so” (at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Third, as we have noted, the holding in
                        <em>Masri</em> that r 71.2 did not apply to foreign
                    officers was fortified by the court’s view that English civil procedure
                    did not allow an EJD order to be served on a company officer out of
                    jurisdiction. But as we will explain shortly, this is not the position under
                    Singapore law – in our judgment, an EJD order may be served out of
                    jurisdiction on a foreign officer with the leave of the court (see
                    [95]–[109] below). Thus, any concerns relating to the imposition of
                    extraterritorial jurisdiction on a foreign officer can be considered and
                    addressed at the stage where leave is sought to serve an EJD order
                    abroad.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Indeed, in our judgment, <em>service</em> is the crucial act that engages the court’s
                    jurisdiction over a foreign person. As a matter of Singapore law, personal
                    jurisdiction may be found when the putative defendant is physically within the
                    jurisdiction at the time the writ is served on him (see s 16(1) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed)) or when the requirements
                    stipulated in O 11 of the ROC have been met and leave has been given for a writ
                    to be served on a defendant not physically within the confines of Singapore.
                    Further, as Lord Diplock said in <em>Amin Rasheed Corporation v
                        Kuwait Insurance Co</em> [1984] 1 AC 50 (at 65–66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, <em>the jurisdiction exercised by an English
                            court over a foreign corporation which has no place of business in this
                            country</em>, <b><em>as a result of granting leave
                            under R.S.C., Ord. 11, r. 1 (1) (f) for service out of the jurisdiction
                            </em></b><em>of a writ on that corporation, is an
                            exorbitant jurisdiction</em>, i.e., it is one which, under general
                        English conflict rules, an English court would not recognise as possessed by
                        any foreign court in the absence of some treaty providing for such
                        recognition. Comity thus dictates that the judicial discretion to grant
                        leave under this paragraph of R.S.C., Ord. 11, r. 1 (1) should be exercised
                        with circumspection in cases where there exists an alternative forum
                        … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     To hold that there is an absolute prohibition
                    on the issuance of EJD orders against foreign officers would go too far because
                    it is entirely conceivable for such an order to be served within the
                    jurisdiction when the officer comes to Singapore for a temporary visit. Even an
                    originating process may be validly served in this manner (<em>HRH
                        Maharanee Seethaderi Gaekwar of Baroda v Wildenstein</em> [1972] 2 QB
                    283 at 292). But whether the EJD Order may be served <em>out of
                        jurisdiction</em> is an entirely separate matter, and it is at that
                    stage that the court may weigh the competing considerations. We have also
                    alluded to our views on the question of leave and to that issue we now
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Leave Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is leave required to serve an EJD order out of
                jurisdiction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The rule governing the service of summons,
                    notices and orders out of jurisdiction is O 11 r 8(1), which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Order 69, Rule 10, service out of Singapore of any summons,
                        notice or order issued, given or made in any proceedings is permissible only
                        with the leave of the Court <em>but leave shall not be
                            required in any proceedings in which leave for service of the
                            originating process has already been granted</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Invoking this rule, Transocean submits that there is no need
                        to obtain leave to serve the EJD Orders out of the jurisdiction since leave
                        to serve the writ of summons out of jurisdiction had already been
                        granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Directors, on the other hand, submit that
                    O 11 r 8(1) does not apply where an order is sought to be served out of
                    jurisdiction on a foreign individual who is <em>not</em> a
                    party to the proceedings. In support of this proposition, they rely on the
                    decision of the English High Court in <em>Vitol</em>, which
                    dealt with whether leave may be granted to serve an EJD order out of
                    jurisdiction under r 6.30(2) of the CPR. Rule 6.30(2) (which has since been
                    amended and is now found in r 6.38(1)) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless paragraph (3) applies, where the permission of the court is
                        required for a claim form served out of the jurisdiction the permission of
                        the court must also be obtained for service out of the jurisdiction of any
                        other document to be served in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     We pause to make the observation that unlike
                    the holding in <em>Vitol</em>, which was subsequently
                    applied in <em>Masri</em>, we have already held that leave
                    to serve an EJD order out of jurisdiction may be granted under our ROC; but the
                    discussion is helpful for the focus it brings to the question of whether and in
                    what circumstances it may be permissible to ignore the distinction in the
                    personalities of the company and its officers. In <em>Vitol</em>, in coming to his conclusion that the court had no
                    jurisdiction to grant the leave requested, Tomlinson J reasoned as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    … I do not consider that CPR 6.30(2)
                            provides the court with machinery pursuant to which it may permit
                            service out of the jurisdiction of an order made under CPR 71.2(1)(b).
                            …
                            <em>That provision is I think concerned with documents
                                which require to be served on parties to the proceedings.</em>
                            Furthermore, as Aikens J pointed out in <em>C. Inc. plc
                                v. L.</em> [2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 446, CPR 6.30(2) itself
                            requires the identification of a ground within CPR 6.20 which gives the
                            court power to grant permission to serve out of the jurisdiction the
                            document service of which is sought to be effected
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    That being so, the question arises on what basis
                            the court can assume an exorbitant jurisdiction to permit service of
                            such an order out of the jurisdiction? The closest analogy is a witness
                            summons issued under CPR 34.2, which, in the language of that rule,
                            “is a document issued by the court requiring a witness to (a)
                            attend court to give evidence or (b) produce documents to the
                            court.” It is axiomatic that a party cannot compel a witness in a
                            foreign country to attend a trial in England and Wales
                        …</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    Both Hirst LJ and Peter Gibson J in [<em>Re Seagull</em>] emphasised that what the court was
                            there concerned with was ascertaining who came within the legislative
                            grasp or intendment of the section. The efficient and thorough conduct
                            of an investigation into the affairs of a failed company pointed to an
                            overriding public interest. No such public interest is engaged where
                            what is under consideration is the enforcement of private law
                            obligations which may have little or no connection with the English
                            jurisdiction. I do not consider that the decision of the Court of Appeal
                            in [<em>Re Seagull</em>] provides any justification
                            for holding that an order made under CPR 71.2(1)(b) may be served out of
                            the jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The decision in <em>Vitol</em> may be contrasted with the earlier decision in <em>National Justice Compania Naviera SA v Prudential Assurance Co Ltd
                        (No 2)</em> [2000] 1 WLR 603 (“<em>The Ikarian
                        Reefer</em>”), where costs were ordered against the
                    unsuccessful plaintiff in favour of the defendant. Seeking to hold the director
                    of the plaintiff liable for costs, the defendant issued a summons in the action
                    against him and served it on him out of jurisdiction without prior leave. The
                    English Court of Appeal held that leave was required to serve the summons out of
                    jurisdiction, but upheld the retrospective granting of leave by the judge below.
                    In the process, the court considered the scope of O 11 r 9(4) of the Rules
                    of the Supreme Court (UK) then in force, which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Service out of the jurisdiction of any summons, notice or order issued,
                        given or made in any proceedings is permissible with the leave of the court
                        but leave shall not be required for such service in any proceedings in which
                        the writ, originating summons, motion or petition may by these rules or
                        under any Act be served out of the jurisdiction without leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Waller LJ held that this provision allowed
                    leave to be granted for service of the summons out of jurisdiction, even though
                    the director was not a party to the proceedings. He reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where there is an action pending before the English court, then a
                        summons in that action can be served on a person domiciled and resident
                        outside the jurisdiction. I appreciate that in [<em>Mansour v
                            Mansour</em> [1989] 1 FLR 418] the party being served was a party
                        to the proceedings. But that was not the basis of Sir John Donaldson M.R.'s
                        reasoning and I venture to think that if a non-party committed a contempt of
                        the English court the fact that that non-party was outside the jurisdiction
                        physically would not prevent the English court having jurisdiction to
                        proceed to commit for contempt. By analogy, as it seems to me, unless by
                        some Convention the United Kingdom has agreed that its courts would not
                        exercise a jurisdiction, <em>the English court has
                            jurisdiction to decide the issue whether a non-party has taken such
                            steps in relation to an action as should render that person liable to
                            pay the costs of that action.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In <em>Masri</em>, Lord
                    Mance agreed with Tomlinson J’s view in <em>Vitol</em> that r 6.30(2) of the CPR did not permit leave to be
                    granted for service out of jurisdiction on non-parties (at [36]). He
                    distinguished <em>The Ikarian Reefer</em> on the basis that
                    it was a special case where the director on whom the summons was sought to be
                    served out of jurisdiction was the <em>alter ego</em> of
                    the plaintiff company whose proceedings he had instigated, controlled and
                    financed (at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The decisions in <em>The
                        Ikarian Reefer</em> and <em>Masri</em> were
                    considered by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands in <em>CIGNA
                        Worldwide Insurance Company (by and through its court-appointed receiver,
                        Josie Senesie, and in respect of the assets undertaking and affairs of its
                        licensed Liberian branch and business) v ACE Limited</em> (unreported,
                    13 May 2013). The issue in that case was whether the court had jurisdiction to
                    grant leave to serve a costs summons on a non-party out of jurisdiction under O
                    11 r 9(2) of the Grand Court Rules 1995 (Revised Edition) (Cayman Islands),
                    which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Service out of the jurisdiction of any summons, notice or order issued,
                        given or made in any proceedings is permissible with the leave of the Court,
                        but leave shall not be required for such service in any proceedings in which
                        the writ, originating summons, motion or petition may by these Rules or
                        under any Law be served without leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Considering both <em>The
                        Ikarian Reefer</em> and <em>Masri</em>, Cresswell
                    J held that the court might have such jurisdiction in a case where the non-party
                    had instigated, controlled and financed the proceedings brought in the name of
                    the company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle underlying the jurisdiction (so far as relevant) under GCR O
                        11 r 9(2) to be derived from <em>Masri</em> is that
                            <em>where a person (B) instigates, controls and finances
                            proceedings brought in the name of A, there may be circumstances in
                            which it is legitimate to assimilate the party A and the non-party B,
                            and to treat any means of service available against A, as available also
                            against B.</em> This is so where B in reality brought the main
                        proceedings and there has in effect been a submission to the jurisdiction by
                        B. I derive this principle from paragraph 33 of Lord Mance’s opinion.
                        Although the expression alter ego may be used to describe B’s
                        relationship with A, I do not read Lord Mance in <em>Masri</em> as confining the use of GCR O 11 r 9(2) to the alter
                        ego of a one ship Panamanian company. Lord Mance plainly regarded the type
                        of case that would fall within the principle as narrow, but he was not
                        concerned in <em>Masri</em> to examine the extent of
                        the circumstances in which it might be legitimate to assimilate the party A
                        and the non-party B, because an application for an order under CPR r 71.2
                        plainly did not fall within the principle or CPR r 6.30(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not accept Mr Hubble’s submissions to the extent that he seeks
                        to narrow the limited jurisdiction further by confining it to the case of an
                        alter ego or the alter ego of a one ship Panamanian Company [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Against that background, we turn to the
                    position in Singapore. O 11 r 8(1) in its current form came into force
                    on 1 February 1992 (see Rules of the Supreme Court (Amendment No 3) Rules 1991
                    (S 532/1991)). Before 1992, the equivalent provision was O 11 r 9(4) of the
                    Rules of the Supreme Court 1970, which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Service out of jurisdiction of any summons, notice or order issued, given
                        or made in any proceedings is permissible with the leave of the
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The question is whether the addition of the
                    clause “but leave shall not be required in any proceedings in which leave
                    for service of the originating process has already been granted”
                    (“the 1991 Amendment”) was intended to allow a party to serve
                    summonses, notices or orders out of jurisdiction without first obtaining leave
                    specifically to serve process on <em>non-parties</em>, even
                    if it related to substantive proceedings for which leave to serve on the parties
                    had already been obtained. If so, this would have far-reaching effects that
                    extend beyond the EJD context. For example, O 11 r 8(1) would also allow parties
                    to serve an order for discovery or interrogatories against non-parties (see
                    O 24 r 6(2) and O 26A r 1(2) respectively) out of jurisdiction without
                    leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    We do not think that this could have been
                    the intention of the Rules Committee. The 1991 Amendment must be understood in
                    the light of its purpose. Between 1991 and 1993, our civil procedure rules
                    underwent a raft of reforms aimed at expediting court processes, increasing
                    efficiency and reducing the backlog of cases that had accumulated in the
                    preceding years (see Jeffrey Pinsler, “Reforms in Civil Procedure: An
                    Analysis of the Amendments to the Rules of Court” in <em>Review of Judicial and Legal Reforms in Singapore between 1990 and
                        1995</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1996) at pp 12 and 79). Given this
                    backdrop, it seems to us that the rationale underlying the 1991 Amendment was to
                    eliminate duplicative applications for leave – where leave to serve the
                    originating process on a defendant abroad had already been granted, the issue of
                    whether this was an appropriate case to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction
                    over <em>that particular defendant</em> would have already
                    been considered, and it would be unnecessary and inefficient to require leave to
                    be sought repeatedly for overseas service of every subsequent document in the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    However, this rationale does not apply to a
                        <em>non-party</em> to the proceedings, in relation to
                    whom the basis for exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction has yet to be
                    established. Transocean’s argument – that any concerns about
                    extraterritoriality would have already been addressed when leave for service
                    abroad of the originating process had been obtained – is not correct,
                    because such leave would have been granted by the court on the basis that the
                    defendant identified in the leave application was a party to a claim that was
                    sufficiently connected to Singapore. Different considerations would apply in
                    relation to an individual who is not a party to the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Consequently, adopting a purposive
                    interpretation of O 11 r 8(1), we hold that it does <em>not</em> dispense with the need for leave where a summons, notice or
                    order is sought to be served out of jurisdiction on a non-party. In our
                    judgment, the phrase “any proceedings in which leave for service of the
                    originating process has already been granted” requires the court to
                    consider what leave had already been granted in those proceedings and, in
                    particular, the persons in respect of whom such leave has been granted. If leave
                    for overseas service had not previously been granted in respect of an individual
                    or entity that is not a party to the suit, then leave would need to be sought
                    afresh under O 11 r 8(1) for service out of the jurisdiction on that
                    individual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    To overcome this distinction between parties
                    and non-parties, Transocean contends that company officers should not be
                    considered non-parties for the purposes of EJD orders because such orders are
                    directed to them in their capacity as officers of the judgment debtor; they are
                    simply the personification of the judgment debtor for the purposes of EJD
                    proceedings. But we are unable to see how we can ignore the separate legal
                    personality of company officers when the EJD orders are addressed to them
                        <em>personally</em>, with penal consequences for them
                        <em>personally</em> if they do not comply. Unless there
                    is evidence that the officer in question is in fact the <em>alter
                        ego</em> of the company (as was the case in <em>The
                        Ikarian Reefer</em>) or possibly where there is clear evidence that
                    the officer in question “instigates, controls and finances” the
                    litigation brought in the name of the corporate party to such a degree that it
                    would be unjust to allow him to rely upon the separate corporate personality,
                    any attempt to characterise company officers as parties to the proceedings would
                    be untenable. There was no question of any such exception availing in this
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Thus, we hold that Transocean must apply for
                    leave in order to serve the EJD Orders out of jurisdiction on the Directors, and
                    this requirement cannot be circumvented by applying for leave to effect
                    substituted service of the EJD Orders on Burgundy’s lawyers in Singapore
                    as was done in this instance. The question then is whether leave should
                    retrospectively be granted to Transocean.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Should leave be granted to Transocean to serve the EJD Orders out of
                jurisdiction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    We accept that in principle, leave to serve
                    a summons, order or notice out of jurisdiction can be granted retrospectively
                    (as was done in <em>The Ikarian Reefer</em>). This stems
                    from the court’s power under O 2 r 1(2) to “make such order
                    … dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit” where
                    there has been a failure to comply with the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In our judgment, however, the discretion to
                    grant leave to serve an EJD order out of jurisdiction is one that must be
                    exercised sparingly. As we noted in <em>PT Bakrie Investindo v
                        Global Distressed Alpha Fund 1 Ltd Partnership</em> [2013] 4 SLR 1116
                    at [16], the predominant purpose of an EJD order is to obtain information to
                    assist the judgment creditor in executing his judgment. In this respect it is
                    very similar to a subpoena – both are orders directed at persons who might
                    not necessarily be parties to the suit requiring them to provide relevant
                    information to the court. Both are equally intrusive in that they generally
                    require the person against whom the order is made to attend court personally. We
                    note that under O 38 r 16(2), a person served with a subpoena to produce
                    documents could sufficiently comply by causing the documents to be produced
                    without attending personally; no such option exists in the ROC for a person
                    served with an EJD order. We also return here to the observation we have made at
                    [82] above, which is that even though the application for leave might appear to
                    be one that is directed at invoking the court’s personal jurisdiction over
                    the non-party in question, that is only anterior to the further question of
                    whether this will ultimately entail the exercise of exorbitant substantive
                    jurisdiction to an impermissible degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Having said that, we do not think it would
                    be appropriate to lay down strict or exhaustive rules as to when a court may
                    exercise its discretion to allow service abroad of an EJD order. The fundamental
                    question is whether the foreign officer is so closely connected to the
                    substantive claim that the Singapore court is justified in taking jurisdiction
                    over him. We nevertheless make two tentative points. First, as the whole point
                    of an EJD order is to obtain information about the judgment debtor’s
                    finances, the extent of the foreign officer’s knowledge of his
                    company’s financial affairs will be an important threshold consideration.
                    Parties should not be allowed to haul before the court a foreign officer who is
                    unlikely to possess any relevant information. But even if a foreign officer has
                    relevant information, that fact alone would generally be insufficient; after
                    all, the same could be said about any individual sought to be subpoenaed to give
                    evidence. Something more would be required. For example, the court might wish to
                    consider the extent of the foreign officer’s involvement in the matters
                    relating to the claim. It might be easier to justify invoking the court’s
                    jurisdiction over a foreign officer who has played a key role in the events
                    giving rise to the judgment creditor’s successful claim. Ultimately, the
                    duty is on the judgment creditor to persuade the court that this is a proper
                    case to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In the present case, there was simply not
                    enough material before us to justify the exercise of our discretion. The only
                    evidence that Transocean referred us to was an affidavit sworn by Mr Rogelio
                    T Serafica (“Mr Serafica”) in support of the
                    Directors’ application to stay the execution of the EJD Orders. The
                    relevant paragraphs state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    I also wish to inform the Honourable Court that
                                <em>apart from myself, none of the other Applicants
                                have any knowledge of the activities and assets of the
                                Company.</em> In addition, the Plaintiff had prior knowledge
                            of the other officers whom they had transacted with our company
                                [<em>sic</em>] during and after the
                            negotiations …. Some names of all of our former officers were
                            clearly mentioned by the Plaintiff’s personnel in their
                            Affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    I thus have reason to believe that the Plaintiff
                            are including the members of my family in the EJD Order knowing fully
                            well that they are not officers who are knowledgable [<em>sic</em>] on the case and transactions. If the Plaintiffs
                            would wish to know the detailed financial position and condition of the
                            company, the correct person to call would be our official external
                            Auditor Mr. Diosdado M. Perez and the current finance officer Ms. Rowena
                            C. Borja.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Relying on Mr Serafica’s statement that “apart
                        from himself”, none of the Directors have any knowledge of the
                        company’s activities and assets, Transocean argued that leave should
                        be granted at least with respect to Mr Serafica.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In the first place, we do not consider it
                    legitimate for Transocean to rely on this affidavit of Mr Serafica, which was
                    filed <em>after</em> Transocean was (wrongly) granted leave
                    to effect substituted service of the EJD Orders. This affidavit would not have
                    been available at the stage where Transocean would have been required to apply
                    for leave to serve the EJD Orders abroad, and Transocean ought not now to be in
                    a position to rely on it in its application for leave to be granted
                    retrospectively. But even if the contents of Mr Serafica’s affidavit
                    were taken into account, we have already noted that the mere fact that an
                    officer has some information about the company’s finances would normally
                    not be sufficient to justify the court’s exercise of its jurisdiction
                    extraterritorially over that officer. No other evidence was provided by
                    Transocean as to why we should exercise our discretion in this case, aside from
                    some assertions by counsel that Mr Serafica had been intimately involved in the
                    initial stages of the proceedings. For these reasons, we do not think that this
                    is a proper case for granting leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Aside from this, we also voice our
                    reservations about allowing Transocean to effect substituted service of the EJD
                    Orders by serving them on <em>Burgundy’s</em> lawyers
                    in Singapore. It seems to us that upholding this novel mode of substituted
                    service could pave the way for parties to use this as a shortcut to serve
                    documents on foreign persons who hold senior positions in a company by serving
                    the documents on the company’s lawyers instead. But we need not decide
                    this point as we set aside the order for substituted service of the EJD Orders
                    on the ground that leave for service out of jurisdiction had not been
                    obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    For the foregoing reasons, CA 48/2013 and CA
                    55/2013 are both allowed. We reduce Transocean’s award of damages to the
                    sum of US$55,001.46 and set aside AR Yeo’s order allowing substituted
                    service of the EJD Orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Burgundy and the Directors shall have their
                    costs here and below and these are to be taxed if not agreed. There will also be
                    the usual consequential orders.</p>
