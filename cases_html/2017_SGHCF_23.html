The Wife is the Plaintiff in these proceedings, and the Husband is the Defendant. Much of the dispute centred on the division of matrimonial assets, which required the determination of many sub-issues relating to the identification of the asset pool. This was overall a 16-year marriage with four children. Parties had married on 23 October 1998. On 4 September 2012, the Wife filed for divorce. On 25 October 2012, she and the children moved out of the family home. Interim judgment was granted on 4 March 2014, some 19 months after the commencement of the divorce suit, on grounds of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The divorce was based on an amended Statement of Particulars, which was accepted by the Husband.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Both parties have since appealed against the orders on ancillary matters that I made on 9 January 2017, in relation to: (a) the delineation, division, and distribution of their assets; (b) maintenance for the Wife; and (c) maintenance for the children.

Firstly, it would be out of character, in this context, where the parties did not have joint assets or a joint account and where the Husband did not even provide the Wife with a supplementary credit card, for him to advance the position that he entrusted her to save some of the monies given to her for his retirement, in which case the savings would have had to be placed in a bank account or invested in her sole name. In any event, the Husband’s “Family Plan” for the Wife to re-join the workforce after his retirement when the family relocated permanently to the UK did not make sense, as the Wife would then be in her late forties and without much recent relevant working experience, let alone working experience in a different environment and country such as the UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Secondly, I observed from the Husband’s relationship with his friends that he was generous with money.

According to her, both parties had expended an average of £8,500 per year over four years to maintain and improve the property. She had herself remitted £5,000 in August 2010, £10,000 in December 2010 and £5,000 in October 2011 from her own bank account to the manager of the property to replace the plumbing and hot water heating system for the entire house, as well as to put in new floorboards for the kitchen.

</div> This, therefore, corroborated the Wife’s position that rather substantial sums of money had to be spent on the property during the marriage for its upkeep and to prevent it from falling into disrepair through lack of use. It was also consistent with the pattern of money transfers which had been made for the purposes of maintaining and improving the property, the last of which was made on 21 January 2013 before the property was rented out in June 2013 and when the rental income would have then been channelled to its upkeep. I was thus satisfied that there was substantial improvement of the Cranbrook property during the marriage within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Women’s Charter. This was not seriously disputed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The real issue was whether the Cranbrook property had been substantially improved by <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Wife’s</span> contributions, for it to properly constitute a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). While I had initially been of the view that the sums used to upkeep the Cranbrook property were ultimately monies that came from the Husband, I have, after further consideration of the issue of inter-spousal gifts, come to the conclusion that the Wife’s remittances would rightly be considered her contributions to the property. As I found above at [11]-[13], the Husband had given the Wife a total sum of about $1.9m in surplus over the course of their marriage, which were meant as gifts to the Wife and which enabled her to accumulate some sizeable savings. It seemed clear to me, as a matter of logic and fairness, that the Wife, in dipping into those savings of her own accord to maintain and substantially improve the Cranbrook property during the marriage, should be given credit for her contributions to the asset. In arriving at my decision, I noted that the Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter </span>[2012] 4 SLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span>”) had previously held that “pure” inter-spousal gifts were matrimonial assets (at [40]-[41]). In other words, “pure” inter-spousal gifts, such as the Husband’s monetary gifts to the Wife in this case, were considered joint assets belonging to both parties <span class="font-italic">upon divorce</span>. Nevertheless, in my view, it would not be inconsistent with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span> to find that the inter-spousal gifts were assets that properly belonged to the recipient spouse <span class="font-italic">before the dissolution of the marriage</span>. Indeed, this distinction drawn between the pre- and post-divorce state of affairs would not be inconsistent with the “deferred community of  property” approach in our legislation, under which the concept that both spouses have a joint interest in the matrimonial asset does not take place until the marriage is legally terminated (see <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 at [40], citing Leong Wai Kum, <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 11 (LexisNexis, 2016) at para 130.751). I thus considered that the Wife’s remittances to maintain and improve the Cranbrook property in this case were drawn from what would rightly be considered her personal funds, which the Wife had saved up from the Husband’s monetary gifts to her, and should be regarded as <span class="font-italic">her </span>contributions to the property. On this basis, I found that since the Wife had expended significant sums to maintain and improve the Cranbrook property, and had assisted the Husband in administering the property from Singapore, there was enough to attribute the substantial improvement of the asset during the marriage to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the circumstances, I was of the view that the Cranbrook property fell within the definition of a “matrimonial asset” under s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. Having determined that it was to be included in the matrimonial pool for division, I obtained a valuation of the property by averaging the figures proffered by each party.

For the sake of clarity, there were two aspects to the Husband’s case. First, all of the Husband’s assets in the UK were pre-marital assets; any new creation of bank accounts in the UK and movements of monies in and out of his UK bank accounts were simply intra-UK transfers of these pre-marital assets and thus none of these funds were matrimonial assets.

</div> and that at least some of the funds in the Main Barclays Account at the time of the proceedings had in fact been accumulated during the marriage from the Husband’s share dividends. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Husband insisted that the funds in the Main Barclays Account were pre-marital assets. He also insisted that his DBS bank statements all the way from February 1999 showed that there had been no telegraphic transfers of monies from that account to fund his UK assets, although, as noted earlier, the Wife disputed this. According to the Husband, the funds in the Main Barclays Account thus could not have come from income generated during the marriage. The Wife’s assertion otherwise was tantamount to absurd suggestion that he had brought “bags of cash” to the UK during the marriage to effect the transfers. This was highly improbable because of capital controls limiting the physical movement of funds across borders. The reality was that very few people actually retained their bank statements over a prolonged period of time and it was impractical to expect him to produce all his bank statements for an account that has been opened in 1979. It was “purely by a stroke of good fortune” that DBS had kept his statements since 1999,

</div> albeit he had to pay DBS for them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my judgment, the Husband’s “ring-fencing” argument was not persuasive. Instead of attempting to show that the funds consisted entirely of pre-marital assets because there had been no outflow of funds from his DBS account, he could have shown that there had been no significant inflow of funds into the Main Barclays Account at least for the later part of the marriage, when bank records would have been available to show or negative a possible pattern. The fact that the account had been opened a long time ago may explain why some bank statements could not be located, but it did not absolve him of all evidential burden.  In any event, the Husband had not provided <span class="font-italic">any</span> statements on the Main Barclays Account before or after the marriage. He also did not explain why he could not have produced at least <span class="font-italic">some</span> bank statements for the relevant period, which might have persuaded me to give him the benefit of the doubt. Furthermore, despite his claims of the difficulties in producing bank statements, he was nonetheless able to produce other correspondence from Barclays Bank, including the 8 August 2003 letter which was issued nearly fourteen years ago, to support his argument that most of his bank accounts were set up after that date simply to receive his pre-marital funds in the UK and reduce his tax liability for interest payments on those funds.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I was thus of the view that the $389,561.32 in the Main Barclays Account should be added to the asset pool. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of $389,561.32 did not include the monies from the sale of the Transglobe Shares, which were still being held by the Husband’s HSBC brokers although they had been instructed to transfer those funds into the Main Barclays Account (see above at [36]).

If the account had indeed been closed on 19 September 2012, it would appear that he had chosen to close it very shortly after the Wife served the divorce writ on him on 8 September 2012. The assertion that he had closed this account on 19 September 2012 was also inconsistent with his declaration in his earlier affidavit of 27 August 2014 where, in response to the Wife’s interrogatories, he stated that he had not closed any of his bank accounts since January 2011.

</div> In any event, there was no evidence of when the account was first opened or that the funds came from his pre-marital assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Husband complained that he was at a disadvantage because the Wife had sole control over the P.O. Box, to which most of the documents and correspondence on his bank accounts were sent. When she left home in October 2012, she took the key to the P.O. Box with her and returned it to him only in January 2013. There had been no mention in her affidavits as to what she did with the documents that were sent to the P.O. Box between October 2012 and January 2013. The suggestion by the Husband, it appeared, was that information on the account closure could have been lost in the intervening period. The Husband also argued that the Wife had always been more familiar than he was with his offshore accounts and investments because she was in charge of them and kept spreadsheets to monitor them. Presumably, the argument was that this impaired his ability to provide the relevant information to the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I was not convinced by the Husband’s argument on this front. Even if it was true that he did not have full access to the documents sent to his home, he should, as an experienced professional auditor, be well-placed to pursue other options to obtain relevant information on his assets. In any event, it appeared that the Wife had provided him with the relevant records of his investments sometime around January 2013,

</div> which he used to support his claim that he had transferred monies directly to the NatWest Account himself.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I found that the monies in the NatWest Account were matrimonial assets. Whether they were gifts from the Husband to the Wife or direct transfers from the Husband, the point was that these monies came from the Husband’s employment earnings during the course of the marriage.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The parties’ arguments were thus peripheral to the outcome of my decision. For completeness, however, I state my views briefly on the issues which occupied a large part of parties’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Firstly, while I was prepared to accept that the Husband had transferred £10,000 from his Singapore DBS account to his UK NatWest Account for the upkeep of the Cranbrook property in 2013, I found it odd, and indeed quite inexplicable, that the Husband produced all the relevant NatWest bank statements save for the one bank statement in January 2013 which would have conclusively proven the £10,000 remittance in January 2013. As there was no January 2013 bank statement to show the £10,000 remittance from his DBS account, his counsel sought to reconcile, in some detail, the bank account figures based on the preceding and subsequent bank statements to show that the ending balance in the account reflected the £10,000 deposit minus the usual maintenance expenses.

</div>
</div> These attempts to reconcile the figures pre- and post-remittance were not the subject of any affidavits by the Husband but were representations from the Bar. My acceptance of his claim on this point was therefore not without reservations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Secondly, I did not agree with the Husband that the Wife’s remittances should not be recognised as her contributions to the NatWest Account. Since the monies remitted were essentially gifts to the Wife in the context of an ongoing marriage at the time, the Wife would have had some discretion as to how she wished to use the funds. In the circumstances, I considered that the Wife should be given some credit for having saved up some of these monies and eventually applying them to the NatWest Account for the upkeep of the Cranbrook property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Concluding observations on the Husband’s alleged pre-marital assets</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I wish to conclude my discussion on the Husband’s alleged pre-marital assets with one final observation. In my view, the Husband’s choice to rely largely on his “ring-fencing” argument, and not to tender relevant evidence to substantiate his claim that his UK assets were acquired before the marriage, might have perhaps stemmed from a reluctance to disclose the full extent of his pre-marital assets. The value of all his assets (including pre-marital assets and other non-marital assets such as inheritances and gifts during the marriage) was relevant in determining the quantum of maintenance to be awarded. The reluctance to produce relevant bank statements or other documentary evidence might also have stemmed from a concern that disclosure could lead to a further train of enquiry into other undisclosed bank accounts, assets or sources of income. Nevertheless, I emphasise that in deciding this case, I had regard solely to the evidence that was before me.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What was the value of the capital, earnings and profit allocation receivable from the firm that was to be included in the matrimonial pool</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Another issue was whether the Husband’s capital, earnings and profit allocation receivable/received from the firm was part of the matrimonial pool and if so, what was the value of these assets to be included.

Should the profits be included in the asset pool, a 10% discount should be applied for the same reasons he had advanced in relation to the monies receivable from his firm’s Current Account (see above at [70]-[71]).

In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA, in delivering the judgment of the court, considered that the operative date for the division of assets would not necessarily bar the court from taking into account future employment benefits if, on the day of the ancillary matters hearing in question, it was known that a spouse would likely receive those benefits in the future due to his past services (at [21]). As the Husband had acknowledged that a profit declaration would be made in <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">September 2014</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, I found it appropriate to pro-rate and include those benefits in the pool of assets. Part of these profits due to the Husband had accrued before the date of interim judgment, and the exclusion of these pro-rated profits would effectively discount the value of the Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage, which enabled the Husband to focus on his job and career. </span>By the time of the ancillary matters hearing before me, there was also clear evidence that enabled me to ascertain with sufficient precision the pro-rated profit allocation for the period between September 2013 and March 2014. Finally, I rejected the Husband’s argument that a 10% discount should be applied to the pro-rated profits of $634,970.19

</div> In <span class="font-italic">ET v ES</span>, the husband in that case had acquired real property and shares before the marriage.

In affirming that s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter was extensive in nature and brought within the scope of matrimonial assets “any… asset of any nature acquired during the marriage”,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lee Seiu Kin J held as follows (at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These wide words are only circumscribed by the proviso which excludes “any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage”... The plain interpretation of the proviso would mean that an asset (of any nature) acquired during the marriage is a matrimonial asset unless it is a gift or inheritance that had not been substantially improved on during the marriage by either party.

</div>
</div> On this basis, the entire value of $229,138.55 should be included in the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I agreed with Lee J’s interpretation of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. The logic and reasoning for Lee J’s interpretation, which seemed to me uncontroversial, appears sufficiently from the extract cited above, and requires no repetition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 A fundamental distinction, however, had to be drawn between the issue that arose for determination in <span class="font-italic">ET v ES </span>and the issue which was before me. The case of <span class="font-italic">ET v ES </span>was concerned with the treatment of income received during the marriage from pre-marital assets under s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter; it was not concerned with the treatment of income received during the marriage from pre-marital <span class="font-italic">gifts </span>more specifically. The important difference was that, once <span class="font-italic">gifts </span>were in question, this would trigger the final portion of s 112(10) which excluded certain assets from the matrimonial pool (whether pre-marital or otherwise) by virtue of the fact that they were acquired by gift or inheritance (hereinafter referred to as “the exclusionary limb”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 As I noted above, the Husband’s position was that the shares in question were pre-marital gifts (the important point being that the shares were <span class="font-italic">gifts</span>). To determine whether the dividends received from those shares should be included in the asset pool, the real question to be answered was whether or not those dividends could properly be considered a gift as well. If so, the dividends would similarly be excluded from the matrimonial pool on the basis that they fell within the exclusionary limb.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Despite the lack of case authorities on this point, it seemed to me, as a matter of general principle, that an “asset… that has been acquired by one party… by gift or inheritance” under the exclusionary limb would be broad enough to include certain types of income received during the marriage that inexorably flowed from gifted assets. In my view, such an approach would be consistent with the rationale for excluding third-party gifts from the definition of matrimonial assets, which is to respect and recognise the donor’s intention and to prevent unmerited windfalls to the non-recipient spouse (see <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng </span>at [42]). In determining whether or not income received from gifted assets in a particular case itself qualifies as an asset acquired by gift, the test I propose is a fact-specific one, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>whether the income was so inextricably linked to the gifted asset that it might properly be said to be acquired by gift as well. This would depend on all the circumstances of the case, in particular on the nature of the gifted asset and the manner in which its income was derived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 To illustrate the application of this test, I propose to draw on two examples. The first concerns a situation where a parent institutes a trust in favour of his son which entitles the latter to receive distributions under that trust. After the son marries, he continues to receive the distributions from the trust during the marriage. In this case, it seems clear that the income would be so inextricably linked to the gifted asset, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the beneficial interest under the trust, that it must be taken to be acquired by gift as well. The second example is one by way of contrast. This concerns a situation where a third party has gifted a car to a would-be spouse. After the latter marries, he or she decides to rent out or use the car for transportation services in order to earn income. In this case, it could not be said that the income derived from the rental or from the transportation services would be so inextricably linked to the gifted asset, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the car, that it can be taken to be acquired by gift. In keeping with the fact-specific nature of the test that I have outlined, I hasten to add that these examples are meant to be general illustrations that would, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>lead to the conclusions that I have stated. The outcome reached in any particular case, as I stated earlier, would ultimately depend on the individual circumstances at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In applying the test set out above to the present facts, it was evident to me that dividends which flow from shares acquired by gift would be so inextricably linked to the shares themselves that they should be considered as having been acquired by gift. The nature of dividends is such that they flow inexorably from shares; indeed, the very value of the shares take into account the sum of dividends that may be derived from those shares. In my view, dividends from shares acquired by gift would therefore qualify as assets acquired by gift themselves. They would thus fall under the exclusionary limb of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter, and would thus not be subject to division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In the premises, I would have found for the Husband but for the fact that no objective evidence had been proffered to support his assertion that he had used the proceeds of sale of inherited property and money transfers from his father to acquire those shares in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Given that the Husband was unable to demonstrate, on the evidence, that the shares in question were acquired by gift or inheritance, the question was then whether or not dividends received during the marriage from pre-marital assets were nevertheless “matrimonial assets” under s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. In this regard, it seemed to me that, absent the qualities associated with a gift, there was no reason to treat dividend income received during the marriage any differently from any other asset acquired in the course of the marriage. As I noted above, on the plain wording of s 112(10), it would seem clear that dividend income received during the marriage would properly be considered matrimonial assets. I thus held that the amount of $229,138.55, which parties agreed represented the dividend income received from the Husband’s relevant shares during the marriage, should form part of the matrimonial pool. No deduction was thus to be made from the value of the Husband’s UK bank accounts.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the combined pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Based on my findings above, counsel submitted a joint summary of matrimonial assets on 7 September 2016 (“the Joint Summary”).

</div> Apart from the disputed assets which I considered above, the matrimonial pool included several other items that were agreed. These comprised the Husband’s deposit of $45,000 for their rented matrimonial home, his loan of $25,000 to his friend, D, certain Singapore bank accounts in the Husband’s name, and various other assets in the Wife’s name including the property in Australia. The redacted Joint Summary is annexed.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The matrimonial pool of $10,782,223 was thus a comprehensive account of each party’s respective assets based on my findings above.

By applying the “structured approach” in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>), I considered that the matrimonial assets should be divided between the Husband and the Wife in the ratio of 62.5:37.5.    Bearing in mind that the Wife was a full-time wife and mother, I had then thought it prudent to also consider the pre-<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> precedent cases to counter-check and validate my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Following my decision, the Court of Appeal issued its judgment in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”) on 3 March 2017, where it held that the “structured approach” ought not to apply to long single-income marriages. This was to ensure that a non-working spouse would not be unduly disadvantaged in the division of matrimonial assets. In any event, I was satisfied that the manner in which I applied the “structured approach” to the present facts reached an outcome which was in line with <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>.

</div> Their roles as husband and wife had always been clearly defined: the Husband was to be the family’s breadwinner and she was to care for the household and their four children so that the Husband was free to devote himself to his career unencumbered by household and child care concerns. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 She also gave evidence that, even whilst she was working full-time in the firm at the start of the marriage before the parties had children, she had taken care of the household by herself. As they did not have a domestic helper, she did all the household chores and cooked on most weekday evenings after work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 When she became pregnant with their first child, C1, in 2001, both parties agreed that she would become a full-time homemaker and the children’s main caregiver in line with their plans for a large family. According to the Husband, she was then Head of the firm’s IT department, having risen through the ranks. After the birth of C1 in 2001, the other three children followed in fairly quick succession in 2002, 2004 and then 2008. The Wife claimed that, due to the Husband’s long working hours, she was left to handle her pregnancies and care for the children on her own. Their domestic helper helped only with household chores and the Wife did not delegate her child care responsibilities. As he was very busy with his work and needed to rest when at home, the weight of child care in all respects for a growing brood of 4 young children, who were close in ages, fell on her. This included night and sick care, doctor’s visits, play, teaching of manners and discipline, supervision of their studies, planning of co-curricular activities, and ferrying them around for their programmes. She claimed that the Husband, when he was not pre-occupied with work and his social life, chose to stay out late drinking on Friday nights or go wakeboarding on the weekend instead of spending time with the family.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Apart from caring for and spending time with the Husband, she also helped organise and cook for large dinner parties at home for his colleagues.  When he asked her some years after their marriage to help with his personal administrative tasks, she essentially became his home personal assistant whom he entrusted to, for example, file his tax returns, attend to his personal letters, prepare documents and cheques for his signature,

</div> When they were babies, he would bathe them, make their milk formula and change their diapers wherever needed. Amongst other things, he would spend playtime with the children and participate in outdoor sports with them. He also helped them with their homework, in particular C1 and C2 with Mathematics. In addition, he ferried the children to a number of their extra-curricular activities, brought them out for various leisure activities, and frequently travelled overseas with them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">My decision</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 It was clear from the evidence that the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions to the welfare of the family were very substantial, in particular after she became a full-time homemaker and care-giver for the children in 2001.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 It was also clear that the Husband’s indirect financial contribution to the marriage, as sole breadwinner of the family, was very significant. Given the nature of his work and his level of responsibility (as senior partner in the firm), it must be expected that his hours would have been long with demands placed on his time and availability for work and travel. That said, I was satisfied that within the time that he had outside of his work, he was a good and engaged father.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In the circumstances, I found it fair to attribute the indirect contributions to the marriage in the proportion of 75% to the Wife and 25% to the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Step 3: Final ratio for division</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 A simple average of the two ratios above yielded an overall divisional ratio of 62.5:37.5 in favour of the Husband. In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK</span>, the Court of Appeal set out three relevant and non-exhaustive factors in determining if the relative weightage of the ratios should be adjusted: (a) the size of the matrimonial pool, (b) the duration of the marriage, and (c) the nature and extent of the parties’ indirect contributions (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I was of the view that there was no need to adjust the weightage to be attributed to each ratio. As a counter-check and to validate the overall divisional ratio, I also considered various precedents which offered helpful guidance in my assessment of a just and equitable division. The ratio of 62.5:37.5 was consistent with those precedents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I considered the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter </span>[2012] 4 SLR 785. There, the Court of Appeal observed that in long marriages, previous cases tended toward giving the non-working spouse a greater proportion of the matrimonial assets. The Court cited academic studies of decided cases which showed that the non-working spouse generally received between 35% and 50%, or even more, depending on the length of the marriage, even if that spouse did not make any direct financial contribution.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I also considered some cases with broadly similar facts. The first was <span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span>. The parties there had been married for 17 years with no children. The wife’s non-financial contributions were in taking care of the husband and her in-laws, but those were not very substantive. She did not work and there was no evidence that she had provided any financial support during the marriage. Andrew Phang J (as he then was) awarded the wife 35% of the matrimonial pool. This excluded the wife’s maintenance for which she was awarded $12,000 per month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Woon Wee Lee v Koh Ai Hua </span>[2012] SGHC 128, the marriage lasted 25 years before separation, with no children. The wife worked in various jobs as a clerk, performed some odd jobs, and taught flower arrangements and tailoring. The husband was the main breadwinner. Even though it was a childless marriage, the court found that the wife had contributed significantly to the family’s welfare, particularly in the early years of the marriage. The court awarded the wife 40% of the matrimonial pool (which did not include her lump sum maintenance). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee Soon</span> [2012] 3 SLR 402, Steven Chong J (as he then was) observed at [34] that from his review of the cases, the proportion awarded to homemaker wives who had made modest financial contributions to marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with children ranged between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets. At [35], Chong J observed that the exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife was less than 35%, typically involved cases where the total pool of matrimonial assets had been very substantial in excess of $100m. In those exceptional situations, the apportionment to the wife had nevertheless been substantial in absolute terms.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 All these cases were either affirmed by, or broadly consistent with, the latest Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK. </span>Turning to the present facts, I noted that this was a relatively long marriage of 16 years with four children. Although the Wife had not made any direct financial contributions during the marriage, a 37.5% award of the matrimonial pool to the Wife was, in the circumstances earlier outlined, a just and equitable division that was in line with the precedents and the current position at law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I thus determined that the final ratio for division of the matrimonial assets was to be 62.5:37.5 in the Husband’s favour. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Distributing the assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Implementing the division order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In distributing the assets, I ordered that each party retain their assets in their respective sole names. As the Wife’s 37.5% share of the total matrimonial assets amounted to $4,043,333 and she held $1,555,617 of the matrimonial assets in her sole name, the Husband was to pay the Wife the balance of $2,487,716.

</div> The trust fund was to be administered by an independent trustee, with the running costs to be paid from the trust fund. I was, however, not convinced that this was necessary or appropriate. The real issue in this case was not the funding of the children’s education but whether parties’ could agree on their children’s educational pathways. There were also practical issues in getting the parties to agree on the terms of the trust, the appointment of a trustee, and the costs and other details of the trust.

</div> According to her, this was justified because of her expenses, the economic prejudice she suffered from becoming a stay-at-home mother, the financial inequalities between the spouses, and the uncertainties of her income-earning capacity as a single mother to four young children. The Husband argued that no maintenance should be awarded to her as the monies due to her upon the division of matrimonial assets would be enough to even out any financial inequalities during the marriage. Alternatively, he proposed a “sliding-scale maintenance schedule”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I thus arrived at a multiplicand of $2,500 per month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In arriving at my decision on the multiplicand to be adopted, I considered it necessary to factor in housing rental for the Wife and the children.  This was because, although it may be argued that the Wife could, with her share of the matrimonial assets, buy a property for the family and save on rent, I bore in mind that the Husband, as well as the Wife and the children, had lived and continued to live in landed rental housing in good residential areas. The price of an equivalent landed property would likely be close to or exceed the value of her share of the assets. During their 16-year marriage, the parties also chose not to buy or invest in Singapore residential property, preferring to rent landed property. They did not own any joint assets. While adjustments are expected of all family members upon a divorce, the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets was her due and she should not be put in a position that was to her disadvantage relative to the Husband in deciding on how she wished to use and invest her share of the assets.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Accordingly, I adopted a multiplier of eight years, taking also into account the fact that C4, the youngest child, would be 16 years old by that time and possibly ready to go to boarding school in the UK.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Overall, this amounted to a lump sum maintenance of $240,000 for the Wife, which I found to be appropriate in all the circumstances. The Wife’s income-earning capacity was vastly different from the Husband’s. She had not worked since 2001, when their first child, C1, was born. She would have to continue to care for the younger children for the next seven to eight years during their studies in Singapore. Furthermore, C2 has some measure of autism spectrum disorder (Asperger’s Syndrome) whereas both C2 and C3 has dyslexia, which would require special attention in their care. This lump sum maintenance would supplement the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets, in order to even out any inequality arising from her having stopped work to care for the children and to enable her to reskill during the transition. Given the fundamental changes over the last 16 years since 2001 to the needs and culture of the dynamic economic landscape, it is likely that the Wife would have to upgrade her financial and other skills considerably and to re-skill to remain employable and to improve her earning capacity. There was also no issue with the Husband’s capacity to pay this amount.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the children</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In relation to the children, the parties could not agree on the maintenance quantum and the payment logistics. Here, the Wife asked for $24,690 per month for the children (comprising $5,350 for C1, $8,430 for C2, $5,530 for C3, and $5,380 for C4).

As such, my order for monthly maintenance of the children should have been for $13,200 and not $14,200.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 As it was then likely that their eldest child, C1, would go to a UK boarding school in September 2017 or in 2018, I also ordered that the Husband would pay monthly maintenance reduced by $500 a month, beginning from the month after C1 leaves for the UK. I fixed this amount for reduction after considering the likely expenses for C1 during her vacation months in Singapore. I did not deduct a proportionate amount for fixed or overhead expenses such as rental and certain household expenses. After deducting the amount of $500, the revised figure to be paid by the Husband, for the period during which C1 would be away, would be $13,700 based on my initial figure of $14,200, and $12,700 based on the revised figure of $13,200.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Educational, medical and dental expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The amount in the preceding paragraph for the children’s living expenses did not include fees for bus transport, school co-curricular activities, school outfits, school books and art supplies, piano books and piano tuning, private enrichment classes, miscellaneous school expenses, and medical and dental expenses (including orthodontic treatment for C2, and therapy and counselling for C2 for his autism spectrum disorder or Asperger’s Syndrome). Drawing on the Children’s List of Expenses, I determined the monthly expenditure for these items to be $10,000.

The Wife wanted the monies for these items to be added to the monthly maintenance amount due to be paid to her and sought power to administer the children’s maintenance. The Husband, proposed making direct payments by GIRO to certain service providers and for the remainder of the sum for the children’s educational and co-curricular expenses to be transferred to a bank account to be set up by the Wife solely for facilitating payments by him. The Wife was to provide satisfactory proof (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>receipts) of these expenses, and she would have to obtain his consent if she wished to enrol the children in any private enrichment classes and co-curricular activities in addition to those already contained in the children’s schedule as of 8 July 2016.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Husband’s submissions dated 8 July 2016 at para 12. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As the parties were unable to agree on the logistics, I directed the following payment arrangements: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In addition to the $14,200 to be paid for the children’s living expenses, the Husband was also to pay an advance of $12,000 per month for their educational, medical and dental expenses into a designated bank account set up by the Wife (“the Children’s Expenses Account”). These would cover essential variable items such as medical and dental expenses as well as educational expenses to different service providers. The total average amount to be spent per month was not to exceed $10,000. Although I had determined the children’s monthly educational, medical and dental expenses to be $10,000, I provided for an upward margin of $2,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, up to $12,000 per month) to obviate problems associated with any shortfall of funds which might occur because of different payment cycles. For example, payment for educational or CCA courses might require an advance lump sum payment thus jacking up the payments in a particular month to more than $10,000. This could be evened out in subsequent months through a reduced expenditure of less than $10,000 per month. Any shortfall was to be topped up by the Husband within a month and any excess not used would be set off to reduce the Husband’s subsequent monthly payments. Should C1 go to boarding school in the UK, the amount spent on her for these variable items would be reduced, and similarly for the other 3 children. Upon all the children reaching 21 years of age, any surplus remaining in the Children’s Expenses Account was to be paid back to the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife was to submit a 3-monthly statement for the children’s educational, medical and dental expenses, together with relevant supporting receipts or other appropriate documentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 I did not accept the Wife’s proposal on the payment logistics as it was not flexible to accommodate the children’s changing expenditure patterns. The arrangement in the preceding paragraph was geared towards addressing: (a) the concern that the Husband might, because of his busy schedule, inadvertently fail to pay; and (b) to minimise disagreement and conflict by providing for a 3-monthly expense submission by the Wife, which would save the Husband time and effort in scrutinising every expenditure before paying every month. This decision was arrived at after hearing counsel and with no apparent objection from either side. I emphasise that this was purely a logistical arrangement; the absolute amount to be paid by the Husband for the children’s variable expenses, which was not to exceed $10,000, would still be determined by the children’s actual expenses as supported by receipts and invoices, and be subject also to the qualifier that the Wife was to obtain the Husband’s consent if she wished to enrol any of the children in any private enrichment classes and co-curricular activities beyond those already in their schedule of activities as at 8 July 2016. Any concern that this could lead to unjustifiable or excessive claims would be adequately addressed by the submission of quarterly statements and supporting receipts by the Wife to the Husband. It was, for this reason, that the order also recorded that if the children’s expenses were below $36,000 for one quarter, the difference would be offset by the Husband’s $12,000 payment for the subsequent month (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that the Husband would pay less in the subsequent month). Similarly, any surplus remaining in the Children’s Expenses Account would be paid back to the Husband upon all of the children reaching 21 years of age. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 These arrangements are meant as a broad framework for the parties to co-operate in ironing out finer details. No court order can be comprehensive; this framework sets a minimum standard. Should the arrangement not work out, parties are at liberty to agree to vary or apply to amend the arrangement. It is largely for the parties to decide when one, if not both, will depart from the past as they knew it and move forward to work out some workable arrangement to collaborate and cooperate as divorced spouses with a continuing role to co-parent their children in a way that: (a) will allow the children maximum room for growth and to develop their relationship with each parent; and (b) will accord the parties, as parents, space to each find and create their own unique relationship with each child in a way that makes each important family occasion, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, graduation or a birthday party, a happy and not an uncomfortable occasion for the children when both parents attend.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Finally, I ordered that the Wife was to obtain the Husband’s consent before enrolling the children in any additional enrichment class and co-curricular activity, failing which she would be solely liable for the costs of such class or activity. Further, these activities were not to be arranged during the Husband’s access time with the children. The Husband has, in his Notice of Appeal, said that he would be submitting on appeal that this clause that I have just dealt with should further provide “that the Plaintiff [Wife] is at liberty to withdraw the children from any of the private enrichment classes and ECAs/CCAs as set out in Annex A, if the children do not want to continue to be enrolled in them.”   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I am a trifle puzzled by this point, which was not raised at the hearing. If the children do not want to continue with a class or activity, the Wife should be able to withdraw them from that class or activity without the need for an order of court so specifying. This is precisely one example of a matter that parties should try to resolve themselves without lawyers or the court. If there was a mistake in the Notice of Appeal and what was sought was for the Husband to have liberty to withdraw the children from a class or activity, my remarks are the same.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Wife’s claim of $200,000 for a new replacement car</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Last but not least, the Wife wanted the Husband to pay $200,000 for her to buy a new replacement car when the current car has to be scrapped in June 2018. She had been using a 7-seater Toyota Previa to ferry the four children to and from their various activities. A car of similar make and model would cost about $200,000 (inclusive of the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)) and the Husband had always paid for such a family car during the marriage. Alternatively, she proposed that the monthly maintenance from June 2018 be increased to provide for the instalment payments for a new car.

</div> The Husband argued that the Wife was able to buy a new car with her share of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 As the car was essentially “a family car” used for the benefit of the children, albeit also used by the Wife for her personal use and more so now since she had started working from February 2016, I directed that the parties were to share equally in the cost of a new equivalent replacement car, at a time when the current car would have to be scrapped or earlier as may be agreed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In conclusion, the orders that I made above may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties’ matrimonial assets of $10,782,223 are to be divided in the proportion of 62.5% for the Husband and 37.5% for the Wife.
