        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the first appellant, Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan
                    (“Daniel”), and the second appellant, Christopher Samson s/o
                    Anpalagan (“Christopher”), against the decision of the trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) convicting them of murder in Criminal Case
                    No 16 of 2007 (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Daniel Vijay s/o
                        Katherasan and others</em> [2008] SGHC 120 (“the
                    GD”)). The third appellant, Nakamuthu Balakrishnan (alias Bala)
                    (“Bala”), originally appealed as well against his conviction for
                    murder, but subsequently decided not to proceed with his appeal (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> below). For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to the
                    three appellants collectively as “the Appellants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This appeal requires us to consider the scope of s 34 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Penal Code”).
                    Section 34 of the 1985 Penal Code has its roots in s 34 of the Penal
                    Code (Ordinance 4 of 1871) (“the 1871 Penal Code”), which was
                    enacted in 1872 when Singapore was part of the Straits Settlements. Since 1872,
                    s 34 of the 1871 Penal Code has remained unchanged in all the subsequent
                    editions of the Penal Code up to the current edition (<em>ie</em>, the 2008 revised edition). For convenience, the generic term
                    “the Penal Code” will hereafter be used to denote the particular
                    version of the Penal Code that is relevant to the case or legal point being
                    discussed, regardless of whether that version is the 1985 revised edition or
                    some other edition, and s 34 of the Penal Code (<em>ie</em>, “the Penal Code” as just defined) will be
                    denoted by the generic term “s 34”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It might be thought that since s 34 was enacted some 138 years ago, its
                    meaning would already have been settled through judicial interpretation. But,
                    this does not appear to be the case. In 1999, this court (which will also be
                    referred to interchangeably as “the CA”) said in <em>Shaiful Edham bin Adam and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1999] 1 SLR(R) 442 (“<em>Shaiful
                        Edham</em>”) at [52] that there were “two divergent
                    lines of authority” on the scope of s 34, one of which was wrong.
                    However, this statement did not have the effect of settling the law on s 34
                    as, in <em>Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 447 (“<em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em>”), this court restricted the operation of
                    the legal principle encapsulated in the accepted line of authority (see
                        <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Despite the decision in <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>,
                    s 34 remains a troubling provision. In the present case, for instance, the
                    Judge applied s 34 to convict Daniel and Christopher on a joint charge of
                    murder arising from Bala’s criminal act of assaulting the deceased victim,
                    Wan Cheon Kem (“Wan”), even though:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Appellants had not planned (<em>ie</em>, they had
                        no common intention) to kill Wan or cause his death, but had only the common
                        intention to rob him of the cargo of mobile phones which he was transporting
                        (“the Cargo”) (see the GD at [40] and [51]–[52]);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was Bala alone who caused the death of Wan by intentionally inflicting
                        a series of blows on the latter’s head with a baseball bat
                        (“the baseball bat”), resulting in Wan sustaining injuries
                        which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and
                        which did indeed cause his death a few days after the assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the light of these findings, the Judge held that he was compelled by law to
                    convict both Daniel and Christopher of murder as secondary offenders pursuant to
                    s 34 for the offence of murder arising from the criminal act committed by
                    Bala, the actual doer of that criminal act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Judge’s decision highlights the apparent harsh effect of the
                    application of s 34 in these circumstances. The outcome is particularly
                    unjust when the offence charged is that of murder. This expansive interpretation
                    of s 34 stems from certain statements on the scope of s 34 made by Wee
                    Chong Jin CJ in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (“the
                    CCA”) in <em>Wong Mimi and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1971–1973] SLR(R) 412
                        (“<em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>”). It has
                    led to uncertainty in the way our courts have been applying s 34 in cases
                    where the offenders (<em>ie</em>, the actual doer and the
                    secondary offender(s)) have a common intention to commit a particular offence
                    (or a criminal act resulting in a particular offence) and, in the course of
                    committing that offence or that criminal act, another (more serious) offence (or
                    another criminal act resulting in a more serious offence) is committed (such
                    cases are commonly referred to as “twin crime” cases (see further
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below)). In the circumstances, we
                    find it necessary to revisit <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    and the relevant case law on s 34 in order to clarify this difficult area
                    of the law. We shall do this after we have considered the factual and legal
                    issues raised in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Participants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Daniel was, at the material time, a male aged 23 who was a full-time national
                    serviceman (“NSF”) with the Singapore Armed Forces (“the
                    SAF”). He was, at the material time, absent without official leave
                    (“AWOL”) from the SAF, and had been detained in the SAF Detention
                    Barracks for being AWOL on four previous occasions. He had also been a secret
                    society member in the past.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Christopher was, at the material time, a male aged 23 who was also a
                    NSF with the SAF. He too was AWOL at the time of the offence. Previously, he had
                    been detained in the SAF Detention Barracks for being AWOL on three occasions.
                    Bala was, at the material time, a male aged 48 who had previously worked as an
                    odd-job labourer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He had spent time in prison for being AWOL from the SAF and for
                    various drug offences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Bala played a key role in the execution and planning of the robbery.
                    There was some evidence that Bala had a dominant influence over Daniel and
                    Christopher, and was a father figure to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> (This relationship could explain why Daniel and Christopher
                    initially attempted to shield Bala from prosecution (after the Appellants were
                    arrested) by falsely claiming that Daniel had beaten up Wan during the robbery
                    and that Bala had not had anything to do with the assault (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> below).)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Apart from the Appellants, there were two other persons who were involved in
                    the initial planning of the robbery, <em>viz</em>, one Ragu
                    a/l Ramajayam (“Ragu”) and one Arsan s/o Krishnasamy Govindarajoo
                    (alias Babu) (“Babu”). Babu, in fact, played a major role in the
                    planning of the robbery. Ragu was a driver employed by Sterling Agencies Pte Ltd
                    (“Sterling”), a freight-forwarding company. His role was to
                    provide information to Babu on when Sterling would be transporting expensive
                    cargo from Changi Airfreight Centre (“CAC”) to consignees. Babu
                    was a second-hand goods dealer. He was introduced to Ragu by one Shanker, a
                    mutual acquaintance who was not involved in the robbery. Wan, the deceased
                    victim, was, at the material time, working as a driver for Sterling and was a
                    colleague of Ragu. Babu admitted that he was the originator of the idea that
                    during the robbery, the driver of the targeted lorry should be beaten up until
                    he became unconscious so that he would not know what was happening and would not
                    be able to recognise the perpetrators (see sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> below). Both Ragu and Babu were, however,
                    charged with lesser offences (see, respectively, <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> and <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Undisputed facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in May 2006, Ragu and Babu hatched a plan to carry out a robbery of
                    expensive cargo to be transported by Sterling from CAC for delivery to
                    consignees. Babu recruited Bala to carry out the robbery. Bala then recruited
                    Daniel and Christopher to assist him in carrying out the robbery. Sometime
                    before the day of the robbery, Daniel took the baseball bat from a workshop at
                    Changi where he had his car serviced. Several days before the robbery, Babu and
                    Bala went to survey CAC. They were driven there by Christopher. On the evening
                    of 29 May 2006, Babu and the Appellants met at a coffee shop at
                    Block 125 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh to have some drinks. In the course of the
                    evening, the robbery plan was discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 30 May 2006, at about 5.30am, Ragu contacted Babu and informed him
                    that Sterling would be delivering the Cargo, which consisted of ten pallets of
                    mobile phones (later found to contain 2,700 Sony Ericsson W700i mobile phones
                    valued at about US$823,500), that morning from CAC to a consignee by lorry. Babu
                    relayed the information to Bala, who was with Daniel and Christopher at that
                    time. The Appellants then proceeded to the vicinity of CAC in a rented ten-foot
                    lorry bearing the registration number GM9520E (“Lorry 9520”),
                    taking with them the baseball bat. They subsequently met up with Babu, who told
                    them that the lorry carrying the Cargo bore the registration number YM815B
                    (“Lorry 815”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At about 7.00am, the Appellants saw Lorry 815 being driven out of CAC (by
                    Wan). Bala directed Daniel to follow Lorry 815 in Lorry 9520, while
                    Babu, who was also at the scene, drove off separately in another lorry.
                    Somewhere along Changi Coast Road, Daniel drove in front of Lorry 815,
                    causing Wan to stop it by the side of the road. After Wan alighted from
                    Lorry 815, he was assaulted by Bala repeatedly on the head and other parts
                    of the body with the baseball bat, although he was not rendered unconscious. He
                    was then carried into the cabin of Lorry 815 and put on the floorboard in
                    front of the passenger seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Daniel, together with Christopher, then drove Lorry 815 to Pasir Ris Car
                    Park A at Jalan Loyang Besar in the vicinity of Costa Sands Resort
                    (“Car Park A”). Bala followed in Lorry 9520. After
                    arriving at Car Park A, Daniel and Bala transferred two pallets of the
                    Cargo (comprising 540 mobile phones) from Lorry 815 to Lorry 9520.
                    Bala then instructed Christopher to drive Lorry 9520 with the two pallets
                    on board to Daniel’s rented apartment in Ang Mo Kio (“the Ang Mo
                    Kio Apartment”). Shortly after, Babu arrived at Car Park A to join
                    Daniel and Bala, who transferred the remaining eight pallets of the Cargo
                    (comprising 2,160 mobile phones) from Lorry 815 to Babu’s lorry. Babu
                    then left Car Park A with Daniel and Bala, while Lorry 815 (with Wan
                    in it) was left at the car park. Later, Daniel and Bala met up with Christopher,
                    and they transferred the two pallets of the Cargo from Lorry 9520 to the
                    Ang Mo Kio Apartment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At about 8.52am that same day, a member of the public reported to Pasir Ris
                    Neighbourhood Police Centre that he had found a man covered in blood in a lorry.
                    The police went to investigate and found Wan sitting in the front passenger seat
                    of Lorry 815. Wan managed to alight from the lorry on his own when the
                    police opened the door of the passenger compartment. He was sent to Changi
                    General Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery on his head. He died
                    without regaining consciousness on 5 June 2006, about five days after the
                    robbery. The autopsy performed by Dr Teo Eng Swee
                    (“Dr Teo”), a consultant forensic pathologist with the Centre
                    for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, disclosed that at least 15
                    blows had been inflicted on Wan on the head and other parts of his body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Police investigations subsequently led to the arrest of Bala at about 6.50pm
                    on 31 May 2006. Ragu and Babu were arrested separately on 1 June 2006.
                    Daniel and Christopher surrendered themselves to the police separately on the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution of Ragu</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 24 April 2007, Ragu was charged with one count of abetment (by

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the proceedings against Babu, the Prosecution tendered a consolidated

                    respective roles of each of the Appellants in the robbery and the killing of
                    Wan. Amongst other things, the CSOF stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     “[Babu’s] role was to execute the
                            robbery”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Babu subsequently recruited Bala to commit the robbery, and Bala
                        in turn recruited Daniel and Christopher to assist him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellants “procured a baseball bat [<em>ie</em>, the baseball bat as defined at sub-para (b) of
                            <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above] from a car workshop at
                        Changi Road, where [Daniel] had sent his motor car for repairs, for use
                        during the robbery”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Babu told the Appellants that “during the robbery, they should beat
                        up [Wan] until he became unconscious”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This would ensure that Wan “[would] not know what was
                        happening and … would be unable to identify any of them
                            subsequently”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The admissions by Babu in the CSOF incriminated Daniel and Christopher as to
                    their knowledge that in the course of the robbery, Wan would be beaten up until
                    he became unconscious. Babu, who was called as a prosecution witness, refuted
                    the truth of the CSOF when cross-examined and claimed that he had admitted to
                    the CSOF in order to escape the gallows.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (Babu was not questioned by the Prosecution during re-examination on
                    his claim that he had admitted to false facts in the CSOF.) In the GD, the Judge
                    ruled that little or no weight should be given to the CSOF against the
                    Appellants (see the GD at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellants’ statements to the police</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Each of the Appellants gave a number of statements to the police. In his
                    statements, Bala tried to exculpate himself from the killing of Wan and to pin
                    the blame on Daniel and Christopher instead, alleging that they had beaten Wan
                    up with the baseball bat. In this regard, Daniel and Christopher had, in their
                    first statements to the police, stated that Daniel had beaten Wan up and that
                    Bala had played no part in the assault. In subsequent statements that were
                    recorded after they had been charged with the murder of Wan, and likewise at the
                    trial, both Daniel and Christopher repudiated what they had said in their first
                    statements. In one of his subsequent statements, Daniel explained that he
                    initially thought that he would face a charge of robbery and was thus willing to
                    make his initial admissions in order to shield Bala, who was more than 20 years
                    his senior, so that Bala would not be sent to prison.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, when informed that he faced a charge for the offence of
                    murder, Daniel changed his story and decided to disclose his actual limited role
                    in the robbery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It was clear, on the evidence, that both Daniel and Christopher were
                    initially not aware that they could have committed the offence of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At the trial, the Prosecution sought to adduce all of the Appellants’
                    statements. The Appellants challenged the admissibility of some of the
                    statements on the ground that they were involuntary statements. The Judge held,
                    after a trial-within-a-trial, that all the statements had been voluntarily made
                    and admitted them in evidence. Subsequently, after entering their respective
                    defences, each of the Appellants retracted the incriminating portions of his
                    respective statements.</p>

<b><u>Contemporaneous Statement – 6 June
                                2006</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">About one week before the robbery, I came home [at] about
                            5 – 6 am after clubbing. At home, I saw Bala and
                            Christopher watching TV in the hall. I asked them why they were not
                            sleeping. Bala told me he was waiting for Babu to call. Bala also told
                            me that Babu gave a “lobang” to take the truck from Cargo
                            Complex [<em>ie</em>, CAC]. The truck got
                            handphones. Bala asked me to drive the 24 footer containing the
                            handphones and I agreed. I then lie down on the sofa waiting for
                            Babu’s call. At about 6am plus, Babu called the house. Bala
                            answered the phone and Babu said the truck carried laptop so we
                            ‘don’t do that day’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">After that, we have all been awake around the same timing, waiting at
                            home for Babu’s call.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">About 2 days after I get to know about the ‘lobang’, on
                            one afternoon, Bala, Christopher and I were at a workshop in Changi to
                            repair a rented lorry from my uncle Chinnasamy Raman [<em>ie</em>, Lorry 9520]. At the workshop, Bala took a
                            wooden stick [<em>ie</em>, the baseball bat] and
                            passed it to me. The wooden stick was about the length of my leg. Bala
                            told me to keep the stick in the lorry. I then put the stick under the
                            floor mat of the [p]assenger seat. After the lorry was being repaired,
                            the 3 of us went back home. On the way back to Toa Payoh from the
                            workshop, I asked Bala what the wooden stick was for, Bala said it can
                            be used for the ‘lobang’. I understood that the wooden stick
                            will be use to hit the driver of the 24 footer truck.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When I first knew about the ‘lobang’, I already knew we
                            were going to hit the driver of the 24 footer truck. Bala was the
                            one telling me and Christopher about the plan. This was on the same day
                            I saw them in the living room after I came back from clubbing.</p>

<b><u>Investigation Statement – 9 June

</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">8    On 30 May 2006 at about 5.00am to 5.30am, I came back home. I
                                knocked on the door and Bala opened the door. When I entered the
                                flat, Christopher was sleeping in the hall. I sat down in the hall
                                and Bala told me to get ready to leave. Bala woke Christopher up and
                                told him to get ready. On that day, I was wearing a pair of jeans. I
                                just change my shirt. At about 5.45am, we left the flat and got into
                                the same lorry that we used to go to the workshop. Bala and I sat
                                behind the lorry. Christopher drove the lorry. Before we moved off,
                                Bala told Christopher to proceed to Cargo Complex. When we were
                                along the PIE near to Upper Serangoon Exit, I felt like vomiting
                                because I was drinking too much earlier. I slapped the driver side
                                door several times and told Christopher to stop the lorry.
                                Christopher stopped the lorry at the side of the PIE. I got down and
                                sat in the front passenger seat with him. Bala sat behind.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">9    We arrived at Cargo Complex at about 6.15am to 6.20am. Bala from
                                behind told Christopher to park the lorry at the parking lot near to
                                the place where the people change their pass to go into Cargo
                                Complex. I think there were no cars in the parking lots. I saw lorry
                                drivers coming out from Cargo Complex, the drivers would stop near
                                to the pass office to change their passes before leaving the
                                complex.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10    After we parked the lorry, I got down from the lorry and walked
                                over to the driver side. I told Christopher that I will drive and
                                told him to move over. He move over to the passenger seat. I got
                                into the driver seat. Shortly after that, Bala came down from the
                                lorry and sat at the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">11    About 10 minutes later at about 6.30am, Babu came in his lorry. I
                                do not know the number. It was a grey colour aluminium cover behind
                                lorry and the front was white colour. He parked his lorry beside
                                near to the passenger side. He wind down the window and told us that
                                the truck number is “815” and said that the company
                                name was “Sterling”. At this point, a lorry passed by
                                and the driver pressed the horn and waved at Babu. Babu also waved
                                his hand at the driver. Babu told us that the truck will be like
                                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">13    A few minutes later, the truck he mentioned came out of cargo
                                complex. Babu said “this is the truck”. I saw the
                                company name “Sterling” on the front of the lorry. The
                                lorry number was 815. I cannot remember the letters on the licence
                                plate. The lorry 815 came out and stopped at the traffic light.
                                Immediately, I drove the lorry following the lorry 815. I saw
                                the lorry turn right into the main road outside Cargo Complex
                                travelling [in] the opposite direction of Changi Village. I do not
                                know where the road will lead to. I just followed the lorry. I
                                remembered along the way, Bala was talking to someone over the
                                handphone. I think he was talking to Babu. I heard Bala said we all
                                were following the lorry already.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">15    The lorry driver was travelling slowly [at] about 50 to 60km per
                                hour. I followed him very closely, about one lorry length behind the
                                said lorry 815. We followed for quite a distance from Cargo
                                Complex. We followed the lorry for about 5 to 10 minutes when Bala
                                told me to overtake the lorry and parked infront [<em>sic</em>] of him. Immediately I swerve the lorry to the
                                right and overtake the lorry. After I passed the lorry, I cut into
                                his path and stepped on the brakes. The lorry I drove stopped. The
                                other lorry 815 also stopped. We stopped at the left side of
                                the road. There were two lanes on the said road.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">16    Bala immediately opened the passenger door and got down from the
                                lorry. Bala stood on the grass verge near to the road kerb.
                                Christopher also got down and went around the front of our lorry and
                                stood behind near to the rear right side of the lorry. I still sat
                                in the driver seat looking at the side view mirror to see whether
                                there were any vehicles coming our way. From the right side mirror,
                                I could see the driver of lorry 815 came down and walked
                                towards Christopher. The driver was Chinese. I saw Christopher was
                                pretending to check our vehicle and the lorry for damages. I saw the
                                driver bending down and Christopher was also bending down. They were
                                saying something which I do not know and pointing at certain part of
                                the vehicles. I then heard Bala calling the driver to come over to
                                him to change particulars. I think at this point, by looking at the
                                left mirror, I saw Bala standing on the left side of our lorry
                                somewhere in the middle. I saw him holding the same wooden stick
                                which we got from the workshop in his left hand. He was trying to
                                hide the wooden stick behind his left leg.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">17    Through the mirror, I saw that when the driver walked to Bala,
                                Bala suddenly pulled the front part of the driver’s shirt and
                                pulled him. When Bala did this, the driver fell to the ground on the
                                grass verge. I saw that when the driver fell, he was facing the
                                ground and used his hand to stop the fall. The driver then turned
                                around to get up. While he was sitting on the ground about to get
                                up, I saw Bala swing the wooden stick towards the driver. I could
                                not remember whether Bala swing the wooden stick from the left or
                                right side but he was holding the wooden stick with both his hands
                                when he swing it at the driver. The wooden stick hit the driver on
                                the face. I do not know how many times Bala hit the driver as I
                                concentrated myself to look around to see whether any car are
                                passing by[.] About one or two minutes later, Bala shouted at me to
                                come down from the lorry. I came out of the lorry and walked over to
                                where Bala was with the driver. I saw that the driver was lying down
                                on the ground facing the sky. His legs were nearer to his lorry. I
                                saw a lot of blood on his face. The driver was mumbling something
                                and moving his body from slightly side to side. Bala told me and
                                Christopher to carry the driver and put him inside the cabin of the
                                24 footer. I carried his left leg using my left hand because my
                                right hand was injured. I cannot remember clearly but Bala and
                                Christopher were on either side of the driver. One of them was
                                carrying the driver by his hand and right leg while the other was
                                carrying him up by holding the driver’s left hand and back. We
                                carried him up and put him on the floor of the passenger seat of the
                                24 footer. I do not remember who had opened the door first
                                before we carried the driver. We then pushed him onto the floor of
                                the passenger seat head first and his knees were bent. I do not
                                remember who closed the passenger door. Christopher and I then went
                                around to the driver seat of the 24 footer. Christopher entered
                                the lorry first and sat on the centre part of the front cabin. I
                                also got into the lorry and sat on the driver seat. As I wanted to
                                drive the lorry, I saw that the same wooden stick was on the floor
                                of the 24 footer near to my leg. I drove off the lorry. Before
                                I drove off, I saw Bala got into the driver side of our lorry. I had
                                to put the right signal and overtake the white lorry on the right
                                and moved off. As I was driving, the wooden stick was rolling on the
                                floor[.] I picked it up and put it standing beside me on my left. As
                                I was driving, the driver wanted to get up. I hit him lightly with
                                my left hand on the head about 4 to 5 times, on and off as he wanted
                                to get up. After I hit him the last time[,] [h]e did not try to get
                                up anymore but he was moaning all the way. I drove the
                                24 footer to Pasir Ris Park near to Costa Sands. I went there
                                because I knew about this place as I had been there several times
                                before at the Chalet nearby.</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">18    I wish to say now that in the past Bala and I had asked
                                “Babu” for financial help. We were short of cash and
                                needed money urgently. When we spoke to him, he also told us that he
                                was in a very bad position and needed money. “Babu”
                                then told us that he would try to find something for us to do so
                                that all of us can settle our money problem. I wish to clarify that
                                I usually asked Bala to lend me money whenever I had money problems.
                                Bala would then call Babu for help and this was usually the reply we
                                get from Babu. I had also received some money from Bala.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">19    About one to two weeks before 23<sup>rd</sup> or
                                    24<sup>th</sup> May 2006, Bala told me
                                about this “lobang”. Bala told me that we can beat up
                                the driver of the lorry carrying handphones from Cargo Complex and
                                then robbed the goods. We did not talk about this anymore.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">20    A few days after 23<sup>rd</sup> or
                                    24<sup>th</sup> May 2006, at about 9.00pm,
                                Bala, Christopher and I went to the coffeeshop at Blk 125
                                Lorong 1 Toa Payoh to have some drinks. My friend Povaneswaran
                                was also sitting with us. While we were there, Bala called Babu and
                                asked him to come and meet us at Blk 125 Toa Payoh Coffeeshop
                                to talk about what we are going to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">21    About 30 minutes later, Babu came to the same coffeeshop and sat
                                with us. We continued drinking beers at the coffeeshop. Shortly
                                after that, Povaneswaran left.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22    Babu then told us how we would carry out the robbery. He told us
                                that we will have to follow the truck from Cargo Complex and stop
                                the driver in between somewhere. We must beat up the driver until he
                                cannot wake [u]p and do not know what is happening. After that we
                                will take his truck. He wanted to know from us, who among us can
                                drive and who were going to do what in the picture. After that Babu
                                said that he will leave it to us on what we need to do in the
                                robbery. Bala replied to Babu to leave it to him on what to do. Bala
                                said that he will tell me and Christopher what to do. Babu told us
                                that the truck is a 24 footer canopy truck carrying handphones.
                                He said that the truck will carry full truckload of handphones and
                                we can sell them for a lot of money. He did not say the amount. Bala
                                then pointed his finger [at] me and told Babu that I will be the one
                                driving the 24 footer lorry. Bala said that he will be the one
                                to whack the driver.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">23    Later, Bala said that after the driver cannot wake up, all of us
                                will carry the driver into the 24 footer lorry. Bala said that
                                he wants me to drive the 24 footer lorry and will get
                                Christopher to assist me in the 24 footer in case the driver
                                woke up. Babu then suggested a place to drive the 24 footer to.
                                It was somewhere in Changi. Bala then tried to explain the location
                                to me. I told them that I do not know the place they were talking
                                about. I said I will think about a place to drive the 24 footer
                                to and will tell them later.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">24    After that, we continued drinking.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">25    At about 11.00pm plus, Christopher and I left the coffeeshop
                                leaving Bala and Babu to continue drinking. Christopher dropped me
                                off at my flat at Blk 179 Toa Payoh and left. I think he went
                                back to join Bala and Babu. I got changed and went to Boat

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">71    With regards to paragraph 19, I wish to clarify that this was
                                the first time that I got to know from Bala about the
                                “lobang” or plan to rob the lorry drivers carrying
                                handphones. In the beginning, Bala told me about a plan to just
                                steal the truck carrying handphones when the driver stopped their
                                truck and alight from his lorry to walk to the Pass office to change
                                his pass before going out of Cargo complex. However, this plan was
                                changed just before the incident when Bala, Babu, Christopher and I
                                met at the coffeeshop at Blk 125 Toa Payoh. It was during this
                                meeting that Babu changed the plan and wanted us to beat up the
                                driver of the lorry until he cannot wake up and do not know what was
                                happening. He said that he wanted us to do this because he does not
                                want the driver to recognize us.</p>

                                us. At that time he told us that on Tuesday morning, there is a
                                lorry from Cargo Complex bringing handphones. Bala asked Babu for
                                the exact timing. Babu told us to meet at 6.30am and he would tell
                                us the vehicle number. Daniel asked Babu what should we do. He told

                                mother’s house at Blk 179 Toa Payoh Central. Daniel and
                                Bala were there. At about 8.00pm, Bala suggested that we go to the
                                coffeeshop at Blk 125 Toa Payoh to have some drinks. We drove
                                to the said coffeeshop. Along the way, Bala told me and Daniel that
                                Babu is coming to the same coffeeshop to meet us. We arrived there

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">5    Sometime around 9.00pm to 10.00pm, Babu came. While we were having
                                drinks, Babu told Bala that handphones are being taken out from
                                Cargo Complex. Bala then asked Babu how Babu wanted it to be done.
                                At this point I do not understand what they were talking about. I
                                think they must have discussed this earlier. Babu instructed Bala
                                saying “<em>Tomorrow morning, handphones is
                                    being delivered from the lorry from Cargo Complex. We should
                                    somehow take the phones. If we take it, there is good
                                    money</em>”. Bala replied “<em>how is it to be done</em>”. Babu replied
                                    “<em>Come at 6.30 in the morning at Cargo

                                    the lorry leaves the place, tail him from behind, see a good
                                    spot and to knock his lorry on the side. He will then stop the
                                    lorry. He will then alight from the lorry and inspect the
                                    damage. When he is inspecting the damage, beat him up until he
                                    becomes unconscious</em>”. Bala then asked Babu,
                                    “<em>Why the driver has to be beaten up
                                    until he was unconscious. Why can’t we just blindfold,
                                    gagged and tie him up</em>”. Babu replied
                                    “<em>This is risky. He should not know
                                    what is happening to him. There will be a lot of vehicles
                                    passing by. Once he becomes unconscious, put him back into the
                                    lorry and drive him to the spot where I will mention in the
                                    morning</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">6    Bala then asked Babu that if we were to carry out what he said how
                                much money we are going to get. Babu replied that he does not know
                                what kind of handphones is being delivered. He said that if Bala
                                were to take the handphones and passed them to Babu, Babu would give
                                him a certain amount of money the following day. Babu said that at
                                the spot which he will mention later, the pallets have to be
                                transferred into his (Babu’s) lorry and after that, we can
                                leave. After that, all of us continued drinking. We were at the
                                coffeeshop until about 1.00am. Before we left the place, Bala told
                                Babu to meet at Cargo Complex at 6.30am that same morning. Daniel,
                                Bala and I then went back to Blk 179 Toa Payoh and slept there
                                for the night. Babu went home.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7    While we were in the flat, I told Bala that I was not comfortable
                                about joining them to commit the robbery. Bala told me that I do not
                                have to do anything. He told me that I would just have to drive the
                                rented lorry from Changi to Blk 645 Ang Mo Kio and wait for him
                                there. He did not tell me anything more. After that, Bala told
                                Daniel saying “<em>What you are going to do
                                    is, you will drive the lorry from Cargo Complex and tail the
                                    lorry. I will tell you at a certain spot to knock the lorry. You
                                    will then knock the lorry. When he (the driver) is inspecting
                                    the damage, I will hit him. He (the driver) will fall down
                                    immediately, carry the driver and put him in the lorry. After
                                    that, you drive the lorry carrying the phones and drive the
                                    lorry to the spot where Babu mentions</em>.[”] Bala
                                then told me “<em>You then drive the rented
                                    lorry from the spot mentioned by Babu and drive it to Ang Mo
                                    Kio</em>.” I agreed to follow them since my role is
                                only to drive the rented lorry as directed by Bala.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">8    At about 6.00am, Daniel woke me up from sleep. He told me that it
                                was 6.00am. I washed my face and after that, together with Bala and
                                Daniel, we went downstairs to the lorry that was parked at the side
                                main road. I went to the driver seat and at this point, I noticed a
                                baseball bat [<em>ie</em>, the baseball bat]
                                tucked behind the passenger seat. It looks like dark brown or black
                                in colour. This is the first time that I notice the baseball bat in
                                the lorry. I drove the lorry. Daniel and Bala sat behind the
                                lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">9    While I was driving along the PIE just after the Kallang Way Exit,
                                Daniel used his can of beer and knocked on the side of the lorry. He
                                told me to stop the lorry. I parked the lorry at the side of the
                                PIE. He came down from the lorry and sat at the passenger seat.
                                After that, I continued driving. I then asked Daniel
                                    “<em>what is this</em>” and
                                pointing to the baseball bat. He pulled up the baseball bat and just
                                replied “<em>Baseball bat</em>”.
                                I asked him “<em>Why, to beat up the man or
                                    what</em>?” and he replied “<em>Yes</em>”. I asked him where he took the
                                baseball bat from. Daniel told me that he got the baseball bat from
                                the workshop at Upper Changi Road. Bala had taken it and put it
                                inside the lorry. The baseball bat was about 1 meter in length
                                (about the height of this table). One end of the bat was slim and
                                about half the length of a computer diskette in diameter. The
                                diameter for the other end was bigger, slightly more than the length
                                of a computer diskette.</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">53    I only knew that we are going to commit robbery. My family is

                                I needed money. I did not beat up the Chinese man. What I told the
                                man was just go and speak to my “uncle”, Bala. I did
                                not know that he would be beaten up to this extent.</p>

<b><u>Investigation Statement – 12 June

</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10    A week after this session, in May 2006, Babu asked me to meet him
                                at the coffeeshop at Blk 73 Toa Payoh Lorong 4. I then
                                brought along Daniel with me. I had told Daniel that Babu would be
                                giving me the full details and how much each of us would get from
                                the loots. I had already informed Daniel as to what items we were
                                going to steal. We met Babu around 4.00 pm at the coffeeshop
                                and we have ‘Guinness’ stout drinks. During the drinks,
                                Babu told us that it was a very good ‘lobang’ and each
                                of us could make about S$50,000/=. He also told us that when the
                                driver was changing his pass, we should drive away his lorry and
                                unload the cargo onto Babu’s lorry at a deserted place. Daniel
                                then told Babu to give all the details to me and left the place. He
                                said he would find out all the details from me. After Daniel left,
                                Babu told me that both he and I would go to Changi cargo complex
                                    [<em>ie</em>, CAC] to view and survey the
                                place regarding the movements of the vehicles. Before we left the
                                coffeeshop, Babu had also told me that during the theft should the
                                driver try to stop our driver, then we should push the driver away
                                or punch him. Around 7.00 pm, Babu and I left the coffeeshop.
                                The following morning Babu picked me up in his lorry bearing
                                registration number something like GM 3452 or GM 3542 from
                                the carpark at Blk 73 Toa Payoh. As I was leaving the house,
                                Daniel’s friend Christopher asked me as to where I was going.
                                The previous night, he came to stay at Blk 179 Toa Payoh after
                                the church session along with Daniel. I told Christopher that I was
                                going towards Changi and he came along. I did not mention anything
                                to Daniel since he was sleeping after some drinks the previous
                                day.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">11    When I met Babu at 5.30 am, I introduced Christopher to him
                                as Daniel’s friend. Babu did not mention anything. Whilst
                                travelling to Changi midway, I told Christopher that we were going
                                to Changi cargo complex to survey the place. When Christopher asked
                                me as to why we were going there to survey, I told him we were going
                                there to do the surveying as we were planning to commit theft later
                                from the lorry. I told him because I trusted him that he would not
                                tell anyone. At that time, Babu and I did not have the intention to
                                include Christopher in our group to commit the theft. We reached the
                                cargo complex at about 6.00 am and Babu had parked his lorry at
                                the parking bay about 40-feet from the pass office. Babu showed me
                                the three yellow coloured lorries with the logo of
                                ‘Sterling’ company leaving the cargo complex at
                                intervals of about 20 minutes. He then pointed to the first
                                lorry and told me that I cannot do anything to that lorry with an
                                attendant. The driver of the first lorry was a male Indian and his
                                lorry attendant was a male Chinese. They changed their passes at the
                                checkpoint and left. When the second lorry arrived to change the
                                pass, I noticed the driver was a male Chinese and there was no
                                attendant to this lorry. Babu then told me that perhaps the second
                                lorry may carry goods and one of us could drive the lorry from the
                                pass-office and go away with the goods. When the third lorry came, I
                                noticed the driver was a male Indian and there was no attendant also
                                in that lorry. Babu said that perhaps this lorry may also carry
                                goods and one of us could drive the lorry from the pass-office and
                                go away with the goods. I did not notice the registration number for
                                all the three lorries. Babu had told me only out of these three
                                lorries, that either the second or third would be our target and
                                that we would have to look for. He did not mention about any other
                                lorries. All these while, Christopher was beside us watching as to
                                what we were doing. He did not mention anything. Babu and I did the
                                survey until 7.00 am. Babu then drove us back to Blk 73
                                Toa Payoh coffeeshop. Babu said he would contact me later and let me
                                know when to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">12    Christopher did not utter anything until at night when we were
                                having a drinking session with Daniel at home. Daniel asked me as to
                                what happened about the survey and I told him everything was
                                ‘ok’. Christopher then told Daniel that everything so
                                simple and that he wished to participate. I then told Christopher
                                that only Daniel and I were sharing at $50,000/= each. I also told
                                Christopher that I would first find out from Babu as to how much the
                                entire loot would work out to before we could include Christopher in
                                the matter. Christopher then told me to find out and let him know
                                later. The same night at about 11.00 pm, I called Babu from
                                Christopher’s handphone to find out whether we could really
                                make money out of the loot, or otherwise I did not want to get
                                involved. Babu then replied saying that the minimum sum all three of
                                us, meaning Daniel, Christopher and myself could make would be a
                                minimum sum of S$150,000/=, if not more. Babu was not bothered as to
                                how many of us were involved in doing it and that he would pay a
                                minimum of S$150,000/=. He also said that he would pay more if he
                                could get more. I did not mention to Babu that I was going to
                                involve Christopher in the matter. At about midnight, we never
                                talked about the matter again since Daniel’s mother Rachael
                                came home.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">15    After we had done this survey at the Changi cargo complex, Daniel
                                sent his car to Changi Road. We followed him in our lorry
                                GM 9520 [<em>ie</em>, Lorry 9520] and
                                Christopher was driving the lorry. After giving the car for
                                servicing, Daniel picked up a discarded pole [<em>ie</em>, the baseball bat], in the size of a cricket bat,
                                from the workshop and brought [it] to the lorry. He placed the pole
                                underneath the passenger’s seat, beside the driver.
                                Christopher and I saw this. I asked him why he needed that and he
                                said it could be of use one day. Christopher then drove us back
                                home.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">16    On 29 May 2006 at about 9.30 pm, Christopher called me
                                at home and told me that Babu wanted to meet all of us at the
                                coffeeshop at Blk 125 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 [at] around
                                10.00 pm. Christopher also said that Daniel, his friend Shanker
                                and Christopher were already there and asked me to join them. When I
                                arrived at the coffeeshop, Babu had not come yet. Daniel’s
                                friend Shanker who was at the coffeeshop earlier left the coffeeshop
                                when his mother passed by. This was before Babu arrived at the
                                coffeeshop. At the coffeeshop, we had ‘Guinness’ stout
                                and ‘Heineken’ beer. Babu gave me S$300/= from which I
                                paid for the drinks. During our drinking session, Babu told us that
                                we can do the loot on the following morning at 5.30. Babu said he
                                would call us again the following morning to confirm and asked us to
                                be ready. Babu said he already knew one of the yellow coloured
                                lorries was carrying either handphones or laptops. He further said
                                he wanted to confirm which lorry was carrying these items before he
                                could confirm with us. He also further told us that we could go with
                                it if the lorry was either carrying handphones or laptops. After
                                this, Daniel left with an Indian girl who had just come there to see
                                Daniel. After Daniel left, Babu asked me should we fail in our
                                attempt to drive away the lorry, what would I do. I then told him I
                                had no idea. Babu then suggested that we block his lorry and ask the
                                driver of the lorry whether he had borrowed money from the
                                moneylender ‘ah long’. When the driver comes down from
                                the lorry to answer, we should then scotch-tape his mouth, both his
                                hands and legs, and take him along in the lorry in the front cabin,
                                and drive away his lorry. Babu then said he would follow us in his
                                lorry and after the unloading had been done, we could leave the
                                lorry and driver somewhere and go away. All these serious matters
                                were discussed during the drinking session that night after Daniel
                                left. Christopher was with me during the discussion.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The case put forth by Bala</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As Bala has decided not to proceed with this appeal in so far as his
                    conviction is concerned (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> below), we

                    the court below. We shall, instead, only set out the Judge’s summary of
                    these submissions, which was as follows (see the GD at [30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Bala] admitted that he struck [Wan] with the baseball bat. Counsel
                        submitted that the defence of [Bala] was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    there was no intention to commit murder and to cause the death of
                                [Wan] as the plan was to rob [Wan] of the 2,700 handphones;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    there was a sudden fight between him [<em>ie</em>, Bala] and [Wan] near the grass verge of Changi
                                Coast Road which arose when [Wan] provoked [Bala] with abusive
                                [language] and expletives which led to [Bala] … assaulting
                                [Wan] which are [<em>sic</em>] within the
                                Exceptions 1 and 4 of Section 300 of the Penal Code
                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defence also contended that it was not within the contemplation of all
                        three accused persons [<em>ie</em>, the Appellants] to
                        use the baseball bat to assault Wan and to cause him serious injury. It was
                        also submitted that certain police statements (exhibits 251, 255 and
                        257) made by [Bala] ought to be disregarded as: the statements were not
                        verified by [Bala]; the statements were not recorded with the assistance of
                        an interpreter; the statements were paraphrased by the recording officer and
                        in some instances, the recorder even used words of his own; and/or the
                        recorder did not administer a warning that the statements were recorded in
                        the course of a murder investigation. Counsel urged the court to acquit
                        [Bala].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The case put forth by Daniel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Daniel’s submissions on the facts at the trial, as summarised by the
                    Judge in the GD, were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    [Daniel] stated in court that sometime in May 2006, [Bala] told him of
                            a plan to “take away” a lorry carrying handphones and
                            laptops out from CAC. He agreed to be part of the plan as he was then in
                            financial straits. [Daniel] testified that the original plan was to
                            simply steal the lorry while the lorry driver was changing his pass at
                            the CAC pass office. This plan however failed when [L]orry 815 did
                            not stop at the pass-office.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    According to [Daniel], after [L]orry 815 failed to stop at the
                            pass-office, [Bala] instructed him to tail the lorry. Somewhere along
                            Changi Coast Road, [Bala] told him to overtake and intercept
                            [L]orry 815. [Daniel] complied. After both [L]orry 815 and
                            [L]orry 9520 had come to a stop, [Daniel] remained in his lorry
                            while [Christopher] and [Bala] alighted. It was through the left side
                            mirror that [Daniel] saw [Bala] holding a baseball bat [<em>ie</em>, the baseball bat] and then striking [Wan]
                            once on the face using the bat. [Daniel] stated that he did not question
                            [Bala] when he was told to tail the 24-footer from the Cargo Complex as
                            [Bala] was elder to him and that he did not do anything to stop
                            [Bala]’s assault on [Wan] as he was shocked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    [Daniel’s] counsel submitted that the only plan [Daniel] was
                            privy to was the plan to snatch [Wan’s] lorry at the CAC
                            pass-office and “there was no pre-arranged plan to beat up [Wan]
                            till he was unconscious”. It was further submitted that the
                            Prosecution had adduced no evidence to show that [Daniel] had a common
                            intention with [Christopher] and [Bala] to cause grievous bodily harm to
                            [Wan]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In relation to the law, the material portions of Daniel’s written
                    submissions in the court below were as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    There is no doubt in the present case that there was no pre-arranged

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>

                            unconscious. He admitted and pleaded guilty to the [CSOF] to escape the
                            murder charge. And [Bala] has also testified that there was no common
                            intention to beat up [Wan] till he was grievously hurt or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    The fact [that] the baseball bat had been placed in the lorry does not

<b><em>Lord Windlesham, writing with great Home Office experience,
                                has said that a minority of defendants convicted of murder have been
                                convicted on the basis that they had an intent to kill:
                                “Responses to Crime.” Vol. 3 (1996) at
                                page 342 n. 29. That assessment does not surprise me. What
                                is the justification for this position? There is an argument that,
                                given the unpredictability [as to] whether a serious injury will
                                result in death, an offender who intended to cause serious bodily
                                injury cannot complain of a conviction of murder in the event of a
                                death. But this argument is outweighed by the practical
                                consideration that immediately below murder there is the crime of
                                manslaughter for which the court may impose a discretionary life
                                sentence or a very long period of imprisonment. Accepting the need
                                for a mandatory life sentence for murder, the problem is one of
                                classification. The present definition of the mental element of
                                murder results in defendants being classified as murderers who are
                                not in truth murderers. It happens both in cases where only one
                                offender is involved and in cases resulting from joint criminal
                                enterprises. It results in the imposition of mandatory life
                                sentences when neither justice nor the needs of society require the
                                classification of the case as murder and the imposition of a
                                mandatory life sentence</em></b>.<b>”</b></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     To sum up, Daniel’s defence was, in essence, that there was no common
                    intention among the Appellants to use the baseball bat to assault or cause
                    grievous bodily harm to Wan. The placing of the baseball bat in Lorry 9520
                        <em>per se</em> did not point to there being such a
                    common intention; at least, Daniel had no such intention. Bala’s assault
                    on Wan with the baseball bat was not in furtherance of the Appellants’
                    common intention to rob Wan, and it also exceeded the scope of that common
                    intention. This defence was rejected by the Judge.</p>

                    the Judge, were as follows (see the GD at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Christopher] testified that he was not privy to the plan to rob the lorry
                        carrying the [Cargo] and that he was merely an ignorant replacement driver.
                        This assertion was corroborated somewhat by [Bala] who testified in court
                        that [Christopher] was a last minute replacement for one
                        “Shankar” who was supposed to be involved in the plan but who
                        could not wake up that particular morning. [Bala] added that
                        [Christopher’s] role was only to send [Daniel] and [Bala] to CAC and
                        nothing more. The reason why [Christopher] made the various incriminating
                        police statements was because during their time in police custody, [Daniel]
                        had disclosed to [Christopher] the contents of his police statements and in
                        his confused [state] of mind, [Christopher] decided to give an account that
                        tallied with [Daniel]’s.</p>

                    a pre-arranged plan (along with Daniel and Bala) to rob Wan had not been proved
                    beyond reasonable doubt. He (Christopher) did not have prior knowledge of any

                                    irrespective of the fact that he might have only played a small

                <em>In Om Prakash v State AIR 1956

                                    tantamount to actual participation in the criminal act. The
                                    court cited the example where a person who is an eye-witness of
                                    the incident is present at the spot as well as [the example of]
                                    a person who is a confederate of the assailant. The former is
                                    not guilty because he is present merely to see the commission of
                                    the crime. On the other hand, the latter is guilty because he is
                                    present for the purpose of seeing that the crime is committed.

                                    renders, he participates in the commission of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As can be seen from para C.3 of the above extract from the
                    Prosecution’s written closing submissions, the Prosecution, in closing its
                    case at the trial, took the position that participation by A and B in the
                    criminal act done by C (<em>ie</em>, the inflicting of
                    fatal injuries on D) was necessary before A and B could be held constructively
                    liable for the offence resulting from C’s criminal act. This submission by
                    the Prosecution clearly contradicted the position set out in its opening
                    statement, which did not mention that participation by Daniel and Christopher in
                    the criminal act giving rise to the offence which they were charged with was
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Confusingly, in its oral closing submissions, the Prosecution appeared to
                    revert to the position set out in its opening statement when it
                        contended:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]espite [the] plethora of evidence presented, [Daniel] continuously
                        harp[ed] on the issue that there was no plan to assault [Wan] … with
                        the baseball bat. … [W]ith respect, <em>the
                            Prosecution’s case against the [Appellants] does not stand or fall
                            on the ability of the Prosecution to prove whether there was a plan to
                            assault [Wan] with the baseball bat</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he critical ingredients that the [P]rosecution is required to
                        prove are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Firstly,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(A)    Does the evidence show that the [Appellants] shared a common
                                intention to commit robbery? …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Now secondly,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(B)    If the answer to … (A) is “Yes”, did [Bala]
                                strike [Wan] with the baseball bat on the head in order to <em>facilitate</em> the robbery that was intended by
                                the [Appellants?] …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">And (C), if the answer to … (B) is “Yes”[,] then
                            the law as it stands … is that [Daniel] and [Christopher] are
                            liable under section 34 of the Penal Code for the criminal act, in
                            other words, murder, in this case, caused by [Bala] <em>as it was done in furtherance of the common intention to commit
                                robbery</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above submission clearly indicates that, according to the Prosecution,
                    participation by Daniel and Christopher in the criminal act done by Bala which
                    gave rise to the offence charged (<em>ie</em>, the criminal
                    act of assaulting Wan) was not a requirement for the purposes of imposing
                    constructive liability on Daniel and Christopher under s 34 as Bala had
                    committed that criminal act “in furtherance of the common
                        intention”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> of all the Appellants to rob Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Thus, it appears that the Prosecution’s final position at the trial was
                    that even though Daniel and Christopher had not participated in the criminal act
                    done by Bala which gave rise to the offence charged, they could be held
                    constructively liable for that offence pursuant to s 34 because Bala had
                    done the criminal act giving rise to that offence in furtherance of the
                    Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan. In the Prosecution’s view,
                    Bala’s assault on Wan was in furtherance of the Appellants’ common
                    intention to commit robbery as it “facilitate[d]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> the robbery in terms of its execution and/or its successful
                    accomplishment (<em>eg</em>, presumably, it enabled the
                    Appellants to avoid being identified by Wan and to escape after removing the
                    Cargo from Lorry 815). Based on the Prosecution’s approach as
                    described in this paragraph, for the purposes of imputing constructive liability
                    to secondary offenders pursuant to s 34, there does not need to be a common
                    intention between C (the actual doer) and A and B (the secondary offenders) to
                    commit the criminal act done by C which gives rise to the offence that A, B and
                    C are charged with; all that is required is that the criminal act committed by C
                    is in furtherance of and is not inconsistent with the criminal act commonly
                    intended by A, B and C. This proposition is said to have been established by the
                    CCA in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> and <em>Neoh Bean Chye and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 164 (“<em>Neoh Bean
                        Chye (CCA)</em>”), and to have been subsequently endorsed
                    and reaffirmed by the CA in, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye and another</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>Lim Poh
                        Lye (CA)</em>”). We shall hereafter refer to this
                    proposition as “the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We shall now examine the findings of fact made by the Judge and his actual
                    decision in respect of Daniel and Christopher. His findings on Bala are not
                    particularly pertinent to our discussion on s 34 as Bala was the actual
                    doer of the criminal act in the present case and, therefore, his liability for
                    the offence of murder would depend solely on the operation of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code
                        (s 300(<em>c</em>) being the particular limb of
                    s 300 which was relied on by the Prosecution).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In dealing with the retracted parts of the Appellants’ statements, the
                    Judge reminded himself that case law required the court to treat those portions
                    of the statements with circumspection (see the GD at [32], citing <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 45 at [84]–[86]). With that caution in mind, the Judge
                    made the following findings of fact against the Appellants:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     There might have been “some discussion among the [Appellants] in
                        relation to hijacking Wan’s lorry at the pass-office” (see the
                        GD at [34]), but the evidence showed that “the plan … had
                        changed by the time of the evening before the crime” (see the GD at
                        [34]). The new plan was to “forcibly take over the goods-laden lorry
                            [<em>ie</em>, Lorry 815] while making sure
                        that the driver thereof [<em>ie</em>, Wan] would be
                        unable to stop them or recognize them” (see the GD at [34]). It was
                        clear to the Appellants that “the new plan had to be executed when
                        [L]orry 815 did not stop at the pass-office and when [Bala] directed
                        [Daniel] to tail the said lorry” (see the GD at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     The assertion by Daniel that the assault on Wan was unexpected and that he
                        (Daniel) had been shocked by it should be rejected in view of, <em>inter alia</em>, the following factors (see the GD at
                        [35]–[36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Daniel was in control of Lorry 9520 when the Appellants tailed
                            Lorry 815;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       it was likewise Daniel who staged the near accident along Changi Coast
                            Road;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Daniel did not mention his alleged shock and fear in any of his
                            statements to the police; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       following the assault on Wan, Daniel (among other things) helped to
                            carry Wan into the passenger compartment of Lorry 815 and
                            subsequently went clubbing and drinking that same evening, which actions
                            “negated the assertion of shock” (see the GD at
                            [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In the circumstances, the Judge held, Daniel “was privy to the
                        robbery plan and … knew that [Wan] would be assaulted as part of the
                        [robbery] plan” (see the GD at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     Christopher was “clearly privy to the robbery plan” (see the
                        GD at [39]). Bala had informed the police that when Christopher drove him
                        and Babu to CAC to survey the place ahead of the robbery, Christopher was
                        aware that there was a plan to steal mobile phones (see the GD at [37]).
                        Also, Daniel’s testimony in court did not support the contention by
                        Christopher that he (Christopher) was an ignorant last-minute replacement
                        driver (see the GD at [37]). Furthermore, Christopher was present at the
                        meeting at the coffee shop in Toa Payoh on 29 May 2006 when the robbery
                        was discussed (see the GD at [38]). His evidence that he had been talking to
                        his girlfriend on his mobile phone instead was not convincing (see the GD at
                        [38]). Similarly, his assertion that he had made incriminating statements
                        against himself so that his statements would tally with Daniel’s
                        statements was “inherently unbelievable” (see the GD at [39]).
                        In addition, his conduct during the robbery showed that he was part of the
                        robbery plan (see the GD at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     Bala satisfied the requirements for liability for the offence of murder as
                        set out in s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code
                            (“s 300(<em>c</em>) murder”). He
                        admitted that whatever injuries were found on Wan’s body had been
                        caused by his assault (see the GD at [41]). In this respect, Dr Teo
                        testified that, in his view, at least 15 blows had been inflicted on Wan and
                        the injuries to Wan’s head were sufficient in the ordinary course of
                        nature to cause death (see the GD at [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     The interception of Lorry 815 and the subsequent assault on Wan by
                        Bala were “clearly premeditated” (see the GD at [43]). As
                        stated by Daniel, Bala took the baseball bat with him when he alighted from
                        Lorry 9520 and tried to hide it behind his left leg (see the GD at
                        [44]–[45]). Also, “the multiple forceful blows inflicted on the
                        unarmed and defenceless [Wan] showed that the assault was nothing short of
                        being cruel” (see the GD at [45]). On those two scores, the defence
                        of sudden fight was clearly not available to Bala (see the GD at
                        [45]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_f"></a>(f)     Bala also could not rely on the defence of provocation. His attack on Wan
                        was clearly premeditated and did not result from his having been deprived of
                        his self-control due to Wan’s alleged aggression (see the GD at [48]).
                        It was highly unlikely that Wan had behaved in a provocative manner
                        as:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       he was outnumbered;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       his alleged aggressiveness was not mentioned in any of the
                            Appellants’ statements to the police; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_37-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       his alleged provocative behaviour was not corroborated by either
                            Daniel or Christopher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the basis of these findings of fact, the Judge concluded that the fact that
                    none of the Appellants had intended to kill or cause the death of Wan did not
                    mean that they could not be convicted of murder. <em>Vis-à-vis</em> Bala, the Judge held that the requirements for him to
                    be made liable for the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    murder were clearly met. The Judge referred to <em>Lim Poh
                        Lye (CA)</em>, where this court reaffirmed the applicability of
                    the principles set out by the Supreme Court of India in <em>Virsa
                        Singh v State of Punjab</em> AIR 1958 SC 465
                        (“<em>Virsa Singh</em>”) apropos the
                    Indian equivalent of s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal
                    Code, which were as follows (see <em>Virsa Singh</em> at
                    [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a
                        case under S. 300 “thirdly” [<em>ie</em>, the Indian equivalent of s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is
                        present;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved[.] These are purely
                        objective investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or
                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.</p>

                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Since, on the facts found by the Judge, Bala had committed
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder, the Judge held that
                    Daniel and Christopher were also guilty of the same offence as they (together
                    with Bala) had a common intention to rob Wan and “knew that violence
                    would be necessary to overpower and incapacitate Wan … in order to
                    facilitate the commission of the robbery” (see the GD at [51]). The Judge
                    added that “[t]he brutal assault [on Wan] was undoubtedly in furtherance
                    of [the Appellants’] common intention to commit robbery of the goods in
                    [L]orry 815” (see the GD at [51]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     To support his ruling that Daniel and Christopher’s knowledge that
                    “violence would be necessary to overpower and incapacitate Wan …
                    in order to facilitate the commission of the robbery” (see the GD at
                    [51]) was sufficient for Daniel and Christopher to be made constructively liable
                    for murder pursuant to s 34, the Judge referred to this court’s
                    judgment in <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em> and said (see
                    the GD at [50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    In <em>Lee Chez Kee v PP</em> [2008] SGCA 20, a

                            trial, the court said (at [253]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Thus, I can now summarise what I regard as the correct interpretation
                            of s 34 of the Penal Code, taking into account the typical
                            requirements to make s 34 of the Penal Code applicable, <em>viz</em>, (a) a criminal act;
                            (b) participation in the doing of the act; (c) a common
                            intention between the parties; and (d) an act done in furtherance
                            of the common intention of the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(a)    Criminal act: Section 34 does not refer to the actual
                                    crime committed only. It is essential to realise that the
                                    expression “criminal act” is not synonymous with
                                    “offence” as defined in s 40 of the Penal
                                    Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(b)    Participation: Presence at the scene of the criminal act,
                                    primary or collateral, need no longer be rigidly insisted on for
                                    s 34 of the Penal Code to apply. In a “twin
                                    crime” situation, there is no need for participation in
                                    the collateral criminal act as well as the primary criminal act;
                                    participation in the primary criminal act would be sufficient
                                    for liability to fix on all subsequent secondary offenders. The
                                    crux of the section is participation, and presence may or may
                                    not provide the evidence for participation; this is a question
                                    of fact to be decided in each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(c)    Proving the common intention: To prove the common intention
                                    between the parties, inferences must be made from the
                                    circumstances of the case to show that the criminal act was
                                    committed in furtherance of a pre-arranged plan such as the
                                    conduct of the parties, the weapons used and the nature of the
                                    wounds inflicted. However, such inferences should never be made
                                    unless [they are] … necessary inference[s] deducible from
                                    the circumstances of the case. All the circumstances, including
                                    antecedent and subsequent conduct, are relevant in inferring the
                                    common intention of all involved.</p>

                                    underpinnings of the Indian Penal Code [<em>ie</em>, the Penal Code 1860 (Act 45 of 1860)
                                    (India)] and the doctrine of common purpose in English law.

                                        offender must subjectively know that one in his party may
                                        likely commit the criminal act constituting the collateral
                                        offence in furtherance of the common intention of carrying
                                        out the primary offence</em>. There is no need [for
                                    the secondary offender] to have known of the actual method of
                                    execution in a murder situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is crucial to note that <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em> was a “twin crime” case –
                    <em>ie</em>, a case where the offenders share a common
                    intention to commit a criminal act (hereafter called a “primary criminal
                    act”) such as breaking into a house to steal and, in the course of doing
                    that criminal act, one of the offenders (<em>ie</em>, the
                    actual doer) commits a different (or collateral) criminal act (hereafter called
                    a “collateral criminal act”) such as inflicting a fatal injury on
                    the occupant of the house with a knife. In a typical “twin crime”
                    case, it is the collateral criminal act – and <em>not</em> the primary criminal act – that the secondary
                    offenders are concerned about as the offence which they are charged with, read
                    with s 34, is the offence resulting from the former (<em>ie</em>, the collateral criminal act). In contrast, in a
                    “single crime” case, the offenders share a common intention to
                    carry out the criminal act actually done by the actual doer (which would be the
                    primary criminal act as just defined), and that criminal act is also the
                    criminal act which gives rise to the offence charged against the secondary
                    offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was in the particular context of a “twin crime” case that
                    this court laid down in <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>
                    (at, <em>inter alia</em>, sub-para (d) of [253]) the
                    additional <em>mens rea</em> requirement which had to be
                    satisfied in order to hold a secondary offender (who might or might not himself
                    have participated in the collateral criminal act done by the actual doer)
                    constructively liable pursuant to s 34 for the offence resulting from the
                    actual doer’s collateral criminal act, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The additional <em>mens rea</em> required of the
                        secondary [offender] is that of a subjective knowledge on the part of the
                        secondary offender in relation to the likelihood of the collateral offence
                        happening. To be more precise, the secondary offender must subjectively know
                        that one in his party <em>may likely</em> commit the
                        criminal act constituting the collateral offence in furtherance of the
                        common intention of carrying out the primary offence. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This <em>mens rea</em> requirement, which we shall
                    hereafter refer to as “the <em>LCK</em>
                    requirement”, refers to subjective knowledge that “the criminal
                    act constituting the collateral offence” (see <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em> at sub-para (d) of [253]) –
                    <em>ie</em>, the collateral criminal act as defined at
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above – may likely be
                    committed, and <em>not simply subjective knowledge that violence
                        may be used</em> in furtherance of the common intention to do the
                    primary criminal act. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>
                    above, the <em>LCK</em> requirement is a restriction on the
                    operation of the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    test. In the light of the decision in <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em>, it is no longer possible for the Prosecution to
                    merely rely on the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    test when it seeks to hold a secondary offender constructively liable pursuant
                    to s 34 for the offence resulting from the criminal act done by the actual
                    doer; instead, the Prosecution must go further and show that the <em>LCK</em> requirement is satisfied. It is necessary to point
                    out at this juncture that the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test, as restricted by the <em>LCK</em> requirement, is relevant only in a “twin
                    crime” situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Reverting to the GD, it should be noted that the Judge held that the <em>LCK</em> requirement was satisfied by reason of the findings
                    set out at [51]–[53] of the GD, which were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    The evidence before me more than sufficed to impute liability [for
                            Bala’s] actions to [Daniel] and [Christopher]. There was clearly a
                            common intention among [the Appellants] to commit robbery. The
                            [Appellants] knew that violence would be necessary to overpower and
                            incapacitate Wan (to the extent [that] he would not be able to resist
                            and to identify them) in order to facilitate the commission of the
                            robbery, even if [Daniel] and [Christopher] were not aware of
                            [Bala’s] “actual method of execution”. The brutal
                            assault was undoubtedly in furtherance of their common intention to
                            commit robbery of the goods in [L]orry 815.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    In <em>Too Yin Sheong v PP</em> [1999] 1 SLR
                            682, the [CA] astutely noted at [27] that “[t]he reason why all
                            are deemed guilty in such cases is, the presence of accomplices gives
                            encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing
                            the act.” [Daniel] and [Christopher] were no doubt <em>participants</em> in the robbery: [Daniel] staged the
                            accident and was acting as a look out [<em>sic</em>] while Wan was being assaulted; [Christopher] directed
                            Wan to [Bala] with full knowledge of the robbery plan and the fact that
                            Wan would be assaulted by [Bala]. There was no expression of horror or
                            surprise on their part after Wan was battered brutally by [Bala].
                            [Daniel] and [Christopher] were calm and purposeful in their actions.
                            They helped to bundle Wan into his lorry before bringing it to the
                            intended destination. [Daniel] was able to drive a stranger’s
                            lorry and yet retained the presence of mind to push Wan’s head
                            down at least twice when [Wan] tried to get up. He was also able to help
                            offload two pallets from [L]orry 815 onto their own lorry at [Car
                            Park A] before Babu arrived. [Christopher] was then able to drive
                            away their lorry with the two pallets to their planned destination.
                            There was no talk about what was going to happen to Wan if they left the
                            badly wounded man in his lorry. Clearly, Wan was just someone they had
                            to get rid of although <em>they did not plan to kill
                                him</em>. Once they had got hold of the goods, they were
                            completely nonchalant about the fate of the obviously badly injured
                            Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    In the circumstances, I was of the view that pursuant to s 34 of
                            the Penal Code, [Daniel] and [Christopher] were liable for the actions
                            of [Bala] in the same manner as if the acts were done by them and that
                            all [of the Appellants] were equally culpable.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellants knew that violence would be used to incapacitate Wan in
                        order to facilitate the commission of the robbery, although Daniel and
                        Christopher were not aware of (<em>ie</em>, they did
                        not know) the “actual method of execution” (see the GD at
                        [51]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     Wan was brutally assaulted by Bala in furtherance of the Appellants’
                        common intention to commit robbery;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     Daniel participated in the robbery by staging the near accident along
                        Changi Coast Road and by acting as a lookout while Wan was being
                        assaulted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_e"></a>(e)     Christopher participated in the robbery by directing Wan to Bala after Wan
                        alighted from Lorry 815, knowing that Wan would be assaulted by Bala;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_f"></a>(f)     the Appellants had not planned to kill (<em>ie</em>,
                        to cause the death of) Wan (see the GD at [40] and [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It is also crucial to note that although the Judge was of the view that the
                    Appellants knew that violence would be necessary in order to facilitate the
                    commission of the robbery (see the GD at [50]) and that Daniel and Christopher
                    knew that Wan would be assaulted as part of the robbery plan (see the GD at,
                    respectively, [36] <em>vis-à-vis</em> Daniel and [52]
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Christopher), he <em>did not</em> ultimately find as a fact that the Appellants had a
                    common intention to knock Wan unconscious, let alone a common intention to do so
                    by (specifically) hitting him on the head. Instead, the Judge found as a fact
                    that the Appellants had no plan (<em>ie</em>, no common
                    intention) to kill Wan or cause his death, and stated the Appellants’
                    common intention solely in terms of a “common intention to commit
                    robbery” (see the GD at [51]). A final point to note is that the Judge
                    made express findings of participation by Daniel and Christopher only in
                    relation to the <em>robbery</em>, and <em>not</em> in relation to the <em>assault on
                        Wan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The hearings before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the first hearing of this appeal on 13 November 2008, counsel for the
                    Appellants informed us that their clients did not wish to proceed with the
                    appeal and applied for leave to withdraw the appeal. However, having read the
                    record of proceedings (“the RP”), including the GD, it was our
                    view that the correctness of the convictions of Daniel and Christopher merited
                    further consideration, given the Judge’s specific finding that the
                    Appellants had not planned to kill or cause the death of Wan in carrying out the
                    robbery. As both Daniel and Christopher were adamant in withdrawing the appeal
                    in so far as their convictions were concerned, we appointed their respective
                    counsel as <em>amicus curiae</em> to address us on the
                    merits of the appeal <em>vis-à-vis</em> their convictions.
                    The hearing was then adjourned to a later date. Subsequently, in a letter dated
                    15 January 2009, Daniel, through his counsel, informed the court of his
                    decision to proceed with the appeal in relation to his conviction.
                    Christopher’s counsel continued to act for Christopher as though they had
                    been instructed to proceed with the appeal where his conviction was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     At the second hearing of this appeal on 9 April 2009, Bala maintained his
                    decision to withdraw the appeal in so far as his conviction was concerned. After
                    hearing the submissions of counsel for Daniel and counsel for Christopher as
                    well as the Prosecution’s submissions, we reserved our judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The submissions by Daniel and Christopher on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Daniel’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The main submissions by Daniel against his conviction were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge placed too much weight on the retracted parts of the
                        Appellants’ statements and too little or no weight on the
                        Appellants’ oral evidence at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge erred in law and in fact in failing to apply the correct test
                        for imposing constructive liability under s 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge failed to properly consider and give due weight to the evidence
                        adduced by or on behalf of Daniel that he did not do any act in furtherance
                        of any common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Judge erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider
                        Babu’s evidence, which contradicted the CSOF that Babu had earlier
                        unreservedly admitted to at his trial (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above). This contradiction raised doubts as to whether
                        Wan’s death was caused in furtherance of the Appellants’ common
                        intention to commit robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Judge erred in law and in fact in convicting Daniel of murder on the
                        basis that he had prior knowledge of the planned assault on Wan. The only
                        plan which the Appellants had in common was to commit robbery by driving
                        away Wan’s lorry (<em>ie</em>, Lorry 815)
                        with the Cargo on board; Bala alone subsequently changed the plan and caused
                        Wan’s death without the participation of Daniel and
                        Christopher.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_f"></a>(f)     The requirements for constructive liability to be imposed under s 34,
                        as laid down in <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>, were
                        not satisfied as Daniel did not have subjective knowledge that Bala, in
                        furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to commit robbery,
                        might likely cause Wan’s death by beating Wan until he was almost
                        unconscious. Further, Daniel did not participate in the assault on
                        Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In his oral submissions, counsel for Daniel contended that the
                    Appellants’ common intention, if any, did not go beyond an agreement to
                    rob. He argued that even if Daniel knew that Bala had the baseball bat with him
                    at the material time, it did not necessarily follow that he knew that Bala would
                    use the baseball bat to inflict on Wan bodily injury which was sufficient in the
                    ordinary course of nature to cause death (hereafter referred to as
                        “s 300(<em>c</em>) injury”). Counsel
                    also contended that no medical evidence was adduced as to the degree of force
                    necessary to either render a person unconscious or inflict on him
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Christopher’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The main submissions by Christopher against his conviction were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge erred in fact and in law in relying on the retracted parts of
                        the statements made by Bala and Daniel, which incriminated Christopher. In
                        this connection, the Judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       did not place adequate weight on the reasons given by Daniel as to why
                            he had initially falsely incriminated himself and Christopher in respect
                            of Bala’s assault on Wan;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       did not give adequate weight to the explanation by Bala as to why he
                            had falsely claimed in his statements to the police that Daniel and
                            Christopher were the ones who had assaulted Wan; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       did not state what weight he placed on the retracted parts of the
                            statements of Bala and Daniel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge erred in fact and in law in not placing any weight on that part
                        of the evidence of Bala and Daniel which corroborated Christopher’s
                        evidence. In this connection, the Judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       ignored the evidence of Bala and Daniel (in particular, the evidence
                            of the former, who had no motivation to lie), which exculpated
                            Christopher;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       erred in failing to find that Christopher was not aware of a
                            pre-arranged plan to commit robbery as he had only been asked to drive
                            Lorry 9520 to a designated spot; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       erred in failing to find that Christopher could not have anticipated
                            that violence would be used in furtherance of the Appellants’
                            common intention to commit robbery and that Bala would assault Wan
                            using, specifically, the baseball bat.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge erred in finding that the retracted parts of Christopher’s
                        statements were true and in failing to place adequate weight on
                        Christopher’s oral testimony at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Judge erred in law in failing to explain clearly his reasons for
                        convicting Christopher of murder under s 302 of the Penal Code read
                        with s 34 and, in particular, in failing to explain the relevance of
                            <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em> as the basis for
                        imputing constructive liability to Christopher for the murder arising from
                        the criminal act committed by Bala (<em>viz</em>, the
                        assault on Wan).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Judge erred in fact and in law in imputing constructive liability to
                        Christopher for the murder arising from the criminal act committed by Bala
                        as Christopher had not participated in that criminal act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Judge erred in finding that Christopher shared the common intention to
                        commit robbery as Christopher had been involved only as a last-minute
                        replacement driver. Furthermore, the Judge erred in finding that Christopher
                        had subjective knowledge that there was a likelihood of violence being
                        committed against Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In his oral submissions, counsel for Christopher argued that the Judge should
                    not have relied on the retracted parts of Christopher’s statements to find
                    Christopher guilty of murder as Daniel and Bala, who had implicated him in the
                    robbery, had subsequently retracted the incriminating parts of their statements.
                    Counsel emphasised that Christopher had not known about the robbery plan or any
                    plan to assault Wan so as to render him unconscious as Christopher had stepped
                    in merely as a last-minute replacement driver. Counsel also submitted that since
                    Daniel and Christopher had the opportunity to discuss between themselves what
                    they would tell the police (a fact which the Prosecution did not challenge), the
                    Judge should have given little or no weight to their admissions in relation to
                    their roles in the alleged plan to rob Wan and to beat him up so as to
                    facilitate the commission of the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s submissions on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Prosecution’s main submissions on appeal can be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     The offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder had been
                        made out <em>vis-à-vis</em> Bala, and none of the
                        defences for murder was applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     The evidence against Daniel and Christopher showed that they had prior
                        knowledge of a plan to commit robbery of mobile phones which were being
                        transported as well as to assault the driver of the targeted lorry with the
                        baseball bat until he was unconscious so as to facilitate the commission of
                        the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     Daniel and Christopher did not provide any satisfactory explanation for
                        retracting the incriminating parts of their statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>(d)     Daniel and Christopher clearly participated in the offence of murder (in
                        respect of which they were charged) as well as the offence of robbery (in
                        respect of which they were not charged).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_e"></a>(e)     The evidence showed that “[Daniel] was aware that [Wan] might be
                        badly assaulted in [the course of] the robbery and might receive a bodily
                        injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                            death”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> and that Christopher was aware that the baseball bat
                        “might be used”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> to assault Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the conviction of Bala</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Even though Bala decided, at the hearing before this court on 13 November
                    2008, not to proceed with the present appeal in so far as his conviction was
                    concerned (a decision which he subsequently confirmed at the hearing before us
                    on 9 April 2009), it is incumbent on this court to nonetheless consider
                    whether Bala’s conviction was correct both in law and in fact as it formed
                    the foundation for the convictions of Daniel and Christopher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder is defined
                    in the Penal Code as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>300</b>.    Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is
                            murder —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    if it is done with <em>the intention of causing
                                    bodily injury</em> to any person, <em>and
                                    the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the
                                    ordinary course of nature to cause death</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Having regard to the evidence, and applying the test set out in <em>Virsa Singh</em> (“the <em>Virsa
                        Singh</em> test”) (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    above), we are of the view that Bala was properly convicted of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder as he had intentionally
                    inflicted on Wan, using the baseball bat, s 300(<em>c</em>) injury which caused the death of Wan (see the evidence of
                    Dr Teo as summarised at [41] of the GD). We accordingly affirm the
                    Judge’s conviction of Bala for murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For completeness, we should state that the defences relied on by Bala
                        (<em>viz</em>, the defences of sudden fight and
                    provocation), which the Judge rejected (see sub-paras (e) and (f) of
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above), were correctly rejected on
                    the evidence. In our view, the circumstances and the manner in which Wan was
                    assaulted indicated that the defences of sudden fight and provocation were
                    clearly inherently improbable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The convictions of Daniel and Christopher</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Key issues to consider <em>vis-à-vis</em> Daniel
                and Christopher</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Turning now to Daniel and Christopher’s convictions, in our view, the
                    Judge’s findings that (a) Daniel and Christopher, together with Bala,
                    had a common intention to rob Wan and (b) Daniel and Christopher
                    participated in the robbery cannot be challenged on the evidence. Having regard
                    to these finding as well as the Judge’s findings mentioned at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>–<a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> and <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above, the
                    key issues to be considered in this appeal are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, whether Bala’s assault on Wan was in furtherance of the
                        Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan
                        (“Issue (a)”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, whether the <em>LCK</em> requirement was
                        satisfied with respect to Daniel and Christopher on the evidence
                        (“Issue (b)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We shall now examine these issues <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (a): Was Bala’s assault on Wan in furtherance of the
                Appellants’ common intention?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Issue (a) –
                    <em>viz</em>, whether Bala’s assault on Wan was in
                    furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan – is a
                    question of fact. The Judge held at [51] of the GD that “[t]he
                    [Appellants] knew that violence would be necessary … to facilitate the
                    commission of the robbery”, and that “[Bala’s] brutal
                    assault was undoubtedly in furtherance of [the Appellants’] common
                    intention to commit robbery of the goods in [L]orry 815” (see,
                    likewise, [51] of the GD). The question which we have to consider is whether
                    this finding is correct, <em>ie</em>: was the Judge right
                    to hold that Bala’s brutal assault on Wan was <em>in
                        furtherance of</em> the Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan
                    because it <em>facilitated</em> the robbery?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     We have grave doubts about the correctness of this finding by the Judge in the
                    light of the fact that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Judge found that the Appellants had a common intention to rob Wan, but
                        had no common intention to kill him or cause his death; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Judge did not make any finding that the Appellants had a common
                        intention to knock Wan unconscious, let alone a common intention to do so by
                        hitting his head with the baseball bat (<em>ie</em>,
                        let alone a common intention to cause a specific injury to Wan).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the circumstances, we find it difficult to accept that Bala’s assault
                    on Wan to facilitate the robbery was in furtherance of the Appellants’
                    common intention to rob Wan. Certainly, it can be said that Bala’s assault
                    on Wan furthered the robbery and contributed to its success. But, Daniel and
                    Christopher might not necessarily have agreed to carry out the robbery at all
                    costs, to the extent, for example, of causing Wan grievous hurt or killing him.
                    There was no finding in the present case that Daniel and Christopher had a
                    common intention with Bala to assault Wan in the way that Bala actually did. The
                    Judge found that Daniel and Christopher stood by while Bala assaulted Wan, but
                    he stopped short of finding that Daniel and Christopher participated in the
                    assault in some way. In the light of these findings, we are unable to accept
                    that Bala’s assault on Wan was done in furtherance of the
                    Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan as that common intention did not
                    encompass assaulting Wan. The assault on Wan was inconsistent with or, at least,
                    outside the scope of the Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     To provide a clearer illustration of this point, suppose A and B plan to
                    abduct C with a common intention to rape her: they carry out the abduction
                    successfully and confine C in a flat for the purpose of raping her. A, however,
                    molests C instead of raping her. A’s act of molestation may be said to be
                    consistent with A and B’s common intention to rape C, rape being a more
                    serious sexual offence than sexual molest. Alternatively, suppose A were to
                    sodomise C: it may be argued (although this should not be taken as representing
                    our definitive opinion on this point) that A’s act of sodomy is also
                    consistent with A and B’s common intention to rape C if the common
                    intention to commit rape is pitched at the level of abstraction of a common
                    intention to commit an offence of a sexual nature, like sexual assault or sexual
                    molest. But, suppose A, in the course of raping C, were to suffocate her with a
                    pillow while trying to stop her from screaming: in this situation, it <em>cannot</em> be said that because A’s act of suffocating
                    C furthered the rape of C, the suffocation was therefore in furtherance of A and
                    B’s common intention to rape C. Instead, the suffocation of C would be
                    inconsistent with or, at least, in excess of the criminal act commonly intended
                    by A and B (which was the rape of C).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the context of the requirement of consistency between the criminal act done
                    by the actual doer which gives rise to the offence charged and the criminal act
                    commonly intended by all the above offenders, the above scenario may be compared
                    with the scenario that occurred in <em>Ike Mohamed Yasin bin
                        Hussin v Public Prosecutor</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 596
                        (“<em>Mohamed Yasin</em>”). In that case,
                    the common object of the appellant and one Harun bin Ripin
                    (“HBP”), the appellant’s co-accused at the trial stage, was
                    burglary (see <em>Mohamed Yasin</em> at [6]). As the
                    appellant and HBP were trying to overpower the victim, the victim’s
                    trousers fell off. On seeing this, the appellant was overcome by desire and
                    raped the victim while HBP ransacked the hut (HBP did not participate in the
                    rape at all). While raping the victim, the appellant sat on her chest,
                    fracturing a number of her ribs. When the appellant finished raping the victim,
                    he discovered that she was dead. The evidence showed that the fractures to the
                    victim’s ribs had caused congestion of the victim’s lungs, resulting
                    in a heart attack.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The appellant and HBP were subsequently arrested and charged with committing
                    murder in furtherance of a common intention under s 302 of the Penal Code
                    read with s 34. The trial judges convicted the appellant of murder. In
                    contrast, they acquitted HBP of murder and convicted him of robbery by night
                        (<em>ie</em>, robbery committed after 7.00pm and before
                    7.00am (see s 392 of the Penal Code)) on the ground that the death of the
                    victim was not caused by any act done by the appellant in furtherance of his and
                    HBP’s common object to commit burglary, but was instead caused by an act
                    “done in furtherance of <em>the appellant’s own
                        unpremeditated impulse</em> to have sexual intercourse with the
                    victim” [emphasis added] (see <em>Mohamed Yasin</em>
                    at [6]). Only the appellant appealed against his conviction –
                    <em>ie</em>, the case effectively became a non-s 34
                    case at the appellate stage. The appeal was dismissed by the CCA (see <em>Mohamed Yasin bin Hussin v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 218). The appellant then appealed further to
                    the Privy Council, which held (in <em>Mohamed Yasin</em>)
                    that the appellant had not intended to cause the victim the type of injury which
                    was in fact caused (<em>viz</em>, fracture of the ribs).
                    Lord Diplock, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council,
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    … The lacuna in the Prosecution’s case which the trial
                            judges overlooked was <em>the need to show that, when the
                                [appellant] sat forcibly on the victim’s chest in order to
                                subdue her struggles, he intended to inflict upon her the kind of
                                bodily injury which, as a matter of scientific fact, was
                                sufficiently grave to cause the death of a normal human being of the
                                victim’s apparent age and build even though he himself may not
                                have had sufficient medical knowledge to be aware that its gravity
                                was such as to make it likely to prove fatal</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    There was no finding of fact by the trial judges that this was the
                            appellant’s intention; nor, in their Lordships’ view, was
                            there any evidence upon which an inference that such was his intention
                            could have been based. … [T]o fall on someone’s chest, even
                            forcibly, is something which occurs frequently in many ordinary sports,
                            … and though it may cause temporary pain, it is most unusual for
                            it to result in internal injuries at all, let alone fatal
                            injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Privy Council thus set aside the appellant’s conviction for
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder and substituted it with a
                    conviction for the offence under s 304A of the Penal Code of causing death
                    by doing a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Although <em>Mohamed Yasin</em> did not involve s 34
                    at the appellate stage (both before the CCA and before the PC), it was a
                    s 34 case before the High Court, where HBP was acquitted of murder. Given
                    the decision of the Privy Council that the appellant was also not guilty of
                    murder, both the High Court’s decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> HBP and the Privy Council’s decision <em>vis-à-vis</em> the appellant were consistent with the
                    principle that the appellant and HBP should not be held liable for murder under
                    s 302 of the Penal Code read with s 34 as they did not have a common
                    intention to inflict on the victim the specific injury which caused her death.
                    Suppose, however, that in <em>Mohamed Yasin</em>, HBP had
                    also been overcome by sexual desire upon seeing the victim’s trousers fall
                    off and had spontaneously formed a common intention with the appellant to rape
                    the victim, and had subsequently been charged with the offence of murder under
                    s 302 of the Penal Code read with s 34: in that scenario, it can be
                    inferred from the reasoning of the Privy Council that it would have ruled that
                    the appellant’s criminal act of fracturing the victim’s ribs was
                    inconsistent with or, at least, in excess of the criminal act commonly intended
                    by the appellant and HBP (<em>viz</em>, forcible sexual
                    intercourse with the victim), and would not have held HBP constructively liable
                    for murder under s 302 read with s 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Reverting to the facts of the present case, the Judge held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     all the Appellants “knew that violence would be necessary to
                        overpower and incapacitate Wan (to the extent [that] he would not be able to
                        resist and to identify them) in order to facilitate the commission of the
                        robbery” (see the GD at [51]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     Daniel “knew that [Wan] would be assaulted as part of the [robbery]
                        plan” (see the GD at [36]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     Christopher likewise had “full knowledge of … the fact that
                        Wan would be assaulted by [Bala]” (see the GD at [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In our view, knowledge is not the same as intention (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>–<a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> below), and, therefore, the presence of the knowledge found
                    by the Judge was insufficient to justify the conclusion that there was a common
                    intention among the Appellants to use violence against Wan. Bala himself might
                    have had such an intention (having regard to the fact that he was the one who
                    assaulted Wan during the robbery as well as to the manner in which he carried
                    out that assault), but it cannot be said that Daniel and Christopher would
                    necessarily have shared this intention. It follows that the ruling by the Judge
                    that Bala’s criminal act was in furtherance of the Appellants’
                    common intention to rob Wan was not supported by his findings of fact. In this
                    regard, we note that in <em>Rex v Vincent Banka &amp;
                        Anor</em> [1936] MLJ 53 (“<em>Vincent
                        Banka</em>”), where one of the two accused stabbed the victim
                    to death in the course of a robbery (it was not clear from the evidence which of
                    the accused actually inflicted the fatal wound on the victim), Huggard CJ
                        <em>rejected</em> the following argument by the
                    Prosecution (at 54):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]nasmuch as the fatal wound was inflicted in carrying out a common
                        intention on the part of both accused to rob the [victim] – in other
                        words, a common intention to commit a crime involving violence – it
                        was immaterial which of the two had inflicted the wound, and … by
                        virtue of section 34 of the Penal Code[,] both the accused were equally
                        guilty of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue (b): Was the <em>LCK</em> requirement
                satisfied with respect to Daniel and Christopher on the evidence? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Turning now to Issue (b) (<em>viz</em>, whether the
                        <em>LCK</em> requirement was satisfied in respect of
                    Daniel and Christopher on the evidence), we noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above) that although the Judge found that the
                    Appellants knew that violence would be necessary in order to facilitate the
                    commission of the robbery and that Daniel and Christopher knew that Wan would be
                    assaulted as part of the robbery plan, he ultimately found that the Appellants
                    had not planned to kill Wan or cause his death. In our view, these two findings
                    are insufficient to satisfy the <em>LCK</em> requirement.
                    There was no finding that Daniel and Christopher had subjective knowledge that
                    Bala might likely commit the criminal act actually committed which resulted in
                    the offence with which the Appellants were charged. In our view, these two
                    findings are a far cry from a finding that Daniel and Christopher subjectively
                    knew that Bala might likely inflict s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    injury on Wan in furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to commit
                    robbery. Indeed, since (as the Judge held at [40] and [52] of the GD) the
                    Appellants had no intention to either kill Wan or cause his death, there would
                    have been no cause or reason for Daniel and Christopher to suspect, much less
                    subjectively know, that Bala might likely inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on Wan in furtherance of the Appellants’ common
                    intention to rob Wan. In short, the evidence does not establish beyond
                    reasonable doubt that Daniel and Christopher subjectively knew that Bala might
                    likely cause Wan s 300(<em>c</em>) injury in
                    furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to commit robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The evidence is clear that Daniel and Christopher stood by (or, to be more
                    precise where Daniel is concerned, waited in Lorry 9520) silently –
                    and, according to Daniel’s testimony, helplessly – while Bala
                    assaulted Wan. In our view, the fact that neither Daniel nor Christopher did
                    anything to stop Bala from assaulting Wan so viciously does not entail that they
                    therefore subjectively knew that Bala might likely inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on Wan in furtherance of the Appellants’
                    common intention to commit robbery. The Judge’s finding that the
                    Appellants had not planned to kill Wan or cause his death would support the
                    inference that Daniel and Christopher did not have subjective knowledge that
                    Bala might likely inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on
                    Wan in furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan. This
                    might also explain their passivity at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The next point which we need to consider is whether it may be argued that all
                    that is needed to satisfy the <em>LCK</em> requirement in
                    the present case (which involves, specifically, the offence of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder) is proof that Daniel and
                    Christopher had subjective knowledge that some form of <em>hurt</em> (whether simple or “grievous” within the
                    meaning of s 320 of the Penal Code) might likely be caused to Wan in
                    furtherance of the Appellants’ common intention to commit robbery. This
                    would not be an unreasonable approach, having regard to the established law
                        (<em>ie</em>, the law laid down in <em>Virsa Singh</em> (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    above)) on how s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code
                    should be applied. In other words, what we need to consider is: how specific
                    must the secondary offender’s subjective knowledge of the collateral
                    criminal act which might likely be committed by the actual doer be for the
                    purposes of satisfying the <em>LCK</em> requirement? To
                    answer this question (which we shall hereafter refer to as “the
                    ‘degree of specificity’ question” for convenience), we must
                    first examine this court’s decision in <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In that case, the accused (“LCK”) and two others
                    (“Too” and “Ng”) set out to rob the deceased at his
                    house. In the course of the robbery, LCK stabbed the deceased. The deceased was
                    then tied up by Too and LCK, and was later strangled by one of them. LCK was
                    charged with murder committed in furtherance of a common intention to rob the
                    deceased. LCK denied that he had any part in the killing of the deceased, and
                    claimed that he had left the house thinking that the deceased was alive. The
                    trial judge convicted LCK of the charge even though he did not make a finding
                    that there was a common intention to kill the deceased (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Chez Kee</em> [2007]
                    1 SLR(R) 1142). LCK, in other words, was treated as though he was the
                    actual doer and s 34 was not applied to determine his guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     LCK appealed against his conviction. On appeal, this court doubted whether it
                    was LCK who had strangled the deceased and, accordingly, decided to consider
                    whether LCK’s conviction could be sustained if s 34 were applied,
                    even though the trial judge did not find that there was a common intention
                    between Too and LCK to strangle the deceased (the strangulation of the deceased
                    was the criminal act which gave rise to the offence charged in <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>). This court held (<em>inter alia</em>) as follows where the law on s 34 was
                    concerned:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     In a “twin crime” case, it was not necessary for the
                        secondary offender (<em>ie</em>, LCK in the case of
                            <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>) to participate in
                        the collateral criminal act giving rise to the offence charged (which, in
                            <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>, was the offence of
                        murder). Instead, it sufficed so long as he participated in the primary
                        criminal act which was commonly intended by all the offenders (<em>ie</em>, the acts constituting the robbery of the
                        deceased in the case of <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     The putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test was
                        good law. For s 34 to apply in a “twin crime” case, it
                        was not necessary for there to be a common intention among all the offenders
                        to do the collateral criminal act done by the actual doer. However, before
                        the secondary offender could be held constructively liable for the offence
                        resulting from that collateral criminal act, the secondary offender must
                        have subjective knowledge that the actual doer <em>might
                            likely</em> commit that criminal act (<em>ie</em>, the collateral criminal act giving rise to the offence
                        charged) in furtherance of all the offenders’ common intention to
                        carry out a primary criminal act (see <em>Lee Chez
                            Kee (CA)</em> at sub-para (d) of [253] (also reproduced
                        earlier at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On the facts of <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>, this
                    court held by a majority, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    requirement set out at sub-para (b) of the preceding paragraph (<em>ie</em>, the <em>LCK</em> requirement),
                    that LCK had the requisite subjective knowledge. In this regard, it was held,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that LCK “must …
                    have appreciated that the deceased would have to be <em>killed</em> to protect [the] identities [of LCK and Too] in the light
                    of the harm they had inflicted on him” [emphasis added] (see <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em> at [262]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Reverting to the “degree of specificity” question posed at
                        <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> above, where a secondary offender
                    is charged with murder read with s 34, the particular criminal act whose
                    likely commission he must have subjective knowledge of, for the purposes of the
                        <em>LCK</em> requirement, depends on the particular
                    limb of s 300 which is invoked by the Prosecution. Section 300, part
                    of which was quoted earlier (at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above),
                    defines the offence of murder as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>300</b>.    Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is
                            murder —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention
                                of causing death;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as
                                the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to
                                whom the harm is caused;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any
                                person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient
                                in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently
                                dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such
                                bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act
                                without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such
                                injury as aforesaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As a matter of statutory interpretation, the four limbs of s 300 of the
                    Penal Code indicate that the criminal act which gives rise to the offence of
                    murder may take on one of four distinct criminal acts. Accordingly, where
                    s 34 is invoked to hold a secondary offender constructively liable for
                    murder, the subjective knowledge which he must have is subjective knowledge of
                    the likely commission of the criminal act that is relevant to the particular
                    limb of s 300 relied upon by the Prosecution. At first glance, this may
                    seem to require fine distinctions to be drawn between the various limbs of
                    s 300 for the purposes of imposing constructive liability on a secondary
                    offender pursuant to s 34. We are, however, of the view that in terms of
                    application, there is, in substance, little or no difference between subjective
                    knowledge of the likelihood of one of the criminal acts in s 300 occurring
                    and subjective knowledge of the likelihood of another of those criminal acts
                    occurring. Subjective knowledge that any one of the criminal acts set out in
                    s 300 might likely be committed, whether that criminal act is the one
                    delineated in s 300(<em>a</em>), s 300(<em>b</em>), s 300(<em>c</em>) or
                        s 300(<em>d</em>), is in effect simply subjective
                    knowledge that the victim might likely be killed or fatally injured, whatever
                    the specific criminal act concerned might be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Leaving aside subsections (<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>) and (<em>d</em>) of s 300
                    (all of which are not applicable in the present case as Bala’s criminal
                    act was found to have given rise to the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder specifically), where a secondary offender is sought to
                    be made constructively liable pursuant to s 34 for s 300(<em>c</em>) murder, the <em>LCK</em>
                    requirement would be satisfied only if the secondary offender has subjective
                    knowledge of the likelihood of the victim receiving, specifically, <em>s 300(</em>c<em>) injury</em>. This
                    corresponds to the type of bodily injury which must be inflicted on the victim
                    for the purposes of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder. In this
                    respect, it is <em>not</em> sufficient, in our view, for
                    s 34 to apply if the secondary offender merely has subjective knowledge
                    that the victim might likely suffer <em>an injury</em> (or,
                    for that matter, if the secondary offender shares a common intention with the
                    actual doer to inflict an injury on the victim), and that injury is subsequently
                    shown to be of a type which is sufficiently serious to amount to
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In this regard, it bears emphasis that the <em>mens
                        rea</em> requirement for s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    murder is an <em>element</em> of the <em>substantive offence</em> of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder. In contradistinction, s 34 does not create a
                    substantive offence but merely lays down a principle of liability (see <em>Mahbub Shah v Emperor</em> AIR (32)
                    1945 PC 118 (“<em>Mahbub
                    Shah</em>”) at 120), and the <em>LCK</em>
                    requirement is only a <em>factor</em> in determining
                    whether that principle of liability applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Section 34 imputes <em>constructive</em> liability
                    to a secondary offender by reference to the doing of a criminal act by the
                    actual doer in furtherance of a common intention shared by both the actual doer
                    and the secondary offender, whereas s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    imputes <em>direct</em> liability to the actual doer by
                    reference to an intentional act done by him. Different policy considerations
                    apply when imputing direct liability for murder and when imputing constructive
                    liability for that offence. It may be just to hold the actual doer liable for
                    the offence arising from his own actions, but, in our view, it may not be just
                    to hold the secondary offender constructively liable for an offence arising from
                    the criminal act of another person (<em>viz</em>, the
                    actual doer) if the secondary offender does not have the intention to do that
                    particular criminal act. This is especially true of serious offences like murder
                    or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It does not necessarily follow
                    that the <em>Virsa Singh</em> interpretation of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>), which is applicable to the
                    actual doer, is or should be equally applicable to a secondary offender,
                    especially where the secondary offender did not inflict any injury on the victim
                    at all. In other words, as a principle of criminal liability, it may not be
                    unjust or unreasonable to hold the actual doer liable for s 300(<em>c</em>) murder by applying the <em>Virsa
                        Singh</em> test since (as just mentioned) he was the one who inflicted
                    the s 300(<em>c</em>) injury sustained by the victim.
                    However, it may not be just or reasonable to apply the <em>Virsa
                        Singh</em> test to hold a secondary offender constructively liable for
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder where he had no intention
                    to do the specific criminal act done by the actual doer which gave rise to the
                    offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder, and also did not
                    subjectively know either that that criminal act might likely be committed or
                    that that criminal act would result in s 300(<em>c</em>) injury to the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the present case (and assuming, <em>contra</em> our
                    finding on Issue (a), that the inflicting of s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on Wan by Bala was in furtherance of the
                    Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan), the evidence, as already
                    indicated at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>–<a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above, <em>does not</em>
                    show that Daniel and Christopher had subjective knowledge that Bala might likely
                    inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on Wan in furtherance
                    of the Appellants’ common intention. Accordingly, we answer Issue (b)
                    in the <em>negative</em>; <em>ie</em>,
                    on the evidence, it cannot be said that the <em>LCK</em>
                    requirement was satisfied with respect to Daniel and Christopher. It follows
                    that their convictions for murder have to be set aside (<em>cf</em> the decision in <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em>, where this court upheld (by a majority)
                    LCK’s conviction of murder under s 302 of the Penal Code read with
                    s 34 on, <em>inter alia</em>, the basis that LCK
                    “must … have appreciated that the deceased would have to be killed
                    to protect [the] identities [of LCK and Too] in the light of the harm they had
                    inflicted on him” (at [262])).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the convictions of Daniel and Christopher</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Our decision on Issue (a) and Issue (b) suffices to dispose of this
                    appeal where Daniel and Christopher’s convictions for murder are
                    concerned. These convictions are to be set aside. In substitution, Daniel and
                    Christopher are to be convicted of robbery with hurt under s 394 of the
                    Penal Code read with s 34 (see <a href="#p1_185">[185]</a>
                    below for our directions on sentencing).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The state of the law on s 34</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     At the beginning of this judgment, we expressed concern that more than 130
                    years after the enactment of s 34, the law on this provision is still
                    unsettled (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). We shall now
                    revisit s 34 to see how this state of affairs came about. We start by
                    examining the origins of the phrase “in furtherance of the common
                    intention of all” in s 34 and how it came to be made part of this
                    section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Origins of the phrase “in furtherance of the common intention
                of all”
            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Section 34 can be traced back to s 34 of the Penal Code 1860
                    (Act 45 of 1860) (India) (“the IPC”), which, in its <em>original</em> form, read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a criminal act is done by several persons, each of such persons is
                        liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him
                        alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In 1870, the original version of s 34 of the IPC was amended by the
                    insertion of the phrase “in furtherance of the common intention of
                    all” (see s 1 of the Penal Code Amendment Act 1870 (Act 27 of
                    1870) (India) (“the 1870 IPC Amendment Act”)). It was this
                        <em>amended</em> version of s 34 of the IPC
                    (hereafter referred to as “s 34 IPC” for short) which was
                    introduced into our legislation when the 1871 Penal Code was enacted in 1872.
                    Thus, s 34, as it currently stands in the Penal Code, reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the
                        common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
                        same manner as if the act were done by him alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     According to Hari Singh Gour, <em>The Penal Law of
                        India</em> (Law Publishers (India) Pvt Ltd, 11th Ed, 2000)
                        (“<em>Gour</em>”), the insertion of the
                    phrase “in furtherance of the common intention of all” into the
                    original version of s 34 of the IPC (at vol 1, p 260):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… ma[d]e all the difference between the old section [<em>ie</em>, the original version of s 34 of the IPC]
                        and the new [<em>ie</em>, s 34 IPC as defined at
                            <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above], for without those words
                        the [IPC] would be widely at variance with the English law, <em>where a person not cognizant of the intention of his companions
                            to commit, say, murder, was never liable, though he [might] have joined
                            their company to commit an unlawful act</em>. This view was
                        adopted by the Courts in India, even before the section had been formally
                        amended [citing The Queen v Gorachand Gope and others (1866) Bengal LR
                        Supp 443]. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It is important to note that even under the then prevailing English doctrine
                    of common purpose, an accused had to be “cognizant of the intention of
                    his companions to commit [the offence charged]” (see <em>Gour</em> at vol 1, p 260) before he could be made
                    constructively liable for that offence. The law of common intention, like the
                    law of common purpose, is concerned with the imposition of constructive
                    liability on a secondary offender for an offence (or offences) arising from a
                    criminal act committed by the actual doer. However, the amendment effected by
                    s 1 of the 1870 IPC Amendment Act went further than the English doctrine of
                    common purpose by requiring that the criminal act done by the actual doer which
                    gave rise to the offence charged had to be done in furtherance of the common
                    intention of all the offenders (<em>ie</em>, both the
                    actual doer and the secondary offender(s)), instead of merely requiring the
                    secondary offender to be “cognizant of the intention of his
                    companions” (see <em>Gour</em> at vol 1,
                    p 260).</p>

                    AIR 1925 PC 1 (“<em>Barendra (PC)</em>”), the Privy Council explained the
                    rationale of the amendment effected by s 1 of the 1870 IPC Amendment Act as
                    follows (<em>per</em> Lord Sumner at 9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Really the amendment is an amendment, in any true sense of the word, only
                        if <em>the original object was to punish participants by
                            making one man answerable for what another does, provided what is done
                            is done in furtherance of a common intention</em>, and if the
                        amendment then defines more precisely the conditions under which this
                        vicarious or collective liability arises. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In <em>Ibra Akanda and others v Emperor</em>
                    AIR (31) 1944 Cal 339 (“<em>Ibra
                        Akanda</em>”), Khundkar J provided a similar explanation
                    of the purpose of the amendment made by s 1 of the 1870 IPC Amendment Act.
                    He said (at 361):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[T]he real operation of S. 34 was to take a
                            completed criminal act, and then</em>
<b><em>to attribute the whole of that criminal
                            act</em></b>
<em>, (by which is meant the physical act
                            plus its effects or consequences, e.g., beating plus death or beating
                            plus hurt)</em>, <b><em>to each separate doer of a
                            fractional portion of the act</em></b><em>, (e.g., each
                            person who struck a blow)</em>. The new words [<em>viz</em>, “in furtherance of the common intention of
                        all”] were introduced into the section merely for making express what
                        was already implicit, which was that <b><em>the section would
                            not have its operation of attributing the entire criminal act to one
                            individual doer of a fraction of that act, unless the fractional act was
                            one which helped on a purpose which was shared by all the individual
                            doers</em></b>. The object of the amendment was to make it plain that
                        this rule would have application only where a nexus existed between the
                        minds of individual doers. To express the mental nexus the phrase
                        “common intention” was used, and this it is that has given
                        rise to some confusion in a matter which ought to be essentially simple.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>,
                    V K Rajah JA, proceeding on the premise that the putative
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test was established law,
                    examined the drafting history of s 34 IPC extensively and thereafter
                    formulated the <em>LCK</em> requirement to align s 34
                    with the English doctrine of common purpose. The requirement of knowledge in the
                    English doctrine of common purpose was recently reaffirmed in <em>Regina v Rahman and others</em> [2009] 1 AC 129
                        (“<em>Rahman</em>”), where the House of
                    Lords held that a secondary offender would be made constructively liable for a
                    crime committed by the actual doer if the secondary offender had foresight of
                    what the actual doer might do (as opposed to foresight of the undeclared
                    intention with which the actual doer might commit the crime in question).
                        <em>Rahman</em> was subsequently applied in <em>R v Mendez and another</em> [2010]
                    3 All ER 231 (“<em>Mendez</em>”), where the English Court of Appeal stated that the
                    following proposition was sound in principle as well as consistent with
                        <em>Regina v Powell (Anthony) and Another</em> [1999]
                    1 AC 1 and <em>Rahman</em> (see <em>Mendez</em> at [45] <em>per</em>
                    Toulson LJ):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases where <em>the common purpose is not to kill but to
                            cause serious harm</em>, D [<em>ie</em>, the
                        secondary offender] is not liable for the murder of V [<em>ie</em>, the victim] if the direct cause of V’s death was a
                        deliberate act by P [<em>ie</em>, the actual doer]
                        which was of a kind (a) unforeseen by D and (b) likely to be
                        altogether more life-threatening than acts of the kind intended or foreseen
                        by D. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     At this juncture, it is pertinent to note the Privy Council’s comments
                    in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> as to how the IPC should be
                    construed (at 8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the criminal law of India is prescribed by and, so far as it goes, is
                        contained in the [IPC], that accordingly (as the [IPC] itself shows) the
                        criminal law of India and that of England differ in sundry respects, and
                        that the [IPC] has first of all to be construed in accordance with its
                        natural meaning and irrespective of any assumed intention on the part of its
                        framers to leave unaltered the law as it existed before, are[,] though
                        common-places, considerations which it is important never to forget. It is,
                        however, equally true that the [IPC] must not be assumed to have sought to
                        introduce differences from the prior law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this passage, the Privy Council cautioned that the IPC should be construed
                    in accordance with its natural meaning as the criminal law of India
                    “differ[ed] in sundry respects” (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 8) from English criminal law, and, thus,
                    the IPC should not be assumed to have imported English criminal law as it stood
                    in 1870, when (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above)
                    the original version of s 34 of the IPC was amended (the same applies
                        <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to the construction of the
                    Penal Code). At the same time, the Privy Council indicated (and this
                    consideration likewise applies <em>mutatis mutandis</em> to
                    the provisions of the Penal Code), English criminal law could not be wholly
                    irrelevant where the provisions of the IPC were not clear on their face (see
                    also <em>Ibra Akanda</em> at 359 <em>per</em> Khundkar J).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In our view, the requirement of <em>common intention</em>
                    is, in principle, a <em>more exacting requirement</em> than
                    the <em>LCK</em> requirement of subjective knowledge for
                    the purposes of imposing constructive liability. If A and B have a common
                    intention only to rob C but not to physically harm C, and A joins B in robbing C
                    even though he has subjective knowledge that B has a history of using violence,
                    it does not follow – assuming B does indeed use violence against C in the
                    course of carrying out the robbery – that A had a common intention with B
                    to use violence against C; A might simply have been callous about or indifferent
                    to the fate of C. Even if A was aware that B was carrying a knife with him when
                    they set out together to rob C, a court would be more likely to infer merely
                    that A had subjective knowledge that B might likely use the knife to hurt or
                    kill C in the course of carrying out the robbery, as opposed to inferring that
                    A, by going along with B to rob C in those circumstances, spontaneously formed a
                    common intention with B to rob and, if necessary, to use the knife to hurt or
                    kill C so as to carry out the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The difference between knowledge and intention is succinctly summarised in
                    Glanville L Williams, <em>Jurisprudence by Sir John
                        Salmond</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Limited, 10th Ed, 1947) as
                    follows (at pp 380–381):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[H]e who intends a result usually knows that it will follow, and he who
                        knows the consequences of his act usually intends them. But there may be
                        intention without knowledge, the consequence being desired but not foreknown
                        as certain or even probable. Conversely, there may be knowledge without
                        intention, the consequence being foreknown as the inevitable concomitant of
                        that which is desired, but being itself an object of repugnance rather than
                        desire, and therefore not intended. When King David ordered Uriah the
                        Hittite to be set in the forefront of the hottest battle, he intended the
                        death of Uriah only, yet he knew for a certainty that many others of his men
                        would fall at the same time and place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Admittedly, in certain circumstances, the line between subjective knowledge
                    that a particular criminal act might likely occur and a common intention to do
                    that particular act may be rather thin. Depending on the circumstances of the
                    case, subjective knowledge may be evidence of the existence of a particular
                    intention. Thus, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Chin
                        Guan</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 762 (“<em>Lee Chin Guan</em>”), M Karthigesu J held (at [34])
                    that “[k]nowledge [was] an essential element in coming to a conclusion as
                    to whether there was or was not a common intention”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In a similar vein, the Full Bench of the High Court of Rangoon stated in
                        <em>Emperor v Nga Aung Thein and another</em>
                    AIR 1935 Rang 89 (“<em>Nga Aung
                    Thein</em>”) at 92:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Knowledge is not the same thing as intention. Nevertheless if a man knows
                        that a certain course of action in which he is taking part will under
                        certain circumstances most probably result in death being caused, and still,
                        with that knowledge, persists in his course of action, and death is caused
                        owing to the eventuality which he has foreseen taking place, it may give
                        rise to a legitimate deduction that he intended the causing of death if that
                        eventuality did occur, and he would then be liable as though he had caused
                        that death himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We would also draw attention to the following comments by Sir Barnes
                    Peacock CJ (who was involved in the drafting of the IPC) in the Indian case
                    of <em>The Queen v Gorachand Gope and others</em> (1866)
                    Bengal LR Supp 443 (“<em>Gorachand
                    Gope</em>”) at 456–457:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hen several persons are in company together engaged in one common
                        purpose, lawful or unlawful, and one of … them, without the knowledge
                        or consent of the others commits an offence, the others will not be involved
                        in the guilt, unless the act done was in some manner in furtherance of the
                        common intention. It is also said, although a man is present when a felony
                        is committed, if he take[s] no part in it, and do[es] not act in concert
                        with those who commit it, he will not be a principal merely because he did
                        not endeavour to prevent it or to apprehend the felon. But if several
                        persons go out together for the purpose of apprehending a man and taking him
                        to the thannah [<em>ie</em>, the police station] on a
                        charge of theft, and some of the party in the presence of the others beat
                        and ill-treat the man in a cruel and violent manner, and the others stand by
                        and look on without endeavouring to dissuade them from their cruel and
                        violent conduct, it appears to me that those who have to deal with the facts
                        might very properly infer that they were all assenting parties and acting in
                        concert, and that the beating was in furtherance of a common design.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The key elements of s 34 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Let us now examine the key elements of s 34. As can be seen from the
                    wording of s 34 itself, three elements must be present before constructive
                    liability can be imposed pursuant to this section, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     the criminal act element (see the words “a criminal
                        act”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     the common intention element (see the words “in furtherance of the
                        common intention of all”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     the participation element (see the words “a criminal act …
                        done by several persons”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The criminal act element</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The law on the criminal act element of s 34 is settled. The
                    “criminal act” in s 34 refers to the aggregate of all the
                    diverse acts done by the actual doer and the secondary offenders, which diverse
                    acts collectively give rise to the offence or offences that the actual doer and
                    the secondary offenders are charged with. It is “<em>that</em><b><em>unity of criminal behaviour</em></b>, <em>which results in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if
                        it were all done by himself alone, that is, in a criminal
                    offence</em>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics ] (see

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In the decision of the Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in <em>The King Emperor v Barendra Kumar Ghose</em> AIR 1924
                    Cal 257 (“<em>Barendra (FB)</em>”),
                    Cuming J said (at 312) in respect of the corresponding words in s 34
                    IPC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is impossible to conceive [of] two individuals doing identically the
                        same act. Such a thing is impossible. <b><em>Therefore to have
                            any meaning, the expression “criminal act done by several
                            persons” must contemplate an act which can be divided into
                            parts[,] each part being executed by a different person, the whole
                            making up the criminal act which was the common intention of

                            criminal act may be regarded as made up of a number of acts done by the
                            individual conspirators, the result of their individual acts being the
                            criminal act which was the common intention of them all</em>.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The sentence in bold italics in the above quotation makes it clear that the
                    criminal act done by the actual doer which results in the offence charged must
                    have been commonly intended by all the offenders. The putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test, it may be noted, is
                    inconsistent with this statement because it does not require all the offenders
                    to have a common intention to do the criminal act done by the actual doer which
                    gives rise to the offence charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On appeal from the decision in <em>Barendra (FB)</em>, the Privy Council (<em>per</em> Lord Sumner) approved Cuming J’s statement
                    and restated the meaning of the words “a criminal act” as follows
                    (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 6–9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By S. 33 [of the IPC,] a criminal act in S. 34 includes a series
                        of acts and, further “act” includes omission to act, for
                        example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being done
                        before one’s very eyes. … Read together, [ss 33, 34, 37
                        and 38 of the IPC] are reasonably plain. S. 34 deals with <em>the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse by several
                            persons</em>; if all are done in furtherance of a common
                        intention, each person is liable for the result of them all, as if he had
                        done them himself, for <em>“that act” and
                            “the act” in the latter part of the section must include
                            the whole action covered by “a criminal act” in the first
                            part, because they refer to it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In other words “a criminal act” means <em>that unity of criminal behaviour</em>, <em>which results in something, for which an individual would be
                            punishable, if it were all done by himself alone, that is, in a criminal
                            offence</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     To sum up, according to the above passages from <em>Barendra (FB)</em> and <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, the criminal act referred to in s 34
                    IPC (and, likewise, s 34) must result in an offence which, if done by an
                    individual alone, would be punishable. If all the separate and several acts
                    forming the unity of criminal behaviour (<em>ie</em>, the
                    criminal act) are done in furtherance of a common intention to engage in such
                    behaviour, all the offenders who shared in that common intention are liable for
                    the offence resulting from that unity of criminal behaviour. (We should add that
                    in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, which was a “twin
                    crime” case, the criminal act, so understood, resulted in two different
                    offences, <em>viz</em>, robbery and murder.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     We turn now to the common intention element of s 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The common intention element</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Section 34 attributes constructive liability to joint offenders where the
                    criminal act (as described at <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a>–<a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above) is
                    done by one or more of them “in furtherance of the common intention of
                    all”. It is therefore crucial, in every case, to identify the common
                    intention in furtherance of which the criminal act was done. In this regard, we
                    note that it is often difficult, if not impossible, for the Prosecution to
                    procure direct evidence that a common intention existed between all the
                    offenders. Thus, the existence (or otherwise) of such a common intention must
                    frequently be inferred from the offenders’ conduct and all the other
                    relevant circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In the context of s 34, the common intention of the offenders must be to
                    do something or to achieve some goal or purpose. The crucial question is: to do
                    or achieve what? The putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    test, broadly speaking, rejects the notion that there must be a common intention
                    among all the offenders to do the criminal act done by the actual doer which
                    gives rise to the offence charged; instead, it merely requires the existence of
                    a common intention to engage in some form of criminal conduct, in furtherance of
                    which the criminal act giving rise to the offence charged is done by the actual
                    doer. The question is whether the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test is the correct interpretation of s 34.
                    In our view, this vexed issue of what common intention must be present may be
                    answered by examining two of the leading Privy Council cases on s 34 IPC,
                        <em>viz</em>, <em>Barendra (PC)</em> and <em>Mahbub
                    Shah</em>. These two decisions are still good law in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Before we examine these two Indian cases, we should highlight that s 34
                    refers to “a <em>criminal act</em>” [emphasis
                    added], and not an <em>offence</em>, committed by several
                    persons –
                    <em>ie</em>, strictly speaking, the common intention of all
                    the offenders must be a common intention to do a criminal act, as opposed to a
                    common intention to commit an offence. The fact remains, however, that the
                    criminal act done by the actual doer gives rise to the offence which the
                    secondary offenders are charged with; if that is not in fact the case, s 34
                    would not be applicable at all. Thus, in practical terms, it is in many
                    (although not all) cases immaterial whether the offenders’ common
                    intention is characterised as a common intention to do a criminal act or as a
                    common intention to commit an offence (in this regard, see also <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> below). For instance, suppose A, B and C
                    have a common intention to stab D so as to cause him grievous hurt, and A
                    proceeds to stab D, causing him grievous hurt as a result: in this scenario, the
                    relevant criminal act for the purposes of s 34 is the stabbing of D, while
                    the offence resulting from that criminal act is the offence of causing grievous
                    hurt. Although A, B and C’s common intention should (on a strict, literal
                    reading of s 34) be characterised as a common intention to stab D, we are
                    of the view that it would not be inappropriate to characterise it as, instead, a
                    common intention to cause grievous hurt to D. Similarly, if A, B and C have a
                    common intention to stab D in the heart and A does so, killing D as a result, it
                    is, in our view, immaterial whether A, B and C’s common intention is
                    characterised as a common intention to stab D in the heart or as a common
                    intention to murder D.</p>

        <em>Barendra (PC)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, a group of robbers set
                    out to rob a postmaster and, if necessary, to shoot him to kill should he
                    resist. The postmaster resisted the robbery, and the robbers fired shots at him,
                    one of which killed him. The accused (“BKG”) was charged with
                    murder (the rest of the culprits were not charged as they managed to escape
                    arrest). His defence was that he had told his confederates that he did not want
                    to harm the postmaster and that he had not fired his gun. There was some
                    evidence that BKG might have fired his gun as the bullet that killed the
                    postmaster matched the bore of the gun found in BKG’s possession. However,
                    there was no evidence as to whether the other robbers had used the same type of
                    gun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    At the trial, Page J gave the following direction to the jury (see
                        <em>Barendra (FB)</em> at 260–261):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore in this case if [the robbers] went to that place with <em>a common intention to rob the Post Master and if necessary to
                            kill him</em> and if death resulted, each of them is liable
                        whichever of [them] fired the fatal shot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If you come to the conclusion that [the robbers] came
                            into the Post Office with that intention to rob and if necessary to kill
                            and death resulted from their act, if that be so, you are bound to find
                            a verdict of guilty</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I say if you doubt that it was the pistol of [BKG]
                            which fired the fatal shot, that does not matter. If you are satisfied
                            on the other hand that the shot was fired by one of [the robbers] in
                            furtherance of the common intention, if that be so[,] then it is your
                            duty to find a verdict of guilty</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The jury direction given by Page J was very clear. He did not direct the
                    jury to find BKG guilty if they found that the robbers had shot the postmaster
                    in furtherance of the common intention to rob the postmaster <em>per se</em>. Instead, he directed the jury to find BKG guilty only if
                    they were satisfied that the shot which killed the postmaster had been fired in
                    furtherance of the common intention “to rob <em>and if
                        necessary to kill</em>” [emphasis added] (see <em>Barendra (FB)</em> at 261). The jury direction was
                    predicated on a common intention to kill as the animating intention. (The jury
                    was further directed that for BKG to be found guilty of murder, it was not
                    necessary for him to have fired the fatal shot or to have fired any shot at all,
                        <em>ie</em>, it was not necessary for him to have
                    participated in the shooting (see further <a href="#p1_162">[162]</a> below).) The jury convicted BKG of murder. The conviction
                    was affirmed by the Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta. BKG then appealed
                    to the Privy Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Before the Privy Council, BKG repeated the defence which he had relied on
                    before Page J. Rejecting this argument and upholding the jury direction
                    given by Page J, the Privy Council said (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 6–8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if [BKG] did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be
                        remembered that in crimes as in other things “they also serve who
                        only stand and wait.” …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [BKG’s] story was much more consistent with participation
                        in the actual commission of the crime than with mere bodily presence after
                        previous abetment. Indeed, he says that when he ran away, the others had
                        already disappeared; thus it would seem that he covered their
                        retreat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At any rate, his statement supports presence by way of actual
                        participation in the criminal acts or series of acts by which the post
                        master was killed …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, the Privy Council focused
                    on elucidating the meaning of the phrase “a criminal act” in
                    s 34 IPC, and not the common intention in furtherance of which the criminal
                    act in question was done. But, it is clear from Page J’s jury
                    direction (which was upheld by the Privy Council (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 9)) that the necessary common intention of
                    the robbers was to rob the postmaster <em>and, if necessary, to
                        shoot him to kill</em>. The criminal act done by the robbers was done
                    in furtherance of that common intention. In <em>Ibra
                        Akanda</em>, Khundkar J explained that the common intention of
                    the robbers in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> comprised both a
                    settled intention to commit robbery and a contingent intention to kill,
                        <em>viz</em> (see <em>Ibra
                        Akanda</em> at 358):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he [robbers] set out with an intention to rob, plus an intention to
                        kill provided killing became necessary. …
                        <em>The intention with which they set out was the common
                            intention. It was a wide intention because it embraced both robbery and
                            murder</em>. The intention to kill was a narrower and a contingent
                        intention. They would kill only if killing became necessary. … As I
                        understand the judgment [in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>], it was held that [BKG] was the doer of a
                        fractional act, at the very least, such an act as standing by or guarding
                        the door, and further that he participated in the common intention which, if
                        it was not the narrower contingent intention only to kill, was, at any rate,
                        the wider intention, equally shared by all, which was <em>the
                            absolute intention to rob, plus the contingent intention to kill if need
                            be</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    At 363 of <em>Ibra Akanda</em>, Khundkar J
                    elaborated on the common intention element of s 34 IPC as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I am led to the conclusion that “common
                            intention” cannot be given a constant connotation. What it
                            actually is … varies with the facts of each case</em>.
                            <em>There are cases in which it is identical with the
                            mens rea required for the offence actually committed. There are others
                            in which its horizon is wider, like
                            [</em>Barendra (FB)<em>] and [</em>Indar
                        Singh v Emperor <em>AIR 1933 Lah 819], where the
                            real common intention was to do a criminal act[,] the accomplishment of
                            which might require some other criminal act to be committed</em>.
                        In these cases the mens rea which makes the ancillary act a crime would be
                        regarded as embraced by the common intention, not as a primary intention,
                        but as a secondary and contingent intention, not in the forefront of the
                        conscious mind, but latent or dormant therein. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, the criminal act which
                    formed the basis of the murder charge against BKG was the shooting of the
                    postmaster in furtherance of the common intention to rob him and, if necessary,
                    to shoot him to kill. Both the criminal conduct constituting the robbery and the
                    criminal conduct constituting the shooting were in furtherance of the common
                    intention of all the robbers, which (as just mentioned) was to rob and, if

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Based on the approach laid down in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, the criminal act done by the actual doer
                    which results in the offence charged would be considered to be done in
                    furtherance of the common intention of all the offenders <em>only
                        if</em> that common intention includes an intention <em>to commit the very criminal act done by the actual doer</em>. In the
                    discussion which follows, we shall call this “the <em>Barendra</em> test”.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The meaning of “common intention” was also discussed in
                        <em>Mahbub Shah</em>, where the Privy Council said (at
                    120):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a
                        criminal act. … Under the section, the essence of that liability is
                        to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused
                        leading to the doing of a criminal act in further of such intention.
                            <em>To invoke the aid of S. 34 successfully, it must
                            be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the
                            accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of
                            all</em>; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be
                        imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done
                        by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that
                        common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged
                        plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it
                        should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the
                        pre-arranged plan. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In the above passage, the Privy Council stated that the common intention
                    referred to in s 34 IPC implied the existence of a pre-arranged plan. Later
                    court decisions have clarified that a pre-arranged plan can be formed on the
                    spot just before the commission of the relevant criminal act (see <em>Lee Chin Guan</em> at [36] and <em>Lee Chez
                        Kee (CA)</em> at [161]). The italicised words in the above
                    passage are an iteration of the express words of s 34 IPC itself and do not
                    really provide guidance as to how s 34 IPC is to be applied to the facts of
                    a particular case, in that they leave unexplained what the requisite common
                    intention is. However, the Privy Council provided the explanation in a later
                    part of that same passage when it stated that it was necessary that “the
                    criminal act was done in concert <em>pursuant to the pre-arranged
                        plan</em>” [emphasis added] (see <em>Mahbub
                        Shah</em> at 120). These words clearly suggest that the
                    “pre-arranged plan” must include a common intention to do the
                    criminal act done by the actual doer which gives rise to the offence
                    charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    This is clearer from the factual findings made by the Privy Council in that
                    case. The material facts there were as follows. The accused (“MS”)
                    and his companion (“WS”), armed with guns, went to rescue
                    MS’s cousin (“QS”), who was being assaulted by two men
                    (“HK” and “AD”). MS fired at HK, injuring him, while
                    WS fired at AD, killing him. The Privy Council found that there was no meeting
                    of minds between MS and WS in respect of the shooting of HK and AD. Although
                    both MS and WS intended to shoot HK and AD, they did not form this intention in
                    concert; instead, each of them formed this intention on his own. Thus, on the
                    facts of the case, the Privy Council could not find a <em>common</em> intention between MS and WS to shoot HK and AD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Specifically, what the Privy Council said was as follows (see <em>Mahbub Shah</em> at 121):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships are prepared to accept that [MS] and [WS] had the same
                        intention, viz., the intention to rescue [QS] if need be by using the guns
                        and that, in carrying out this intention, [MS] picked out [HK] for dealing
                        with him and [WS], [AD], but <em>where is the evidence of
                            common intention to commit the criminal act complained
                            against</em>, in furtherance of such intention? Their Lordships
                        find none. <em>Evidence falls far short of showing that [MS]
                            and [WS] ever entered into a premeditated concert to bring about the
                            murder of [AD] in carrying out their intention of rescuing [QS]. Care
                            must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common
                            intention</em>; the partition which divides “their
                        bounds” is often very thin; nevertheless the distinction is real and
                        substantial, and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the words used by the Privy Council in <em>Mahbub
                        Shah</em> indicate that s 34 IPC was interpreted in that case in
                    the same way as it was interpreted in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>. This should not be surprising.</p>

        <em>Vincent Banka</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    
          <em>Vincent Banka</em> is the first major Straits
                    Settlements case on murder committed in furtherance of a common intention. In
                    that case, the appellants (“VB” and “STK”) were
                    charged with murder and robbery with hurt. The evidence showed that VB and STK
                    had planned to rob the deceased (“Chhua”), and, in the course of
                    committing the robbery, one of them had stabbed Chhua with a knife, inflicting
                    on him injuries from which he died. The evidence was inconclusive as to whether
                    it was VB or STK who had: (a) carried the knife; and (b) stabbed Chhua
                    with the knife. It was also unclear whether VB and STK, respectively, had known
                    that the other was carrying a knife. Further, there was no evidence as to
                    whether there had been a common intention between VB and STK that Chhua should
                    be stabbed. VB and STK were convicted of both murder and robbery with hurt; they
                    appealed against their convictions for murder only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    On appeal, one of the grounds of appeal which both VB and STK relied on was
                    that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that for s 34 to apply, they
                    must be satisfied that either: (a) the accused in question inflicted the
                    wounds that resulted in Chhua’s death; or (b) there was an intention
                    common to both accused to cause Chhua’s death and one of them caused such
                    death. The Prosecution, on the other hand, argued that since the fatal wounds
                    were inflicted in the course of carrying out VB and STK’s common intention
                    to commit robbery (an offence involving <em>violence</em>),
                    the issue of whether it was VB or STK who had inflicted those wounds was
                    immaterial, and, by virtue of s 34, both of them were equally guilty of
                    murder (see in this regard the quotation at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The Straits Settlements Court of Criminal Appeal (“the Straits
                    Settlements CCA”), after referring to the law on s 34 IPC as decided
                    in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> and <em>Nga
                        Aung Thein</em>, set aside the murder convictions of VB and STK on the
                    ground that the trial judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury to
                    consider whether, <em>inter alia</em>, VB and STK had a
                    common intention not only to rob, but also to kill. The Straits Settlements CCA
                        (<em>per</em> Huggard CJ) stated the law on
                    s 34 as follows (see <em>Vincent Banka</em> at
                    55–56):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under [the Penal] Code it is essential … that there should be
                        evidence of a common intention, or evidence from which such a common
                        intention can properly be inferred, <em>to commit the act
                            actually committed</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is the duty of the trial Judge, in cases where
                        section 34 of the Penal Code is relied on, to direct the attention of
                        the jury to any evidence from which they may legitimately <b><em>infer the existence of a common intention to commit the
                            criminal act actually committed</em></b>; at the same time making it
                        clear that the question whether or not such common intention existed is a
                        question of fact and is for them to determine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [N]owhere in his summing-up did the learned Judge direct the jury
                        that, even if they were satisfied as to the identity of the two robbers,
                        before they could find the accused guilty of murder by reason of the
                        provisions of section 34 of the [Penal] Code[,] <b><em>they must be satisfied on the evidence that there existed between the
                            two men a common intention not only to rob but also, if necessary, to
                            kill the deceased</em></b><b>[</b><b><em>ie</em></b><b>, Chhua]</b>. … The learned Judge should have
                        told the jury, in effect, that they had first to be satisfied as to the
                        identity of the robbers; that then, if so satisfied, they had to consider
                        the further question whether on the evidence placed before them <b><em>they were satisfied as to the existence of a common intention
                            between the robbers not merely to commit robbery but, if necessary, to
                            kill the deceased</em></b>; that for the purpose of coming to a
                        decision they must consider the evidence against each of the accused
                        separately; and that they could not properly convict either of the accused
                        of murder by reason of section 34 of the [Penal] Code unless they were
                        satisfied that this common intention existed. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Under the terms of that section [<em>ie</em>, s 34], as has already been pointed out, <b><em>there must exist a common intention to commit the crime
                            actually committed</em></b>, and it is not sufficient that there
                        should be merely a common intention to “behave criminally.”

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In our view, the principles stated in the above extract from <em>Vincent Banka</em> are clearly based on the <em>Barendra</em> test. Indeed, given the jurisdictional
                    framework of the Singapore courts in 1936, it was inconceivable for the Straits
                    Settlements CCA to have refused to apply the <em>Barendra</em> test. We also note that the common intention in
                        <em>Barendra (PC)</em> was described in terms of a
                    common intention to commit a <em>criminal act</em>, whereas
                    in <em>Vincent Banka</em>, Huggard CJ used the phrases
                    “the <em>act</em> actually committed”
                    [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics] (at 55), “the
                        <em>criminal act</em> actually committed”
                    [emphasis added] (at 55) and “the <em>crime</em>
                    actually committed” [emphasis added] (at 56) interchangeably. In our
                    view, the different expressions used in <em>Vincent
                        Banka</em> are not material for the reason stated at <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a> above. In any case, Huggard CJ appeared
                    to regard those expressions as having the same meaning; <em>ie</em>, in essence, he held that there had to be a common intention
                    to commit a <em>criminal act</em>. The Straits Settlements
                    CCA set aside the convictions of VB and STK for murder presumably because, in
                    the absence of a finding that the two had a common intention to commit the
                    criminal act done and in the absence of conclusive evidence as to who had
                    actually stabbed Chhua to death, neither of them could be held liable for the
                    offence resulting from that criminal act. In contrast, since there was evidence
                    that VB and STK had a common intention to commit robbery, and since robbery was
                    in fact committed, VB and STK’s convictions for robbery were
                    upheld.</p>

        <em>Rex v Chhui Yi</em>
                [1936] MLJ 142</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    A few months after <em>Vincent Banka</em> was decided,
                    the Straits Settlements CCA in <em>Rex v Chhui Yi</em>
                    [1936] MLJ 142 (“<em>Chhui
                    Yi</em>”) clarified the statement of principle enunciated by
                    Huggard CJ in the former case. The Straits Settlements CCA said (see
                        <em>Chhui Yi</em> at 144):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Court recently considered this question [of common intention] in the
                        case of [<em>Vincent Banka</em>], where the terms of
                        section 34 of the Penal Code were summed up in the following phrase:
                        “Under the terms of that section … there must exist a common
                        intention to commit the <em>crime</em> actually
                        committed, and it is not sufficient that there should be merely a common
                        intention to ‘behave criminally’.”
                        <em>That does not, of course, mean that, in the case of
                            murder, there need have been a common intention actually to kill; but
                            there must have been a common intention to do any of the acts which are
                            described in sections 299 and 300 of the Penal Code and the doing
                            of which, if death results, amounts to murder</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the court did not disagree with
                    Huggard CJ’s formulation, but merely clarified that where s 34
                    was invoked in respect of the offence of murder, the common intention need not
                    necessarily be a common intention to kill because of the terms of ss 299
                    and 300 of the Penal Code (see in particular s 300(<em>c</em>), which requires only an intention to inflict the particular
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury that was in fact caused
                    to the victim; see also our earlier discussion on the various kinds of criminal
                    acts which may give rise to the offence of murder as defined in s 300 and
                    the application of s 34 thereto).</p>

                    successor court, the CCA, decided a number of cases on murder committed in
                    furtherance of a common intention. To the best of our knowledge, all of these

                        and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1971–1973] SLR(R) 63; and (e) <em>Lee Choh

                        Pet</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Two observations may be made with regard to this group of cases. First, as
                    just mentioned in the preceding paragraph, they did not depart from <em>Vincent Banka</em>. Second, Wee CJ presided over the CCA
                    hearings in the last four cases listed in the preceding paragraph. In addition,
                    he presided over the CCA hearing in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em>, the written decision for which was released
                    about four months after the written decision for <em>Lee Choh
                        Pet</em> (whose CCA hearing he likewise presided over) was released.
                    Thus, from 1936 up to 22 July 1972, the law on the common intention element
                    of s 34 can be said to have been settled –
                    <em>viz</em>, for s 34 to apply, it was necessary to
                    prove, in both a “single crime” case and a “twin
                    crime” case (as should be expected), that there was a common intention to
                    commit the criminal act done by the actual doer which gave rise to the offence
                    charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Then, according to Prof Michael Hor (“Prof Hor”) in
                    his article “Common Intention and the Enterprise of Constructing Criminal
                    Liability” [1999] Sing JLS 494 (“the ‘Common
                    Intention’ article”) at pp 496–497, on 22 July
                    1972:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]his seemingly settled position was, all of a sudden, <em>overthrown</em> by the case which can perhaps be described as the
                        mother of all recent decisions on common intention –
                        <em>Mimi Wong [(CCA)]</em>. Although the evidence
                        would have satisfied the <em>Chhui Yi</em>-<em>Banka</em> test [which, according to Prof Hor at
                        p 496, was that “the common intender [could not] be liable for
                        the [collateral] offence, unless he or she also possessed the <em>mens rea</em> required (even if it [was] only
                        conditional) for the [collateral] offence”] the [CCA] said that the
                        intention of the actual doer must be distinguished from the common intention
                        of all. The two intentions need not be the same, but they must be
                        “consistent”. <em>What is clear is that
                            the</em> Mimi <em>formula [ie, the
                            putative</em> Mimi Wong (CCA) <em>test] does
                            not require the common intenders [ie, the secondary offenders] to
                            possess any of the</em> mens rea <em>of the
                            [collateral] offence</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Prof Hor read the decision in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> as having rejected <em>Vincent
                        Banka</em> entirely. In our view, this was highly improbable. If the
                    Straits Settlements CCA in <em>Vincent Banka</em> had
                    applied the <em>Barendra</em> test (which, in our view, it
                    certainly did), it would have been highly unusual for the CCA in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> to have rejected <em>Vincent Banka</em> without giving any explanation for such rejection.
                    The principle of <em>stare decisis</em> would not have
                    permitted even the CCA to treat a decision of the Straits Settlements CCA (which
                    decision was, in principle, binding on the CCA as the successor court of the
                    Straits Settlements CCA) in so cavalier a manner. Indeed, it would also have
                    meant enlarging the <em>Barendra</em> test in a case where
                    it was not necessary to do so. It ought to be remembered that in 1972, there was
                    still a right of appeal to the Privy Council. <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> has also been said to have led to the purported
                    development of two divergent lines of authority on s 34 (see <em>Shaiful Edham</em> at [52] (referred to at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above)). In our view, neither
                    Prof Hor’s interpretation of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> nor the comment at [52] of <em>Shaiful Edham</em> reflects the correct position. Our examination of
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> shows that the CCA in
                    that case in fact applied the law as stated in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>. Let us now turn our attention to <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>, beginning with the High
                    Court’s judgment in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mimi Wong alias
                        Wong Weng Siu and Sim Woh Kum alias Sim Wor Kum</em> Criminal Case
                    No 17 of 1970 (unreported) (“<em>Mimi

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The decisions in <em>Mimi

<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   
        <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>, the first accused, Mimi
                    Wong (“Mimi”), was the mistress of a Japanese man working in
                    Singapore (“Mr W”). Mr W later brought his wife
                    (“Mrs W”) and his children from Japan to live with him. Two
                    weeks after her arrival in Singapore, Mrs W was stabbed to death by Mimi,
                    assisted by her husband, Sim Woh Kum (“Sim”), the second accused.
                    Mimi and Sim were charged with murder committed in furtherance of a common
                    intention. The evidence showed that Mimi and Sim had gone to Mrs W’s
                    house and, whilst there, Sim had thrown detergent into Mrs W’s eyes
                    just as Mimi was about to stab Mrs W. Mimi had then stabbed Mrs W in
                    the neck and the abdomen (cutting the jugular vein and the aorta respectively),
                    causing her to bleed to death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In their grounds of decision, the trial judges held that for s 34 to
                    apply, the Prosecution had to prove three things, namely: (a) that Mrs W
                    was dead; (b) that Mrs W’s death was caused by the act or acts of
                    Mimi and Sim or one of them; and (c) that (see <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em> at 59):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[S]uch act or acts were done in furtherance of their
                            common intention of causing [Mrs W’s] death, or were done in
                            furtherance of their common intention of causing bodily injury to
                            [Mrs W] and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted was
                            sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Vis-à-vis</em> the last-mentioned factor, the trial
                    judges said (see <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> at
                    60–70):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]his was the main issue in this case for we had to decide on
                        the evidence before us whether or not the fatal injuries were inflicted in
                        furtherance of either of the two common intentions already stated [<em>ie</em>, the common intention of causing
                        Mrs W’s death and the common intention of causing bodily injury
                        to Mrs W]. If they were so inflicted[,] then it did not matter which of
                        the two accused inflicted those fatal injuries because both would then be
                        liable for those injuries in the same manner as if the injuries had been
                        inflicted by each of them alone. On the other hand[,] if the fatal injuries
                        were not inflicted in furtherance of either of these two common
                        intentions[,] then it was imperative that we should ascertain, from the
                        evidence before us, which of the two accused inflicted those injuries
                        because in that event[,] only the accused who inflicted those injuries would
                        be liable for causing the death of [Mrs W].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evidence showed that the fatal injuries were knife injuries
                        deliberately inflicted with great force on vital parts of the body. They
                        were not caused accidentally. Death occurred within a matter of minutes.
                        Under the circumstances[,] <em>it was a fair inference that
                            the said injuries were inflicted either with the intention of causing
                            the death of [Mrs W] or with the intention of causing bodily injury
                            to [Mrs W] with a knife</em>[,] and as the injuries actually
                        inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,
                        the person who inflicted those injuries was guilty of murder unless he or
                        she could successfully invoke any of the exceptions [to] … murder
                        laid down in section 300 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The last question which we had to consider was whether or not the knife
                        injuries inflicted on [Mrs W] by [Mimi] were inflicted in furtherance
                        of the common intention of both accused[,] i.e. in furtherance of their
                        pre-arranged plan to cause the death of [Mrs W] or to cause bodily
                        injury to [Mrs W] with a knife and [whether] the bodily injury intended
                        to be caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
                        In other words, was [Sim] a party to the killing of [Mrs W] or was it
                        the sole responsibility of [Mimi]? …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the facts which we have outlined and the reasons we have given,
                        we were convinced that <em>[Sim] shared a common intention
                            with [Mimi] of either causing the death of [Mrs W] or of inflicting
                            bodily injury on [Mrs W] with a knife</em>; that in
                        furtherance of that common intention[,] [Mimi] inflicted with a knife
                        serious injuries on [Mrs W] which resulted in her death; that the
                        injuries so inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
                        cause death[;] and that by causing the death of [Mrs W] in those
                        circumstances[,] both accused were guilty of the offence of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In essence, the trial judges concluded on the facts that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mimi and Sim had a common intention to either cause Mrs W’s
                        death or inflict bodily injury on Mrs W with a knife; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_b"></a>(b)     in furtherance of that common intention, Mimi had inflicted on Mrs W,
                        with a knife, injuries which constituted s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The trial judges convicted both Mimi and Sim of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    It can be seen from the trial judges’ statement of the law in <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> that although the trial judges did
                    not refer to <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, they in effect
                    applied the <em>Barendra</em> test. The trial judges’
                    approach to s 34 was also in line with the approach of the Straits
                    Settlements CCA in <em>Vincent Banka</em> (indeed, that had
                    to be the case because the High Court was bound by decisions of the Straits
                    Settlements CCA). On appeal, Wee CJ made it clear, at [26] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> (quoted at <a href="#p1_135">[135]</a> below), that the trial judges had applied
                    s 34 properly <em>vis-à-vis</em> the charge against
                    Sim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   
        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Mimi and Sim appealed against their convictions for murder. One of the
                    arguments raised by defence counsel before the CCA – which is the most
                    material argument for present purposes – was as follows (see <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is argued [that s 34] can only be applied <em>if
                            the common intention of the persons accused of an offence is to commit
                            the offence with which they are charged</em>. In other words it is
                        argued that [Sim] will not be guilty of the offence under s 302 of the
                        Penal Code unless the common intention of [Mimi and Sim] was to cause the
                        death of [Mrs W], or was <em>such other intention as is
                            mentioned in s 300 of the Penal Code</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    It should be noted that, like the High Court’s statement of the law in
                        <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>, counsel’s
                    submission to the CCA in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> was
                        <em>wholly consistent</em> with the <em>Barendra</em> test, except that counsel referred to the requisite
                    common intention as a common intention to commit the <em>offence</em> which the secondary offender was charged with, as
                    opposed to a common intention to commit the <em>criminal
                        act</em> which gave rise to the offence charged. Counsel’s
                    submission in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> was also in
                    line with the principles laid down by the Straits Settlements CCA in <em>Vincent Banka</em>, where Huggard CJ stated the law as
                    laid down in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, but used the
                    words “act”, “criminal act” and
                    “crime” interchangeably instead of the specific term used in
                    s 34, <em>viz</em>, “criminal act” (see
                        <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Wee CJ responded to counsel’s argument as follows (see <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no doubt that for [s 34] to apply <em>there
                            must be in existence a common intention between all the persons who
                            committed the criminal act</em>, and <em>that a
                            criminal act be done in furtherance of that common intention</em>.
                            <em>When these two requirements are proved, each of such
                            persons would be liable for the entire criminal act in the same manner
                            as if he had done it alone</em> [citing the Privy Council’s
                        decision in <em>Mahbub Shah</em> at 120 (reproduced at
                            <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a> above)]. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Wee CJ then went on to quote (at [24] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em>) the Privy Council’s explanation of the
                    phrase “a criminal act” in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 7–9 (reproduced at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Wee CJ’s statements were interpreted in subsequent cases as a
                    rejection of counsel’s argument on the law (see <a href="#p1_120">[120]</a>–<a href="#p1_121">[121]</a> above),
                    but no explanation has been given for this interpretation. In our view,
                    Wee CJ did not reject counsel’s argument. There is nothing in his
                    comment at [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> to suggest
                    that the principle formulated by counsel was incorrect (even though, as just
                    mentioned, counsel referred to a common intention to commit an offence rather
                    than a common intention to do a criminal act). All that Wee CJ said at [23]
                    of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> was that two requirements
                    must be satisfied before s 34 could apply, namely:</p>

                        persons who committed the criminal act” (see [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>); and</p>

                            Wong (CCA)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    What Wee CJ left unexplained in stating the law in this way was this:
                    what was the common intention in furtherance of which the criminal act was done?
                    He did not provide a connection between the two requirements which he laid down
                    at [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>. He did not
                    explain what the common intention of all the offenders had to be. If Wee CJ
                    had stated that the first requirement at [23] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> was “a common intention between all the
                    persons <em>to commit</em> a criminal act” [emphasis
                    added], it would have provided the necessary connection with the second
                    requirement in that paragraph, and this would in turn have made it clear what
                    the requisite common intention was. In the context of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em>, the common intention found by the trial judges
                    was clear, and the CCA accepted that finding. In our view, the omission by
                    Wee CJ to connect the two requirements set out at [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> led later courts to give a literal
                    interpretation to the second requirement without linking it back to the first
                    requirement, and in turn gave rise to the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test. It led the courts to decide that for the
                    purposes of imposing constructive liability on secondary offenders pursuant to
                    s 34 in a “twin crime” case, it was not necessary for the
                    secondary offenders to have a common intention to do the (collateral) criminal
                    act done by the actual doer which resulted in the offence charged. This meant
                    (for instance) that where A, B and C had a common intention to rob D, and C
                    killed D in the course of the robbery in order to facilitate the robbery or
                    further its accomplishment, s 34 could apply to make A and B constructively
                    liable for the offence resulting from C’s criminal act of killing D, even
                    if A and B did not share C’s intention to kill D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It is clear from the findings of fact of the trial judges in <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>, which were affirmed by the CCA (in
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>), that s 34 was
                    applicable to make Sim constructively liable for the offence resulting from the
                    criminal act committed by Mimi as: (a) he shared a common intention with
                    Mimi to either cause Mrs W’s death or inflict bodily injury on
                    Mrs W with a knife; and (b) the injuries which were in fact inflicted
                    on Mrs W were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,
                        <em>ie</em>, those injuries amounted to
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury. Prof Hor commented
                    in the “Common Intention” article (at p 496) that the
                    evidence in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> would have
                    satisfied the law as set out in <em>Vincent Banka</em> and
                        <em>Chhui Yi</em>. In our view, the actual decision in
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> was based on an
                    application of the <em>Barendra</em> test. Unfortunately,
                    Wee CJ’s failure to explain the connection between the two
                    requirements set out at [23] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> led to a misunderstanding of the actual <em>ratio</em> of that case. We explain below why we are of the
                    view that there was such a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    It is first necessary to point out that Wee CJ’s statements at [23]
                    of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> may not have been original
                    formulations. They bear a striking resemblance to the words (in bold italics in
                    the quotation below) used in two passages in <em>Nazir and others
                        v Emperor</em> (1946) 49 Cr LJ 271 (“<em>Nazir</em>”), a decision of the High Court of
                    Allahabad. In that case, five persons planned to abduct a married woman and beat
                    up her husband, with (so the court stated at [30]) “a remote wish or
                    intention” that the husband should be killed. The abduction was carried
                    out and, in the course of it, the husband was killed. The accused, who drove the
                    abductee away, argued that he could not be liable for the offence of murder as
                    he had not been present at the killing. Apropos this argument, Raghubar
                    Dayal J said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The result essential for the applicability of this section [<em>ie</em>, s 34 IPC] is undoubtedly <b><em>the existence of a common intention between all the
                                several persons who committed the criminal act, and the next
                                essential is that a criminal act be done in furtherance of that
                                common intention</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    
              <em>When these two essentials are satisfied, each of
                                such persons would be liable for the entire criminal act in the same
                                manner as if he alone had done it irrespective of … whether
                                he was present at the time or not</em>. Such view was held by
                            their Lordships of the Privy Council in [<em>Barendra (PC)</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Two points should be noted about the two passages quoted above. First,
                    Dayal J held that what he stated in these two passages represented the view
                    of the Privy Council in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>. As may
                    be recalled, the Privy Council’s view in that case was that the murder of
                    the postmaster was committed in furtherance of the common intention of the
                    robbers to rob the postmaster and, if necessary, to shoot him to kill. The
                    intention to kill was part of the robbers’ common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Second, although Dayal J did not specify that “<em>that</em> common intention” [emphasis added] (see [25] of
                        <em>Nazir</em>) must be the common intention to commit
                    the criminal act done by the actual doer which gave rise to the offence charged
                    against the secondary offenders, he subsequently (in effect) said so at [28]
                    when he described the relevant criminal act in that case as “the entire
                    transaction composed of the abduction and the beating <em>which
                        proceeded from the common intention of all</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. The charge in <em>Nazir</em> was for the offence of
                    murder resulting from the assault on the husband by the actual doer. In our
                    view, [28] of <em>Nazir</em> is merely an elaboration of
                    [25]–[26] thereof. If [25]–[26] of <em>Nazir</em> are read without reference to [28] thereof (or without
                    reference to what the Privy Council decided in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>), they are liable to be misunderstood to mean
                    that for the secondary offenders in <em>Nazir</em> to be
                    held constructively liable under s 34 IPC for murder, it was not necessary
                    for them to have a common intention to beat up the woman’s husband;
                    instead, it was sufficient so long as the beating was done in furtherance of
                    their common intention to abduct the woman. In our view, this was precisely how
                    the two requirements set out by Wee CJ at [23] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> were misunderstood. It appears to us that this
                    misunderstanding occurred because Wee CJ omitted, at [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>, to specify the common intention in
                    furtherance of which the criminal act was done. In our view, this
                    misunderstanding led to the rise of the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test, which, it is clear, is not supported by a
                    proper understanding of what Wee CJ had intended to say at [23] of
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>, Wee CJ, after
                    commenting on defence counsel’s submission, proceeded to elaborate on the
                    relevance of the <em>mens rea</em> for the offence
                    committed by the actual doer in these words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    It is clear from the Privy Council’s interpretation [in
                                <em>Barendra (PC)</em>] of the words
                            “criminal act” that <em>it is the result of
                                a criminal act which is a criminal offence</em>. It then
                            remains, in any particular case, to find out the actual offence
                            constituted by the “criminal act”. If the nature of the
                            offence depends on a particular intention the intention of the actual
                            doer of the criminal act has to be considered. <em>What
                                this intention is will decide the offence committed by him and then
                                s 34 applies to make the others vicariously or collectively
                                liable for the same offence</em>. The intention that is an
                            ingredient of the offence constituted by the criminal act is the
                            intention of the actual doer and must be distinguished from the common
                            intention of the [actual] doer and his confederates. It [<em>ie</em>, the intention of the actual doer] may be
                            identical with the common intention or it may not. Where it is not
                            identical with the common intention, it must nevertheless be consistent
                            with the carrying out of the common intention, otherwise the criminal
                            act done by the actual doer would not be in furtherance of the common
                            intention. Thus if A and B form a common intention to cause injury to C
                            with a knife and A holds C while B stabs C deliberately in the region of
                            the heart and the stab wound is sufficient in the ordinary course of
                            nature to cause death, B is clearly guilty of murder. Applying s 34
                            it is also clear that B’s act in stabbing C is in furtherance of
                            the common intention to cause injury to C with a knife because B’s
                            act is clearly consistent with the carrying out of that common
                            intention[,] and as their [<em>ie</em>, A and
                            B’s] “criminal act”, <em>ie</em> that unity of criminal behaviour, resulted in the
                            criminal offence of murder punishable under s 302, A is also guilty
                            of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    
              <em>On the facts of the present case, we are
                                accordingly of the opinion that s 34 has been properly applied
                                with regard to the charge against [Sim]</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    It can be seen from the above quotation of [26] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> that Wee CJ held that the trial judges had
                    properly applied the law on s 34, <em>ie</em>, the law
                    encapsulated in the <em>Barendra</em> test. In the light of
                    this, we can now analyse Wee CJ’s statements at [25] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> against the backdrop of
                    Wee CJ’s upholding of the trial judges’ application of the
                        <em>Barendra</em> test in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em>. What Wee CJ said in the first half of [25]
                    of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> was, in essence, as
                    follows: (a) where the nature of the offence arising from the criminal act
                    done by the actual doer depended on the intention with which that criminal act
                    was done, the intention of the actual doer in doing that criminal act would
                    determine the offence committed by him; and (b) s 34 would then apply
                    to make the secondary offenders constructively liable for the same offence. In
                        <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>, Mimi intentionally
                    stabbed Mrs W at the vital parts and caused her death. Mimi did the
                    criminal act described in s 300(<em>c</em>) of the
                    Penal Code with the necessary <em>mens rea</em>.
                    Mimi’s <em>mens rea</em> determined the offence
                    committed by her, and, because there was a common intention between Mimi and Sim
                    to either cause Mrs W’s death or inflict bodily injury on Mrs W
                    with a knife, Mimi’s criminal act was done in furtherance of that common
                    intention. Hence, in the context of the evidence in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em>, s 34 was incontrovertibly applicable to make
                    Sim constructively liable for the s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    murder arising from Mimi’s criminal act, consistent with the <em>Barendra</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Next, Wee CJ said that the intention of the actual doer in committing the
                    criminal act done which resulted in the offence charged had to be distinguished
                    from the common intention of all the offenders (<em>ie</em>, the actual doer <em>plus</em> the secondary
                    offenders). They might be identical, but, if they were not identical (<em>eg</em>, an intention on the actual doer’s part to kill
                    and a common intention among all the offenders to cause hurt), the actual
                    doer’s intention must at least be consistent with the common intention of
                    all the offenders (<em>eg</em>, an intention on the actual
                    doer’s part to kill and a common intention among all the offenders to stab
                    or shoot vital areas of the victim’s body) because, if that were not the
                    case, the criminal act done by the actual doer would not be in furtherance of
                    all the offenders’ common intention. In <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em>, there was no need to consider the distinction
                    between Mimi’s intention in stabbing Mrs W and the common intention
                    of Mimi and Sim to either cause Mrs W’s death or inflict on
                    Mrs W bodily injury with a knife because Mimi’s intention was clearly
                    consistent with Mimi and Sim’s common intention, and the stabbing of
                    Mrs W by Mimi was also done in furtherance of that common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Consider, however, the case where the common intention of A and B is
                    characterised as, specifically, a common intention to disfigure C’s face
                    with a sharp instrument: if A, in a fit of jealousy or rage, stabs C with a
                    knife and kills C, it cannot reasonably be said that A’s criminal act in
                    stabbing C is consistent with A and B’s common intention to disfigure C.
                    In contrast, if we characterise A and B’s common intention more broadly as
                    a common intention to cause injury to C without setting any limitation on the
                    type of injury which might be inflicted on C, then A’s act of stabbing C
                        <em>fatally</em> can be said to be consistent with the
                    common intention to cause injury to C. Consistency is, therefore, not a fixed
                    concept – it depends on the level of abstraction adopted in defining the
                    common intention that is alleged to be furthered by the criminal act done. We
                    must thus be careful in applying the concept of consistency (which was described
                    by Prof Hor as “an unhappily ambiguous term in the context of the
                    need for certainty in the criminal law” (see p 497 of the
                    “Common Intention” article)) in the context of s 34 to impute
                    constructive liability for joint offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>, Wee CJ provided an
                    illustration of consistency at a general level of abstraction, with the result
                    that the criminal act done by the actual doer in that illustration was
                    consistent with the common intention in question, even though that same criminal
                    act might be inconsistent with the common intention if the latter were defined
                    at a more specific level of abstraction. His illustration was as follows (see
                    [25] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f A and B form a common intention to cause injury to C with a knife and
                        A holds C while B stabs C deliberately in the region of the heart and the
                        stab wound is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, B
                        is clearly guilty of [s 300(<em>c</em>)] murder.
                            <em>Applying s 34</em> it is also clear that
                        B’s act in stabbing C is in furtherance of the common intention to
                        cause injury to C with a knife because B’s act is clearly consistent
                        with the carrying out of that common intention and as their [<em>ie</em>, A and B’s] “criminal act”,
                            <em>ie</em> that unity of criminal behaviour,
                        resulted in the criminal offence of murder punishable under s 302, A is
                        also guilty of murder. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The above passage actually deals with two separate issues (namely,
                    (a) consistency of B’s criminal act with A and B’s common
                    intention; and (b) the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder), but Wee CJ dealt only with the former
                        (<em>ie</em>, the consistency issue). He said that
                    B’s act of stabbing C in the region of the heart was consistent with A and
                    B’s common intention to cause injury to C with a knife. That statement, in
                    our view, is obvious, given that A and B’s common intention was defined
                    very broadly as a common intention to injure C with a knife, without any
                    limitation on the type of injury that might be inflicted on C. From this
                    perspective, B’s act of stabbing C in the region of the heart could be
                    said to be consistent with A and B’s common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    If, however, A and B’s common intention in Wee CJ’s
                    illustration had been defined more narrowly as a common intention to disfigure
                    C’s face (<em>ie</em>, as a common intention to
                    commit a specific criminal act), it would be difficult to see how B’s act
                    of stabbing C in the region of the heart could be said to be consistent with A
                    and B’s common intention. Section 34 should then <em>not</em> apply to make A constructively liable for the offence
                    resulting from B’s criminal act (<em>viz</em>, the
                    offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder) because the type
                    of injury which A and B commonly intended to cause to C (<em>viz</em>, disfigurement of the face) was not 300(<em>c</em>) injury (s 300(<em>c</em>) injury
                    being the type of injury which B in fact caused to C). A second objection to
                    making A constructively liable for the offence resulting from B’s criminal
                    act if A and B’s common intention in Wee CJ’s illustration had
                    been defined in the specific manner just stated (<em>ie</em>, as a common intention to disfigure C’s <em>face</em>) is that it would be difficult to assert that
                    B’s act of stabbing C <em>in the region of the
                        heart</em> is consistent with or in furtherance of that common
                    intention. Therefore, regardless of whether or not the illustration of
                    consistency given by Wee CJ at [25] of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> is considered in the light of the factual matrix
                    of that case (where there was a common intention to either cause death or
                    inflict bodily injury with a knife), that illustration of consistency must be
                    understood as being based on the adoption of a particular level of abstraction
                    in applying s 34 to the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder. In our view, the illustration given by Wee CJ
                    does not support the conclusion that in the present case, the mere fact that
                    Bala’s criminal act (<em>viz</em>, the assault on
                    Wan) facilitated the robbery meant that that criminal act was in furtherance of
                    the Appellants’ common intention to rob Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    It is instructive to compare Wee CJ’s illustration with the
                    scenario that was before the Supreme Court of India in <em>Bhaba
                        Nanda Sarma and others v The State of Assam</em> AIR 1977
                    SC 2252 (“<em>Bhaba Nanda Sarma</em>”).
                    The accused in that case (“BNS”) participated in an assault along
                    with two companions by holding the victim, while his two companions inflicted on
                    the victim bodily injuries from which he died. All three men were subsequently
                    charged with murder committed in furtherance of a common intention. At first
                    instance, the trial judge acquitted all three men. His decision was reversed by
                    the High Court of Gauhati, which convicted all three men of murder committed in
                    furtherance of a common intention. On further appeal, the Supreme Court of India
                    held, on the evidence, that BNS had shared only the common intention of his two
                    companions to commit “a lesser offence than murder” (at [6]), and
                    not their common intention to murder the victim. The court thus set aside
                    BNS’s conviction for murder and replaced it with a conviction for culpable
                    homicide not amounting to murder under s 304 read with s 34 of the IPC
                    (in contrast, the murder convictions of BNS’s two companions were upheld).
                    Untwalia J emphasised (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To attract the application of S. 34 it must be established beyond any
                        shadow of doubt that the criminal act was done by several persons in
                        furtherance of the common intention of all. <em>In other
                            words, the prosecution must prove facts to justify an inference that all
                            the participants of the act had shared a common intention to commit the
                            criminal act which was finally committed by one or more of the
                            participants</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The analysis above explains and supports our view that there is no basis to
                    suggest that the CCA in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> had
                    intended to overthrow <em>Vincent Banka</em>, which would
                    have meant rejecting the <em>Barendra</em> test. We see
                    nothing in the judgment of Wee CJ in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em>, properly understood, to indicate that he was
                    enunciating a new test that departed (or was intended to depart) from the
                        <em>Barendra</em> test. In our view, the <em>Barendra</em> test sets out the correct position on the
                    common intention element of s 34. In <em>Mahbub
                        Shah</em>, the Privy Council interpreted s 34 IPC in the same way
                    as the provision was interpreted in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> (see <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a> above), and the same position was taken locally (<em>vis-à-vis</em> s 34) in <em>Vincent
                        Banka</em> and <em>Chhui Yi</em> and,
                    subsequently, <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>. The <em>Barendra</em> test, in our view, is in line with the purpose
                    for which s 34 IPC (and s 1 of the 1870 IPC Amendment Act) was
                    enacted; this applies <em>mutatis mutandis</em> in respect
                    of s 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Application of the <em>Barendra</em>
                test to s 300(<em>c</em>) murder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    One other important aspect of <em>Mimi
                        Wong (HC)</em> and <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> ought to be addressed – namely, the
                        <em>application</em> of the <em>Barendra</em> test to, specifically, the offence of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder. It is necessary for us
                    to express our views on this matter as s 300(<em>c</em>) murder is the offence which group offenders are most commonly
                    prosecuted for in Singapore. As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_125">[125]</a> and <a href="#p1_135">[135]</a>–<a href="#p1_136">[136]</a> above),
                    Wee CJ said in <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> that the
                    trial judges in <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> had applied
                    s 34 properly, <em>ie</em>, they had proceeded,
                    correctly, on the basis that s 34 would apply to Sim if there was
                    “[a] <em>common intention of causing bodily
                        injury</em> to [Mrs W] and [if] the bodily injury intended to be
                    inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death”
                    [emphasis added] (see <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> at 59).
                    On this basis, it may be argued that if A and B have a common intention to punch
                    C, and A delivers punches in the region of C’s vital organs, resulting in
                    C sustaining s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, A’s fatal
                    punches can be considered to be in furtherance of A and B’s common
                    intention, and B can be made constructively liable as a secondary offender for
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    This would not be an unreasonable approach, having regard to the established
                    law (<em>ie</em>, the law laid down in <em>Virsa Singh</em> (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    above)) on how s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code
                    should be applied with respect to the <em>actual doer</em>.
                    Where the <em>secondary offender</em> is concerned,
                    however, we are of the view that he should not be made constructively liable for
                    the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder arising from
                    the actual doer’s criminal act unless there is a common intention to
                    cause, specifically, s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, and not
                    any other type of injury (in this regard, see our observations at <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>–<a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> above on why our courts should not, where constructive
                    liability under s 34 for s 300(<em>c</em>) murder
                    is concerned, apply the <em>Virsa Singh</em> test and hold
                    that a common intention to inflict any type of injury is sufficient for a
                    secondary offender to be found guilty of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder). In our view, causing death or killing (whether by
                    way of inflicting s 300(<em>c</em>) injury or
                    otherwise) can be said to be <em>inconsistent</em> with or,
                    at least, in <em>excess</em> of a common intention to cause
                    hurt, whether simple hurt or grievous hurt. Interestingly, even under the
                    English doctrine of common purpose, the position is that (<em>per</em> Toulson LJ in <em>Mendez</em> at
                    [47]; see also <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would not be just that D [<em>ie</em>, the
                        secondary offender] should be found guilty of the murder of V [<em>ie</em>, the victim] by P [<em>ie</em>, the actual doer], if P’s act was of a different
                        kind from, and much more dangerous than, the sort of acts which D intended
                        or foresaw as part of the joint enterprise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Of course, if the common intention is to cause s 300(<em>c</em>) injury generally without any particular kind of injury
                    specified, then the inflicting of any fatal injury with any kind of weapon or
                    object would be in furtherance of that common intention. In the context of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, a common intention to
                    cause such injury is substantially the same as a common intention to cause death
                    by the infliction of the specific injury which was in fact caused to the victim
                    since s 300(<em>c</em>) injury is, by definition,
                    injury that is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Thus,
                    if A, B and C have a common intention to give D a good beating, but C causes
                    D’s death in the course of beating him, it does not necessarily follow
                    that A and B are constructively liable for the offence resulting from C’s
                    criminal act as there is no common intention to inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on D. Similarly, if A, B and C have a common
                    intention to disfigure D’s face, and C, in the course of carrying out this
                    common intention, stabs D in the heart and kills him, A and B cannot be held
                    constructively liable pursuant to s 34 for the killing done by C as injury
                    caused to a person by disfiguring his face is not s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In this connection, it should also be noted that in <em>Mohamed
                        Yasin</em>, the Privy Council held (at [9]) that it must be proved
                        “<em>as a matter of scientific fact</em>”
                    [emphasis added] that the injury inflicted on the victim amounted to
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) injury. Applying this
                    requirement (which may be satisfied by scientific evidence, including medical or
                    forensic evidence) to that part of the Prosecution’s case against Daniel
                    and Christopher which is premised on the contention that the Appellants had a
                    common intention to beat Wan on the head to render him unconscious (a contention
                    which the Judge did not find to be supported on the facts), an issue would arise
                    as to whether the injury caused to a person by beating him on his head can be
                    regarded as s 300(<em>c</em>) injury if no scientific
                    evidence (which would necessarily include medical evidence) is called (as
                    counsel for Daniel pointed out (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>
                    above)) to show <em>as a scientific fact</em> that
                        <em>any knock on the head with a weapon akin to the baseball
                        bat</em> is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                    death. Thus, even if the Judge had found on the evidence that the Appellants had
                    a common intention to beat Wan on the head to render him unconscious, it would
                    not necessarily follow that this common intention was a common intention to
                    inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on Wan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In the present case, the Judge found that Bala’s assault on Wan with the
                    baseball bat gave rise to the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder because Bala <em>intentionally</em> inflicted on Wan s 300(<em>c</em>) injury. This is a correct application of <em>Virsa Singh</em> as far as Bala’s (direct) liability for
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder is concerned. However,
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Daniel and Christopher’s
                    constructive liability for s 300(<em>c</em>) murder,
                    the Judge did not find that the Appellants had a common intention to beat Wan up
                    or to beat him on the head (let alone a common intention to beat him on the head
                    with, specifically, the baseball bat). The Judge merely found that Daniel and
                    Christopher were aware that violence would be used to overpower Wan in order to
                    facilitate the robbery (see the GD at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>).
                    In view of these findings, s 34 was not applicable to render Daniel and
                    Christopher constructively liable for the s 300(<em>c</em>) murder resulting from Bala’s assault on Wan as the
                    Appellants had no common intention to inflict the specific injuries which Bala
                    actually inflicted on Wan.</p>

                        Chye (HC)</em>”). In that case, the proprietor of a wine
                    bar (“Chew”) was killed in a robbery. The trial judges found that
                    the first accused (“NBC”) and the second accused
                    (“LKH”) had a common intention to rob Chew and to shoot him if he
                    resisted. NBC brought with him a gun for that purpose. Before entering the wine
                    shop, he loaded the gun and handed it to LKH. Chew resisted and LKH shot him
                    dead. The defence was that Chew was shot accidentally in the struggle. The trial
                    judges rejected this defence and convicted NBC and LKH of murder. On appeal, the
                    CCA held that the trial judges were entitled on the evidence to conclude that
                    NBC and LKH had <em>a common intention to rob as well
                        as</em> “<em>to use the gun if any resistance
                        was put up by [Chew] during the course of the robbery</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see <em>Neoh Bean Chye (CCA)</em> at
                    [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In <em>Neoh Bean Chye (HC)</em>, the High Court
                        (<em>per</em> Choor Singh J) reiterated
                    Wee CJ’s statement at [23] in <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> that for s 34 to apply (see <em>Neoh Bean Chye (HC)</em> at [50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is sufficient if the Prosecution prove[s] that there was in existence
                        a common intention between all the persons who committed the criminal act
                        and that the act which constituted the offence charged was done in
                        furtherance of the common intention. This is clear from the decisions of the
                        Privy Council in [<em>Barendra (PC)</em>] and
                            <em>Mahbub Shah</em> … and also from the
                        recent decision of the [CCA] in [<em>Mimi
                            Wong (CCA)</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Choor Singh J also commented that “the headnote of the
                    report of the decision in …
                    <em>Vincent Banka</em> [did] not contain a correct
                    statement of the law” (see <em>Neoh Bean
                        Chye (HC)</em> at [50]), this was not material to the High
                    Court’s eventual decision as all that Choor Singh J meant to say was,
                    in effect, that the <em>Barendra</em> test should be stated
                    not in terms of a common intention to commit a crime, but, rather, in terms of a
                    common intention to commit a criminal act. In this regard, we note that the
                    essential facts found by the High Court in <em>Neoh Bean
                        Chye (HC)</em> and affirmed by the CCA in <em>Neoh
                        Bean Chye (CCA)</em> are similar to those in <em>Barendra (PC)</em>. On the facts found by the High Court (which,
                    as just mentioned, were affirmed by the CCA), it would appear that the CCA
                    applied the <em>Barendra</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    After <em>Neoh Bean Chye (HC)</em> and <em>Neoh Bean Chye (CCA)</em>, <em>Vincent
                        Banka</em> and its progeny ceased to be cited as precedents on
                    s 34 for more than 20 years until 1999, when (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above) the CA observed in <em>Shaiful Edham</em> at [52] that they represented the wrong line of
                    the “two divergent lines of authority” on s 34. As we have
                    demonstrated, this observation is inaccurate as it overlooked the fact that
                        post-<em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> decisions
                    misunderstood what <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> had
                    actually decided and what Wee CJ had said in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    We do not propose to provide a detailed analysis of all the reported
                        post-<em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> local cases on
                    s 34, when invoked in relation to the offence of murder, to determine
                    whether or not their outcomes would have been the same if the court in those
                    cases (whether a trial court or an appellate court) had applied the <em>Barendra</em> test. We conclude from our examination of those
                    cases that in a significant number of them, the court specifically made a
                    finding that there was a common intention to kill or to cause death (in cases
                    where the secondary offender was found guilty of murder (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Mohamed Bachu Miah and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 783 and <em>Maniam s/o Rathinswamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994]
                    2 SLR(R) 264)), or, conversely, that there was no such common
                    intention (in cases where the secondary offender was acquitted of murder (see,
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Mazlan bin Maidun &amp; Anor</em> [1992] SGHC 134 and
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v L Hassan &amp; 2 Ors</em>
                    [1998] SGHC 357)). There are also cases where the court found that
                    there was a common intention to cause grievous hurt or injury that was found to
                    be s 300(<em>c</em>) injury (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Ramu Annadavascan and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 21, <em>Suradet Senarit and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993]
                    2 SLR(R) 754, <em>Asokan v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 1 SLR(R) 936 and <em>Mansoor s/o Abdullah and
                        another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 403). In
                    respect of all these cases, it can be said that there was evidence on which, if
                    the <em>Barendra</em> test had been applied, it would have
                    been possible for the court to find that there existed a common intention to
                    commit one of the criminal acts described in s 300 of the Penal Code as
                    constituting the offence of murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    There are, of course, also cases where the court appeared to have relied on
                    the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test to convict
                    the secondary offender of murder arising from the criminal act done by the
                    actual doer, even though the secondary offender <em>did
                        not</em> participate in that criminal act, on the basis that that
                    criminal act had been done by the actual doer in furtherance of all the
                    offenders’ common intention. These cases have given rise to the impression
                    that the courts have adopted an inconsistent approach in applying s 34, an
                    issue which has often been the subject of academic comments. In our view, a
                    close examination of the facts of the cases where the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test was apparently applied
                    (especially the findings of the trial court), would show that in most of them,
                    the criminal act done by the actual doer could conceivably be said to have been
                    done in furtherance of a common intention to commit any one of the four criminal
                    acts described in s 300 of the Penal Code as giving rise to the offence of
                    murder – in other words, the <em>Barendra</em> test
                    would have been satisfied in those cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    We propose to examine only two of the cases where the <em>Barendra</em> test, although not applied by this court, would or
                    might have been satisfied if one were to look closely at the facts of the case.
                    These cases are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Public Prosecutor v Ibrahim bin Masod &amp;
                            Anor</em> [1993] SGHC 172 (“<em>Ibrahim (HC)</em>”), which was upheld on appeal in
                            <em>Ibrahim bin Masod and another v Public
                            Prosecutor</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 438 (“<em>Ibrahim (CA)</em>”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye and another</em>
                        [2005] 2 SLR(R) 130 (“<em>Lim Poh
                            Lye (HC)</em>”), which was reversed in <em>Lim Poh Lye (CA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In <em>Ibrahim (HC)</em>, the two accused
                    (“Ibrahim” and “Liow”) kidnapped the deceased and
                    demanded a ransom, which was not paid. Subsequently, the deceased was strangled
                    to death in the flat where he was being held when Ibrahim left the flat to sell
                    a Rolex watch belonging to the deceased. The trial judge found that there was a
                    pre-arranged plan between Ibrahim and Liow to kidnap the deceased for ransom,
                    and that the killing had been done in furtherance of the common intention. Both
                    accused were convicted of murder, and both appealed against their convictions
                    (Liow, however, died before the appeal was heard). The CA upheld Ibrahim’s
                    conviction, holding that there had been a common intention on the part of
                    Ibrahim and Liow “to kidnap [the deceased] for ransom in the furtherance
                    of which Liow wilfully and deliberately strangled [the deceased] to
                    death” (see <em>Ibrahim (CA)</em> at [44]).
                    Although the CA appeared to have applied the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test, the CA also stated that, on the evidence,
                    “the inference that … [there] was … a pre-arranged plan to
                    kidnap [the deceased] for ransom and <em>to do away with
                        him</em> [was] irresistible” [emphasis added] (at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>). In other words, the CA in effect found that
                    there was evidence of a common intention to kill the deceased, even though the
                    High Court did not make such an explicit finding of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In <em>Lim Poh Lye (HC)</em>, the deceased
                    (“Bock”) was stabbed in the legs by the first accused
                    (“Lim”) and/or another man (“NKS”) whilst being
                    robbed by Lim, NKS and the second accused (“Koh”). (The evidence
                    was unclear as to whether it was Lim or NKS who had inflicted the fatal stab
                    wound.) One of the stab wounds severed the femoral vein in Bock’s right
                    leg and caused Bock to bleed to death. Lim and Koh were subsequently charged
                    with murder under s 302 of the Penal Code read with s 34 (NKS was not
                    charged as he fled the country). The trial judge acquitted Lim and Koh of
                    murder, and convicted them instead of the offence under s 394 of the Penal
                    Code of voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery on the ground that
                    “there was no common intention to kill, and … the gang did not
                    have the common intention to use the knives [which they had brought with them]
                    for injuring Bock, but merely to frighten him” (see <em>Lim Poh Lye (HC)</em> at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    On appeal by the Prosecution, the CA allowed the appeal and convicted both Lim
                    and Koh of murder on the ground (applying the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test) that Bock had been killed in furtherance of
                    the common intention to rob. However, the CA appeared to have had, at the back
                    of its mind, the belief that the robbers had meant to use the knives which they
                    had with them to cause some form of injury to Bock. This can be seen from [60]
                    of <em>Lim Poh Lye (CA)</em>, where the CA
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>While it may well be that the knives were brought to
                            frighten Bock, it must have been within the contemplation of the
                            trio</em> [<em>ie</em>, Lim, Koh and NKS]
                            <em>to use them if Bock should turn out to be difficult
                            which was, in fact, the case</em>. In any event, we do not see how
                        it could be seriously argued that using the knife to inflict physical
                        injury, either by Lim or [NKS], would not be in furtherance of the common
                        intention to rob. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    A common intention to commit the criminal act done by the actual doer which
                    gives rise to the offence charged, even if it is a contingent or dormant
                    intention (see <em>Ibra Akanda</em> at 363 (reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_105">[105]</a> above)) or “a remote wish
                    or intention” (see <em>Nazir</em> at [30] (referred
                    to at <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a> above)), is sufficient to
                    render s 34 applicable to secondary offenders, even if they do not
                    participate in the criminal act done by the actual doer which results in the
                    offence charged (in this regard, see further <a href="#p1_162">[162]</a>–<a href="#p1_163">[163]</a> below).
                    From this perspective, although the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test was applied by the CA in <em>Lim Poh Lye (CA)</em> to reverse the trial judge’s
                    acquittal of Lim and Koh on the facts, it appears to us that on the CA’s
                    view of the evidence, the <em>Barendra</em> test could have
                    been satisfied. This was because the CA was of the view that there was
                    sufficient material for a court to find that there was a common intention on the
                    part of Lim and Koh to rob, as well as a dormant common intention to use the
                    knives which they had brought with them to stop Bock from being
                    “difficult” (see <em>Lim Poh
                        Lye (CA)</em> at [60]), if necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The participation element</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    We now turn to examine the third key element of s 34, <em>viz</em>, the participation element.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    In <em>Lee Chez Kee (CA)</em>, this court stated (at
                    sub-para (b) of [253]) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    participation element of s 34:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a “twin crime” situation, there is no need for
                        participation in the collateral criminal act as well as the primary criminal
                        act; participation in the primary criminal act would be sufficient for
                        liability to fix on all subsequent secondary offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is essentially no departure from this position if the <em>Barendra</em> test is applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    In <em>Barendra (PC)</em>, it could be said that BKG
                    satisfied the participation element (for the purposes of being held
                    constructively liable for the offence of murder) based on one of two alternative
                    grounds – namely, either (a) on the ground that he had participated
                    in the shooting of the postmaster (the shooting being the <em>specific</em> criminal act, out of the “unity of criminal
                    behaviour” (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 9)
                    engaged in by the robbers, that gave rise to the offence of murder); or
                    (b) on the ground that although he had not participated in the shooting, he
                    had participated in the robbery, which was part of the overall plan of the
                    robbers to rob the postmaster and, if necessary, to shoot him to kill. In other
                    words, it was not necessary for BKG to have participated in the <em>specific</em> criminal act done which resulted in the offence
                    that he was charged with (<em>viz</em>, the criminal act of
                    shooting the postmaster). Instead, all that was required was participation by
                    BKG in any of the separate acts which collectively made up the “unity of
                    criminal behaviour” (see <em>Barendra (PC)</em>
                    at 9) engaged in by the robbers pursuant to their common intention to rob the
                    postmaster and, if necessary, to shoot him to kill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    
          <em>Barendra (PC)</em> therefore indicates that a
                    secondary offender satisfies the participation requirement if: (a) he
                    participates in the specific criminal act committed by the actual doer which
                    gives rise to the offence charged; or (b) he participates in some other
                    criminal act that is done in furtherance of the common intention of all the
                    offenders (<em>ie</em>, if he participates in any of the
                    diverse acts which together form the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in
                    the offence charged, that unity of criminal behaviour being commonly intended by
                    all the offenders).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of s 34 in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    In the present case, there was no doubt that the Appellants had a common
                    intention to rob Wan, and all of them participated in the acts constituting the
                    robbery in furtherance of that common intention (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above). However, the Judge did not find that the Appellants
                    also had a common intention to inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury or any other specific injury on Wan, although he did
                    find that all three of them knew that violence would be necessary to facilitate
                    the commission of the robbery. In short, there was no finding of a common
                    intention among the Appellants to cause Wan’s death or inflict any
                    specific injury on Wan; the evidence before the court was also, in our view,
                    insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of such a common
                    intention. Thus, s 34 had no application to Daniel and Christopher based on
                    our analysis at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>–<a href="#p1_163">[163]</a> above and, therefore, they could not be
                    held constructively liable for the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder arising from the criminal act committed by Bala under
                    the <em>Barendra</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Restatement of the law on constructive liability under
                s 34</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The analysis at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>–<a href="#p1_163">[163]</a> above sets out what, in our view, is the
                    correct interpretation of the law on the imposition of constructive liability
                    pursuant to s 34. In our view, the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test is a wrong formulation of the law applied in
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA) –</em> the law applied
                    in that case was the <em>Barendra</em> test, which was also
                    applied in <em>Vincent Banka</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The <em>Barendra</em> test, in our view, reflects
                    correctly the true legislative purpose of s 34, which, in the words of
                    Lord Sumner in <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 9
                        (<em>vis-à-vis</em> s 34 IPC), is “to
                    punish participants by making one man answerable for what another does, provided
                    what is done is done in furtherance of a common intention”. A criminal
                    act is done in furtherance of a common intention only if it furthers that common
                    intention, which must be an intention to do something or to achieve a purpose.
                    The crucial question in every case where s 34 is invoked is to identify the
                    relevant common intention. A criminal act which is not commonly intended by all
                    the offenders is inconsistent with or, at least, outside the scope of the
                    offenders’ common intention, and cannot be regarded as having been done in
                    furtherance of that common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    It must be remembered that a charge of murder founded on s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code <em>read with
                        s 34</em> (<em>ie</em>, a charge against a
                        <em>secondary</em> offender) is not the same as a
                    charge against the actual doer (<em>ie</em>, the <em>primary</em> offender), which would be <em>based on s 300(</em>c<em>) alone</em>. In
                    the latter case, it is not necessary to consider whether the actual doer
                    intended to cause the victim s 300(<em>c</em>) injury;
                    instead, it is only necessary to consider whether the actual doer subjectively
                    intended to inflict the injury which was in fact inflicted on the victim and, if
                    so, whether that injury was, on an objective assessment, sufficiently serious to
                    amount to s 300(<em>c</em>) injury. In contrast, in
                    the former case (<em>ie</em>, where a secondary offender is
                    charged with murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) read with
                    s 34), because of the express words “in furtherance of the common
                    intention of all” in s 34, it is necessary to consider whether there
                    was a common intention among all the offenders to inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on the victim (the inflicting of such injury
                    being the criminal act which gives rise to the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder). This is a critical distinction to bear in
                    mind. In this regard, we note that although the trial judges in <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> described one of the common
                    intentions of Mimi and Sim as the “common intention … of
                    inflicting bodily injury on [Mrs W] with a knife” (see 70 of
                        <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em>), the common intention in
                    that case was, on the facts, very specific. It was the common intention to
                    inflict bodily injury on Mrs W <em>with a knife</em>,
                    and the knife injuries in fact inflicted on Mrs W were sufficient in the
                    ordinary course of nature to cause death. In other words, the common intention
                    in <em>Mimi Wong (HC)</em> could easily have been
                    taken to be a common intention to inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    We set out below a non-exhaustive list of various scenarios in which s 34
                    would apply (these are cases in which the requirements of the <em>Barendra</em> test would be met) as well as various scenarios in
                    which it would not apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_a"></a>(a)     A, B and C have a common intention to kill D or cause his death, and all
                        three of them participate in the criminal act resulting in D’s death.
                        Section 34 would apply to make A, B and C liable for the resultant
                        offence as the criminal act done by them would have been done in furtherance
                        of their common intention to kill or cause the death of D. In such a case,
                        because A, B and C all participated in the criminal act giving rise to the
                        offence charged, it is not necessary to determine which of them actually
                        caused the death of D or had the means to cause his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_b"></a>(b)     A, B and C have a common intention to cause D s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, and all three of them participate in
                        inflicting such injury on D. If D dies from that injury, s 34 would
                        apply to make A, B and C liable for the resultant offence (<em>viz</em>, the offence of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder) as the criminal act done by them would have been
                        done in furtherance of the common intention to inflict s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on D. Similarly, in such a case, since A,
                        B and C all participated in the criminal act giving rise to the offence
                        charged, it is not necessary to determine who actually caused the death of D
                        or had the means to cause his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_c"></a>(c)     A, B and C have a common intention to inflict on D a minor injury which is
                        not likely to cause his death (<em>eg</em>, a common
                        intention to disfigure D’s face). If C inflicts on D
                            s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, s 34 would
                            <em>not</em> apply to make A and B constructively
                        liable for the offence resulting from C’s criminal act, <em>provided</em> they do not participate in that act (see
                        also the analogous scenario at sub-para (e) below). This is because
                        C’s criminal act would not be consistent with the common intention of
                        A, B and C, and would instead be (at the very least) outside the scope of
                        that common intention. If, however, A and B participate in C’s act of
                        inflicting on D s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, an
                        inference may be drawn that A, B and C’s common intention changed on
                        the spot into a common intention to do the criminal act actually done by C
                            (<em>ie</em>, a common intention to cause
                            s 300(<em>c</em>) injury to D); s 34
                        would then apply to make A and B constructively liable for the offence
                        resulting from that criminal act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_d"></a>(d)     A, B and C have a common intention to rob D and to kill him or cause his
                        death, if necessary, in order to facilitate or accomplish the robbery. If D
                        is killed by A in the course of the robbery, s 34 would apply to make B
                        and C constructively liable for the offence resulting from A’s
                        criminal act (which would have been done in furtherance of the common
                        intention of A, B and C), provided B and C participated in any of the
                        diverse acts that collectively constituted the criminal act done in
                        furtherance of the common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_e"></a>(e)     A, B and C have a common intention to rob D, but not to cause any physical
                        harm to him. A, however, kills D to facilitate or accomplish the robbery.
                            <em>Provided</em> B and C do not participate in
                        A’s criminal act, s 34 would <em>not</em>
                        apply to make them constructively liable for the offence resulting from that
                        criminal act as that criminal act would not have been done in furtherance of
                        the common intention of A, B and C. Although A’s criminal act furthers
                        the robbery, it does not further A, B and C’s common intention in
                        respect of the robbery (which is to rob D, but not to harm him physically);
                        A’s criminal act would in fact be <em>inconsistent</em> with or, at least, outside the scope of that
                        common intention (see also our observations at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above on
                            <em>Mohamed Yasin</em>). If, however, B and C
                        participate in A’s act of killing D, an inference may be made that A,
                        B and C’s common intention changed on the spot into a common intention
                        to do the criminal act actually done by A (<em>ie</em>,
                        a common intention to kill D); s 34 would then apply to make B and C
                        constructively liable for the offence resulting from that criminal act (see
                        also sub-para (c) above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_f"></a>(f)     It should also be noted that in the scenario described in
                        sub-para (e) above, if B and C have subjective knowledge that A might
                        likely kill D in the course of the robbery and, despite such knowledge, go
                        ahead to participate in the plan to rob D, and A does indeed kill D while
                        carrying out the robbery, it may be possible for the court to infer, in an
                        appropriate case, that B and C, by acquiescing in the likelihood of A
                        committing the criminal act actually done (<em>ie</em>,
                        the killing of D), themselves shared A’s intention to commit that
                        criminal act (see <em>Nga Aung Thein</em> at 92 and
                            <em>Gorachand Gope</em> at 456–457 (both
                        reproduced at <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above)). We should
                        clarify that the <em>LCK</em> requirement is no longer
                        in itself a sufficient basis to impute constructive liability to B and C
                        (the secondary offenders) in this scenario. However, because the <em>LCK</em> requirement is satisfied, the court may infer
                        that the common intention of A, B and C was in fact not merely to rob D
                        without causing him physical harm, but was instead to rob D and, if
                        necessary, kill D in order to successfully carry out the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In reviewing the scope of s 34, we also examined a number of decisions of
                    the Supreme Court of India on s 34 IPC. These decisions are relevant since,
                    as mentioned at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above, s 34 is
                    merely a re-enactment of s 34 IPC. In principle, there is no reason for our
                    law on s 34 to be different from India’s law on s 34 IPC. These
                    decisions are discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    In <em>Hardev Singh and another v The State of
                        Punjab</em> AIR 1975 SC 179, the Supreme Court of India,
                    using the terms “act” and “crime” interchangeably,
                    said (at [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The view of the High Court [of Punjab and Haryana] that even the person
                        not committing the particular crime could be held guilty of that crime with
                        the aid of Section 34 of the [IPC] if the commission of the act was
                        such as could be shown to be in furtherance of the common intention not
                        necessarily intended by every one of the participants … is not
                        correct. <em>The common intention must be to commit the
                            particular crime, although the actual crime may be committed by any one
                            sharing the common intention</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Similarly, in <em>Bhaba Nanda Sarma</em> (the facts of
                    which were outlined earlier at <a href="#p1_142">[142]</a>
                    above), the Supreme Court of India said (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To attract the application of S. 34 it must be established beyond any
                        shadow of doubt that the criminal act was done by several persons in
                        furtherance of the common intention of all. In other words, the prosecution
                        must prove facts to justify an inference that <em>all the
                            participants of the act had shared a common intention to commit the
                            criminal act which was finally committed by one or more of the
                            participants</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    In <em>Surat Singh and another v State of Punjab</em>
                    AIR 1977 SC 705 (“<em>Surat
                    Singh</em>”), the facts were as follows. Three persons
                    (“Shingara”, “CS” and “Surat”) went to
                    the house of the victim (“KS”). Shingara instigated CS to kill KS,
                    whereupon CS dealt a blow with a spear to the left side of KS’s chest.
                    After KS fell down, Surat dealt two hatchet blows to the left arm of KS, causing
                    simple injuries. Shingara, CS and Surat were charged with murder under
                    s 302 of the IPC read with s 34 IPC. The trial court acquitted all
                    three men. On appeal, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana upheld
                    Shingara’s acquittal, but convicted CS and Surat of murder. On further
                    appeal, the Supreme Court of India affirmed CS’s conviction for murder
                    (save that the court amended the charge against CS from one under s 302 of
                    the IPC read with s 34 IPC to one under s 302 <em>per
                        se</em>). In contrast, the court allowed Surat’s appeal. It held
                    that since Surat had only caused KS simple hurt, he could not be said to have
                    shared the common intention of causing KS’s death. The court thus set
                    aside the conviction of Surat for murder and convicted him instead of the
                    offence under s 324 of the IPC (<em>viz</em>, the
                    offence of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or dangerous means).
                    The court said (at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The High Court [of Punjab and Haryana] says “These facts admit of
                        no doubt that the injuries were caused by both [CS and Surat] in furtherance
                        of their common intention.” It did not say that the common intention
                        was to cause death or to cause such injuries which on [an] objective test
                        were found to be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
                        The fact that [Surat] caused only two simple injuries on the arm of [KS] and
                        did not give any blow on any vital part of the body goes against the view
                        that he had shared the common intention of causing the death of [KS]. But
                        surely [CS] was guilty of causing the death of [KS] by giving the fatal blow
                        with [the] spear on his chest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This judgment may be compared with Wee CJ’s illustration at [25] of

                    AIR 1978 SC 1492 (“<em>Dharam

                    third accused (“Samme”) accompanied the first accused
                    (“DP”) and his father (“RS”) to teach one Hari Ram
                    (“HR”) a lesson in connection with an altercation. HR tried to run
                    away when he saw RS, DP, Surta and Samme armed with weapons coming for him. DP
                    shot one Sardara (a bystander who had run to HR’s rescue) in the neck,
                    resulting in Sardara’s death 12 days later. DP, Surta and Samme were
                    charged with and convicted of murder in furtherance of a common intention. The
                    Supreme Court of India upheld DP’s conviction, but set aside the
                    convictions of Surta and Samme on the ground that “[t]here [was] no
                    material to indicate that there was a pre-arranged plan to murder or to attempt
                    to commit the murder of any person who might intercede to save [HR]” (at
                    [13]). The court said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    It may be that when some persons start with a pre-arranged plan to
                            commit a minor offence, they may in the course of their committing the
                            minor offence come to an understanding to commit the major offence as
                            well. Such an understanding may appear from the conduct of the persons
                            sought to be made vicariously liable for the act of the principal
                            culprit or from some other incriminatory evidence but the conduct or
                            other evidence must be such as not to leave any room for doubt in that
                            behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    A criminal Court fastening vicarious liability must satisfy itself as
                            to the prior meeting of the minds of the principal culprit and his
                            companions who are sought to be constructively made liable in respect of
                            every act committed by the former. There is no law to our knowledge
                            which lays down that a person accompanying the principal culprit shares
                            his intention in respect of every act which the latter might eventually
                            commit. The existence or otherwise of the common intention depends upon
                            the facts and circumstances of each case. The intention of the principal
                            offender and his companions to deal with any person who might intervene
                            to stop the quarrel must be apparent from the conduct of the persons
                            accompanying the principal culprit or [from] some other clear and cogent
                            incriminating piece of evidence. In the absence of such material, the
                            companion or companions cannot justifiably be held guilty for every
                            offence committed by the principal offender. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In <em>Munna and Ayyia v State of U P</em>
                    AIR 1993 SC 278 (“<em>Munna</em>”),
                    the two accused (“Munna” and “Ayyia”) shared a
                    common intention to beat up the victim (“Nafis”), but not to kill
                    him. In the course of the beating, Munna brought out a knife and stabbed Nafis,
                    killing him. The trial court convicted Munna of murder under s 302 of the
                    IPC, and also convicted Ayyia of the same offence under s 302 read with
                    s 34 IPC. On appeal, the Supreme Court of India upheld Munna’s
                    conviction for murder, but set aside Ayyia’s conviction for that offence
                    and substituted it with a conviction for the offence of voluntarily causing
                    grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or dangerous means under s 326 of the
                    IPC read with s 34 IPC. The court said (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ayyia[,] though armed with a razor[,] did not choose to use the same.
                        Ayyia had no idea that [Munna] would take out the knife and cause the fatal
                        injury to [Nafis]. In the circumstances, it is difficult to attribute to
                        [Ayyia] a common intention to kill [Nafis] and convict him with the aid of
                        Section 34. At the most since [Ayyia] knew [Munna] was carrying a
                        weapon and was smarting under an insult [dealt by Nafis,] he could be said
                        to be aware of the fact that there was a possibility of Munna causing
                        injury. One can infer that [Ayyia] shared the common intention to beat up or
                        assault [Nafis] though not to kill him. In the circumstances, we think that
                        his conviction under Section 302/34 needs to be altered to [a
                        conviction under] Section 326/34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In <em>Mithu Singh v State of Punjab</em> AIR 2001
                    SC 1929 (“<em>Mithu Singh</em>”), the
                    accused (“Mithu”) accompanied one Bharpur Singh
                    (“BS”) to the house of the victim (“GK”), each
                    carrying a pistol. Mithu knew that there was enmity between BS and GK arising
                    out of a civil dispute. When Mithu and BS reached GK’s house, BS fired a
                    shot at GK and killed her. Mithu and BS then fled. They were subsequently
                    charged with and convicted of murder in furtherance of a common intention under
                    s 302 of the IPC read with s 34 IPC. They were also convicted of the
                    offence under s 27 of the Arms Act 1959 (Act 54 of 1959) (India)
                    (“the Indian Arms Act”) of possessing arms with intent to use them
                    for an unlawful purpose. The Supreme Court of India allowed in part the appeal
                    by Mithu and set aside his conviction for murder (the court, however, upheld his
                    conviction for the offence under s 27 of the Indian Arms Act). The court
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    … The allegation that [BS] and [Mithu] belong to one party
                            faction … is not based on any concrete fact wherefrom such an
                            inference may be drawn by the Court and … therefore does not go
                            beyond being merely a[n] ipse dixit of the witnesses. Therefore, the
                            question arises … [as to] whether an inference, as to [MS] having
                            shared a common intention to cause the death of [GK] with [BS], can be
                            drawn?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    To substantiate a charge under S. 302 with the aid of S. 34,
                            it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by
                            one of the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention of
                            … both. Common intention has to be distinguished from same or
                            similar intention. It is true that it is difficult, if not impossible,
                            to collect and produce direct evidence in proof of the intention of the
                            accused and mostly an inference as to intention shall have to be drawn
                            from the acts or conduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances,
                            as available. An inference as to common intention shall not be readily
                            drawn; the culpable liability can arise only if such inference can be
                            drawn with a certain degree of assurance. At the worst [Mithu] knew that
                            [BS] was armed with a pistol. The knowledge of previous enmity existing
                            between [BS] and [GK] can also be attributed to [Mithu]. But there is
                            nothing available on record to draw an inference that [BS] had gone to
                            the house of [GK] with the intention of causing her death and [that]
                                <em>such intention was known to [Mithu], much less
                                shared by him</em>. Simply because [Mithu] was himself armed
                            with a pistol[,] that would not necessarily lead to an inference that he
                            had also reached the house of [GK] or had accompanied [BS] <em>with the intention of causing the death of [GK]</em>.
                            In our opinion, an inference as to [Mithu] … having shared with
                            [BS] a common intention of causing the murder of [GK] cannot be drawn.
                            His conviction under S. 302/34, IPC cannot be sustained and must be
                            set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    It may be noted that in <em>Bhaba Nanda Sarma</em>,
                        <em>Surat Singh</em>, <em>Dharam
                        Pal</em>, <em>Munna</em> and <em>Mithu Singh</em>, the critical issue was whether the criminal act
                    done by the actual doer which gave rise to the offence charged was done in
                    furtherance of a common intention to cause death. In each of those cases, the
                    Indian Supreme Court was unwilling to infer from the facts that the criminal act
                    done by the actual doer (giving rise to the offence charged) was done in
                    furtherance of a common intention to cause death. No doubt, in some cases (such
                    as <em>Mithu Singh</em>), the Indian Supreme Court appeared
                    to have been excessively cautious in not drawing such an inference. The crucial
                    point to note, however, is that the Indian Supreme Court’s approach to
                    s 34 IPC is that this provision will apply only if the criminal act done by
                    several persons which results in the offence charged is done by one or more of
                    those persons in furtherance of a common intention to do that very criminal act
                        (<em>ie</em>, the criminal act which gives rise to the
                    offence charged).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In this regard, it is also pertinent to refer to <em>Emperor v
                        Mujjaffar Sheikh and another Accused</em> AIR 1941 Cal 106,
                    a decision of the High Court of Calcutta. In that case, the court said (at
                    109):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to make a person constructively liable with the aid of
                        S. 34, [IPC], for an offence not actually committed by him, it must
                        always be shown that the person so sought to be made liable had the
                        intention requisite for the constitution of that particular offence. Thus to
                        make him constructively liable under S. 34, [IPC], for murder,
                            <em>it must be proved that he had the intention of
                            committing murder in common with the person or persons who actually
                            committed the murder and who were his companions in the joint criminal
                            act or enterprise. Unless this intention is proved, he cannot be made
                            liable under the aforesaid section even though the murder [is] committed
                            in order to accomplish some other object or purpose shared in
                            common</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The decisions which we have referred to at <a href="#p1_170">[170]</a>–<a href="#p1_175">[175]</a> above
                    show that the Indian Supreme Court has settled on the view that the legislative
                    purpose of s 34 IPC is to make a secondary offender constructively liable
                    for the offence resulting from a criminal act done by another person (<em>ie</em>, the actual doer) only where the secondary offender
                    and the actual doer have a common intention to commit that particular criminal
                    act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    To conclude our examination of the scope of s 34, we would refer to an
                    offence in the Penal Code which, in our view, demonstrates that the putative
                        <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test has no basis in
                    principle, resulted in a distortion of the legislative policy of s 34 and
                    is a misbegotten principle resulting from a misunderstanding of what Wee CJ
                    said at [23] of <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>. That offence
                    is gang-robbery with murder under s 396 of the Penal Code, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any one of 5 or more persons who are conjointly committing gang-robbery
                        [as defined in s 391 of the Penal Code] … commits murder in so
                        committing gang-robbery, every one of those persons shall be punished with
                        death <em>or imprisonment for life</em>, and if he is
                        not sentenced to death, shall also be punished with caning of not less than
                        12 strokes. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Gang-robbery is, by definition, an offence which is committed <em>conjointly</em> by five or more persons (see the definition
                    of “gang-robbery” in s 391 of the Penal Code); this implies
                    that all the members of the gang must participate in the robbery with a common
                    intention to rob. Where murder is committed in the course of a gang-robbery, at
                    least one member of the gang must have had the intention to either cause the
                    victim’s death (see s 300(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Penal Code) or inflict on the victim one of the types of injury set out in
                        ss 300(<em>b</em>)–300(<em>d</em>) of the Penal Code, even if the rest of the gang members had
                    no such intention; otherwise, no murder (as defined in s 300) would have
                    been committed. In a case of gang-robbery with murder, the court has the
                        <em>discretion</em> to sentence the gang members to
                    either death or life imprisonment with caning, depending on their respective
                    roles in the robbery and the murder (<em>cf</em> the
                        <em>mandatory</em> sentence of death where the offence
                    charged is that of murder). Members of the gang who, in the court’s view,
                    do not deserve the death sentence are punished instead with life imprisonment
                    plus at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The difference between gang-robbery with murder and what we shall hereafter
                    term “murder in a non-gang-robbery scenario” (<em>ie</em>, murder committed in the course of a robbery carried out by a
                    gang of less than five members) is this: in the former case, s 34 does not
                    need to be invoked to hold the gang members who are secondary offenders liable
                    for murder since s 396 of the Penal Code expressly states that all members
                    of the gang “shall be punished”; in the latter case, however,
                    s 34 needs to be relied on if the Prosecution seeks to charge those members
                    of the gang who are secondary offenders with murder. If the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test does indeed reflect how
                    s 34 is meant to be applied, the result would be that where liability for
                    murder in a non-gang-robbery scenario is concerned, it is not necessary for all
                    the members of the gang to have a common intention to kill or cause the death of
                    the victim before they can be convicted of murder; instead, they can be thus
                    convicted so long as one of them kills the victim or causes his death in
                    furtherance of the common intention to rob.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Thus, if the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test
                    is a correct statement of the law (<em>ie</em>, if it is
                    indeed the law that B can be held constructively liable for an offence arising
                    from a criminal act done by A even if B does not have a common intention with A
                    to commit that criminal act), then, where murder is committed in the course of a
                    gang-robbery, there would be no reason for the Prosecution to rely on s 396
                    of the Penal Code, which requires proof of, specifically, an intention on the
                    part of at least one member of the gang to commit one of the criminal acts set
                    out in s 300. It would be far easier for the Prosecution to simply rely,
                    instead, on s 300 of the Penal Code read with s 34 because –
                    according to the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    test – it would then be unnecessary for the Prosecution to prove a common
                    intention among all the gang members to commit one of the criminal acts set out
                    in s 300. All that would be needed is proof that the criminal act
                    constituting the offence of murder was committed in furtherance of a common
                    intention to engage in some “unity of criminal behaviour” (see
                        <em>Barendra (PC)</em> at 9) – a condition
                    which would invariably be satisfied since the actual doer must have committed
                    that criminal act in furtherance of the gang members’ common intention to
                    commit robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    However, the fact is that s 396 of the Penal Code has been retained all
                    these years and currently still remains in this form. This indicates that the
                    Legislature does <em>not</em> intend the members of a gang,
                    where gang-robbery with murder is committed, to be prosecuted for murder based
                    on s 300 read with s 34. The result is that the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test would apply <em>vis-à-vis</em> murder in a non-gang-robbery scenario (where the
                    offence charged (<em>viz</em>, murder) is punishable with
                    the <em>mandatory</em> death penalty), whereas s 396
                    of the Penal Code would apply in a case of gang robbery with murder (where the
                    death penalty is <em>discretionary</em> for the offence
                    charged) – even though the latter (<em>ie</em>,
                    gang-robbery with murder) is, paradoxically, the more serious offence in so far
                    as it involves a larger number of people jointly participating in a criminal
                    enterprise. This result is not rational from a policy point of view as
                    gang-robbery should be regarded as a more serious threat to the safety of the
                    community than a robbery which is not a gang-robbery, given that gang-robbery
                    involves, by definition, a larger number of robbers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In short, if the putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>
                    test were good law, there would be a misalignment between, on the one hand, the
                    legislative policy on gang-robbery with murder and, on the other hand, the
                    legislative policy on murder in a non-gang-robbery scenario (as well as the
                    legislative policy on the imposition of constructive liability on secondary
                    offenders pursuant to s 34 generally). In our view, it is desirable that
                    the legislative policy underlying s 34 be aligned with that underlying
                    s 396 of the Penal Code. These two legislative policies have been
                    misaligned ever since the putative <em>Mimi
                        Wong (CCA)</em> test arose. Our restatement of the law on
                    s 34 will align these two legislative policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    For the reasons given above, we allow this appeal in so far as Daniel and
                    Christopher are concerned and set aside their convictions for murder. We shall,
                    in substitution, convict them of the offence of robbery with hurt under
                    s 394 of the Penal Code read with s 34. We order this case, in so far
                    as Daniel and Christopher are concerned, to be remitted to the Judge for
                    sentencing on a date to be fixed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    As for Bala, notwithstanding his confirmation at the hearing before this court
                    on 9 April 2009 that he is no longer challenging his conviction for murder,
                    we have reviewed his conviction and we agree with the Judge’s decision
                    that he is guilty of murder. We accordingly uphold his conviction for murder,
                    save that the charge against him is to be amended to one under s 302 of the
                    Penal Code <em>per se</em>, and dismiss this appeal where
                    he is concerned.</p>
