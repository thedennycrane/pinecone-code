<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Shinsung Eng Co. Ltd
                    (“the defendant”) in Registrar’s Appeal No 397 of 2011
                    (“the Appeal”) against the decision of the Assistant Registrar in
                    granting Republic Airconditioning (S) Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”)
                    summary judgment for the sum of $323,500.31 together with interest. I dismissed
                    the Appeal. As the defendant has appealed (in Civil Appeal No 9 of 2012)
                    against my decision, I now set out the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore, while the defendant is a Korean company registered in Singapore whose
                    business comprises of building and construction works in Singapore. In or about
                    December 2009, the defendant secured a project with Rolls Royce Pte Ltd for the
                    erection of a single-user industrial factory at the Seletar Aerospace Park
                    (“the project”). On 2 September 2010, the defendant entered
                    into an agreement with the plaintiff (“the contract”), for the
                    latter to supply labour for the project. The contract sets out, <em>inter alia</em>, the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The daily rates for skilled workers
                        and semi-skilled workers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     The normal working hours and what constituted
                        over-time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
                        all workers were to be equipped with the necessary personal protective
                        equipment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        process for invoicing and payment of the labour charges;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     That the plaintiff could remove its
                        workers from the construction site immediately without further notice in the
                        event of non-payment of the labour charges;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     That any medical expenses arising from injuries
                        that ocurred on the worksite would be claimable under the defendant’s
                        workmen compensation account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     That the plaintiff guaranteed that the workers were
                        holders of valid work permits;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Pursuant to the contract, the plaintiff issued
                    various invoices to the defendant for payment of the labour charges. As the
                    defendant failed to pay on some of the invoices (“the outstanding
                    invoices”), the plaintiff removed their workers from the construction
                    site on 11 November 2010 and stopped work with effect from 12 November
                    2010. On 18 March 2011, the defendant sent an “Audit
                    Confirmation” to the plaintiff, acknowledging that there was a sum of
                    $389,950.96 owing from the defendant to the plaintiff, and that nothing was owed
                    by the plaintiff to the defendant. That figure was later amended by the
                    plaintiff to reflect the reduced sum of $323,500.31, to take into account an
                    invoice rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant dated 11 November 2010
                    for $23,549.36 (a debit), and a payment of $90,000 (a credit) made by the
                    defendant to the plaintiff on 14 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 13 May 2011, the plaintiff commenced
                    this action against the defendant for the sum of $323,500.31 (“the
                    sum”), due and owing under the contract. On 7 December 2011, the
                    plaintiff was granted summary judgment by the Assistant Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before me, the defendant sought to over-turn the
                    Assistant Registrar’s decision and to ask for unconditional leave to
                    defend by asserting that the following amounted to triable issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the contract was only for the
                        supply of labour or also for Air-conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation
                        works (“ACMV works”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the plaintiff’s claim for the sum was a sham
                        claim based on “phantom” workers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether plaintiff’s claim was illegal and
                        unenforceable as it was carrying on the business of an unlicensed employment
                        agency without the proper work permits for the workers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the plaintiff had wrongfully
                        repudiated the contract giving rise to the defence of set-off and a
                        counterclaim by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In addition, the defendant argued that the Audit
                    Confirmation did not amount to an admission, and that the two payments made to
                    the plaintiff on 9 November 2010 and 14 January 2011 were without
                    prejudice and did not undermine its defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff countered the defendant’s
                    arguments by submitting that the Audit Confirmation amounted to an admission by
                    the defendant, that the sum was due and owing by the defendant to the plaintiff,
                    and that nothing was owed by the plaintiff to the defendant. It was further
                    argued that the purported defences and counterclaims raised by the defendant
                    were devoid of merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       First, the plaintiff submitted that the
                    defendant had no valid counter-claim or set-off for defective ACMV works as the
                    contract was only for the supply of labour. Second, it was argued that the
                    defendant’s assertion that the plaintiff was using “phantom”
                    workers to over-claim labour charges was without merit and calculated to avoid
                    payment of the labour charges. Third, the defendant’s claim for defective
                    ACMV works was insufficiently particularised and vague. Fourth, the
                    defendant’s claim that the contract was tainted with illegality was
                    misguided because the plaintiff was not an employment agency and thus, did not
                    require a licence under the Employment Agencies Act (Cap 92, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) (“Employment Agencies Act”). In addition, the plaintiff
                    pointed out that the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff did not have
                    authorised work permits was not pleaded in the defence and was clearly raised as
                    an afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on summary judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The power of the court to grant summary judgment
                    is found under O 14 r 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). The primary concern of the
                    courts in determining whether summary judgment ought to be granted is whether
                    the plaintiff is truly entitled to this relief at this stage and, by the same
                    token, whether it is just to deprive the defendant of the opportunity to
                    challenge the plaintiff’s claim at trial (see <em>Singapore
                        Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009)
                        [“<em>Singapore Court Practice</em>”] at
                    para. 14/3/1). The law governing summary judgment is trite and had been
                    succinctly stated by Prakash J in <em>Associated Development Pte Ltd v Loong Sie </em><em>Kiong Gerald</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 389 at
                        [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...that in order to obtain judgment, a plaintiff has first to show that he
                        has a <em>prima facie</em> case for judgment.
                        Once he has done that, the burden shifts to the defendant who, in order to
                        obtain leave to defend, must establish that there is a fair or reasonable
                        probability that he has a real or <em>bona
                            fide</em> defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Court of Appeal in <em>Goh
                        Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 held that
                    leave to defend will not be granted based upon “mere assertions”
                    by defendants; instead, the court will look at the whole situation critically to
                    examine whether the defence is credible. In the Privy Council case of <em>Eng Yong v Letchumanan</em> [1979] MLJ 212
                    at 217, Lord Diplock explained it as thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although in the normal way it is not appropriate for a judge to attempt to
                        resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit, this does not mean that he is
                        bound to accept uncritically, as raising a dispute of fact which calls for
                        further investigation, every statement on an affidavit however equivocal,
                        lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or
                        other statements by the same deponent, or inherently improbable in itself it
                        may be. In making such order on the application as ‘he may think
                        just’ the judge is vested with a discretion which he must exercise
                        judicially. It is for him to determine in the first instance whether
                        statements contained in affidavits that are relied upon as raising a
                        conflict of evidence upon a relevant fact have sufficient prima facie
                        plausibility to merit further investigation as to their truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Indeed, while the summary jurisdiction of the
                    court is to be exercised with great circumspection, the court must also be wary
                    of defendants who seek to evade summary liability by throwing out spurious
                    allegations, assertions and afterthoughts as convenient smoke screens, which
                    they neatly label as <em>bona fide</em> defences raising
                    triable issues. In seeking to delay the inevitable, as it were, such defendants
                    end up not only wasting precious court resources, but more importantly, could
                    potentially cause serious hardship and irreparable loss to the plaintiff seeking
                    vindication of his/her claim, for some of whom time is of the essence. In
                        <em>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies v Torie
                        Construction</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 901 (not cited by either
                    party) at [21], GP Selvam JC argued
                    for a more robust approach in summary proceedings in order to resolve disputes
                    at this stage, if possible, rather than to unnecessarily allow cases to go to
                    trial:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There will be no hardship or injustice to a claimant who is
                        content to have his claim determined at the trial together with the cross
                        claims against him. But delay in having to wait for the trial in many cases
                        may cause severe or even irreparable loss to the plaintiff. Lawton LJ in
                            <em>Ellis Mechanical Services v Wates Construction
                            Ltd</em> [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 33 at 36 said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">One of the perils of commercial life for sub-contractors in the
                            building trade is that there may develop between the main contractor and
                            the building owner a serious dispute which leads to one or other of them
                            repudiating the main contract. When that happens the lifeblood of the
                            building trade, namely money, stops. It seems to me that the
                            administration of justice in our Courts should do all it can to restore
                            the lifeblood as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Courts are aware of what happens in these building disputes; cases
                            go either to arbitration or before an official referee; they drag on and
                            on and on; the cash flow is held up. In the majority of cases, because
                            one party or the other cannot wait any longer for the money, there is
                            some kind of compromise, very often not based on the justice of the case
                            but on the financial situation of one of the parties. That sort of
                            result is to be avoided if possible. In my judgment it can be avoided if
                            the Courts make a robust approach… to the jurisdiction under
                            O 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present day context, it is in summary judgment applications that
                        the defendant raises the set-off defence. In order to make a robust approach
                        it is the duty of the court to closely examine points of set-off raised by
                        the defendant and to ensure that the true purpose is not to cause delay to
                        the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The same point was put across more succinctly

                            Construction</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 901 a rule of practice
                        was stated to the effect that the courts should take a robust approach when
                        considering applications for summary judgment particularly in commercial and
                        construction cases where cash flow is the life blood to make commerce work.
                        The rigour of that rule is being applied to good end. It has earned a good
                        reputation for Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     With these principles in mind, I turn now to
                    examine the various defences and counterclaims raised by the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scope of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant first took issue with the scope
                    of the contract, claiming that it encompassed not only the supply of labour for
                    the project, but also the carrying out of ACMV works. As a corollary to that,
                    the defendant further claimed since the contract encompassed ACMV works, it had
                    a set-off by way of a defence and/or a counterclaim in relation to what it
                    claimed was the cost of rectifying the defective ACMV works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Recourse to the contract itself showed that
                    the defendant’s claims on the scope of the contract were entirely
                    unmeritorious. It was undisputed by the defendant that there was nothing in the
                    contract itself which referred to ACMV works: indeed, as is evident from
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the contract merely listed out
                    the various terms on which the plaintiff was to supply workers to the defendant
                    for the purposes of the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Instead, the defendant attempted to rely on
                    the “factual matrix” to establish what it claimed was “the
                    true nature of the agreement”, which purportedly encompassed the ACMV
                    works. While it is accepted that the context in which the contract was made is
                    relevant to the interpretation of that contract, what the defendant sought to do
                    was to import an entire meaning to the contract, totally inconsistent with a
                    plain reading of its terms, which clearly suggested that the contract was
                    limited to the supply of labour. In <em>Sandar
                        </em><em>Aung v Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 891 (cited by the defendant), the
                    Court of Appeal, after establishing that the factual context played a role in
                    contractual interpretation, was quick to caution at [36] against the reliance on amorphous conceptions of the
                    ‘factual background’ to flout a “business commonsense”
                    reading of contracts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, Lord Hoffman did, in the subsequent House of Lords decision
                        of <em>Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v
                            Ali</em> [2002] 1 AC 251 state (at [39]) that while “there is no
                        conceptual limit to what can be regarded as background”, he was
                        “certainly not encouraging a trawl through ‘background’
                        which could not have made a reasonable person think that the parties must
                        have departed from conventional usage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In any event, looking at the evidence which
                    the defendant relied on, it was difficult to see how the scope of the contract
                    could be extended to encompass the ACMV works. Specifically, the defendant
                    relied on the fact that the plaintiff rendered invoices for “duct
                    works” as indicative that the contract encompassed the ACMV works. That
                    reliance, however, was misconceived for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “duct works” were
                        separately invoiced from the labour charges, which were invoiced daily as
                        part of a series of progress claims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The invoices for the labour charges followed the
                        quotation set out in the contract; in contrast, the quotation for the
                        “duct works”, which was different from the quotation for the
                        labour charges, was nowhere to be found in the contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The invoices for the labour charges
                        all referred to the “namelist claim”, which was the timesheet
                        submitted by the plaintiff to the defendant at the end of each working day.
                        Again, this was explicitly provided for in the contract; in contrast, the
                        “duct work” invoices bore no reference to the “namelist
                        claim”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Payment of the labour charges by the defendant was based only on the
                        timesheets (<em>i.e.</em> time the workers spent
                        working) and not on the nature of the work carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the scope of the contract was limited to the supply of labour and did not
                    include the ACMV works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In relation to the defendant’s purported
                    set-off defence and/or counterclaim for the defective ACMV works, beyond mere
                    assertions, the defendant did not provide any evidence of the purported contract
                    for ACMV works it entered into with the plaintiff, much less the terms of that
                    contract. Neither did the defendant show how it was that the plaintiff caused
                    the defects, save for producing a laundry list of purported defects. Indeed, as
                    the plaintiff pointed out, there was not a single contemporaneous letter sent by
                    the defendant to the plaintiff in 2010 alleging that the ACMV works were
                    defective, which was striking given that the defendant was now claiming the cost
                    of rectification to be over $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Purported repudiation by plaintiff of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is apt, at this juncture, to deal with the
                    defendant’s claim that the plaintiff had repudiated the contract on
                    12 November 2010 by withdrawing its workers from the project site and
                    ceasing work. Essentially, what the defendant was claiming here was that it was
                    entitled to the defence of set-off, by virtue of its cross-claim on the
                    plaintiff’s alleged wrongful repudiation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant’s argument here
                    illustrated starkly the evil the court must guard against when dealing with
                    applications for summary judgment (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above): <em>i.e.</em> the desperate
                    defendant who slings as many arguments as he/she can, no matter how frivolous,
                    hoping that one sticks. The defendant cited two authorities which supposedly
                    supported its argument that in construction and building contracts, failure to
                    make payment was not a valid reason to abandon works and such abandonment
                    amounted to wrongful repudiation: <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em>,<em>vol </em>2 (LexisNexis
                    2003) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                    Singapore</em>”) at [30.310] and <em>Jia Min
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR(R) 288 (“<em>Jia
                    Min</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Both authorities, however, state clearly that
                    while there was no general right to suspend works, this was subject to the
                    parties expressly providing for such a right in their contract (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at [30.310] and
                        <em>Jia Min</em> at [55]). Under the heading
                    “Invoicing and Payment” in the contract, it was stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...In the event that our claims to you are not fully settled on time, we
                        reserve our rights to claim all dues through legal means and remove all our
                        workers from your site immediately without any further notice to your
                        company. We will not be responsible, in any way, for any delays to your work
                        schedule and losses suffered as a result of our cessation of work due to
                        your non-payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It suffices to say that, in the light of the above, the
                    defendant’s claim here simply did not hold water.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Phantom” workers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Next, I turn to the defendant’s
                    assertion that the plaintiff’s labour charges incorporated billings for
                    “phantom” workers who were not present and did not carry out works
                    for the defendant. What was notable about the defendant’s allegations here
                    was that they were consistently vague and feeble throughout, such as to call
                    into question the <em>bona fides</em> of its
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For instance, while the defendant had
                    obliquely raised the issue in three letters sent on 4 November 2010,
                    8 November 2010, and 11 November 2010, stating that “there was
                    an inconsistency and discrepancies on your workers signature reflect (<em>sic</em>) in the name list time sheet”, it did little
                    more to follow through with its complaint. Indeed, there was no attempt by the
                    defendant to either identify the workers and/or the signatures it was disputing,
                    or to set out in any detail/ tabulate its claim about the phantom workers. In
                    fact, the defendant continued to make payments to the plaintiff on
                    9 November 2010 ($70,000), and on 14 January 2011 ($90,000), after
                    solicitors’ letters had been exchanged. While the defendant claimed that
                    the $70,000 payment was made to help the plaintiff resolve its financial
                    difficulties, and that the $90,000 payment was made without prejudice to its
                    rights, the fact that those payments were even made was odd given the serious
                    allegation that the plaintiff was fabricating sham claims on the labour charges.
                    Coupled with the lack of any genuine attempt to follow through with the
                    complaint, this raised serious doubts on the <em>bona
                        fides</em> of the defendant’s “phantom” worker
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Audit Confirmation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     More importantly, on 18 March 2011, the
                    defendant sent the plaintiff an Audit Confirmation, effectively admitting the
                    plaintiff’s claim for the sum, and conceding that it did not owe any debt
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In both <em>Gobind
                        </em><em>Lalwani v Basco Enterprises Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1998] 3 SLR(R) 1019 (“<em>Gobind</em>”) at [7] and
                        <em>Capital Realty Pte Ltd v Chip Thye Enterprises (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 419 (“<em>Capital Realty</em>”) (decision of the Court of Appeal) at
                        [24], it was held that an audit
                    confirmation, while not conclusive, constituted strong <em>prima
                        facie</em> evidence of a debt. As per Lord Cave in <em>Camillo Tank SS Co Ltd v Alexandria Engineering Works</em>
                    (1921) 38 TLR 134 at 143 (cited in <em>Gobind</em> at
                        [7] as the <em>locus
                        classicus</em> on account stated):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An account stated in this sense is no more than an admission of a debt out
                        of court; and while it is no doubt cogent evidence against the admitting
                        party and throws upon him the burden of proving that the debt is not due, it
                        may, like any other admission, be shown to have been made in error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Re Bentimi Pte Ltd; In
                        the matter of Part X of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (1994 Revised Edition)
                        v In the Matter of Bentimi Pte Ltd</em> [2003] SGHC 92
                        (“<em>Re Bentimi”</em>), Choo Han
                    Teck J distinguished <em>Gobind</em> and <em>Capital Realty</em> but on the basis that the circumstances
                    indicated that “there appeared to be sufficient incongruities in the
                    petitioner’s case to suggest that this is not a matter that ought to be
                    decided on the strength of one document”. Choo J therefore
                    distinguished <em>Gobind</em> and <em>Capital Realty</em> on the facts: a consideration of the totality of
                    the circumstances in that case revealed doubts about the probative value of the
                    audit confirmation. <em>Re Bentimi</em> was therefore
                    consistent with the holding in <em>Gobind</em> and
                        <em>Capital Realty</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant sought to distinguish both
                        <em>Gobind</em> and <em>Capital
                        Realty</em> on the basis that in both cases, it was decided that the
                    audit confirmation amounted to a clear admission only after a trial and not
                    during an application for summary judgment. With respect, that argument missed
                    the point totally. Although in an application for summary judgment - unlike a
                    trial – it is not appropriate for the court to delve into a precise
                    evaluation of the merits of the rival contentions or to assess the relative
                    probabilities, it is nevertheless obliged to look at the totality of the
                    situation critically to examine whether the defence raised by the defendant is
                    credible. In approaching this (albeit limited) inquiry, the court is certainly
                    allowed to take into account all available evidence, including the Audit
                    confirmation, to decide if a <em>bona fide</em> defence has
                    been raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, there was nothing to
                    suggest that strong <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the
                    Audit Confirmation in showing the existence of an admitted debt ought to be
                    disregarded. Indeed, the Audit Confirmation was sent by the defendant to the
                    plaintiff on 18 March 2011, more than four months after the plaintiff
                    ceased work on the project, and after the defendant purportedly raised its
                    various defences via letters exchanged between the parties. Yet there was no
                    mention in the Audit Confirmation about the various assertions
                    (“phantom” workers; defective ACMV works etc) now made by the
                    defendant, save for an unequivocal admission by the defendant that it owed
                    monies to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Not unexpectedly, the defendant also claimed
                    that the Audit Confirmation was “only to facilitate their
                    accounting” and did not amount to an admission. That was an entirely
                    self-serving position, with nothing to convince me otherwise. In fact, the
                    defendant did not either deny the reliability of the Audit Confirmation or argue
                    that it was erroneous. It was simply contented to make the bare assertion that
                    the Audit Confirmation was provided “only to facilitate their accounting
                    and can be explained at the trial of the said matter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     From the above, it was evident that, when the
                    entire case was looked at critically, shorn of speculative and unsubstantiated
                    assertions, the defendant’s case raised no serious triable
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Nevertheless, there remained a final string to
                    the defendant’s bow. The defendant claimed that the contract was tainted
                    with illegality for two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the plaintiff was carrying
                        out the business of an employment agency without a valid licence under
                        s 6 of the Employment Agencies Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the contract was in breach of 5(3) of
                        the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed)
                        (“Employment of Foreign Manpower Act”), read together with the
                        Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Pass) Regulations (Cap 91A,
                        2009 Rev Ed) (“Work Pass
                Regulations”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On (a), s 6 of the Employment Agencies
                    Act applies only to employment agencies. Section 2 of the Employment Agencies
                    Act defines “employment agency” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“employment agency” means any agency or registry carried on
                        or represented as being or intended to be carried on (whether for the
                        purpose of gain or reward or not) for or in connection with the employment
                        of persons in any capacity, but <em>does not include any
                            registry set up by an employer for the sole purpose of recruiting
                            persons for employment on his own behalf;</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It had always been the plaintiff’s case
                    that it was not an employment agency as it was itself the employer of the
                    workers. The contract itself (under the term “Indemnity”) revealed
                    that it was the plaintiff itself who was responsible for the welfare of the
                    workers, including the payment of wages, individual taxation and the payment of
                    levies; the defendant was merely charged a daily rate for the workers provided
                    by the plaintiff. At all times, the plaintiff was and remained the employer of
                    the workers, and thus cannot be said to be an ‘employment agency’.
                    There was accordingly, no basis on which s 6 of the Employment Agencies Act
                    was applicable to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On (b), the first thing to be noted was that
                    this issue was not pleaded in the defence- only the issue relating to s 6
                    of the Employment Agencies Act was pleaded. The law in this area, <em>vis-a-vis</em> the question of whether a party challenging an
                    O 14 Rules of Court application is entitled to rely on or raise any
                    unpleaded defence, appears to be in a state of flux. The following string of
                    High Court decisions (none of which were cited by the parties), <em>Lim Leong Huat v Chip Hup </em><em>Hup
                        </em><em>Kee Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 786 (“<em>Lim Leong
                        </em><em>Huat</em>”), <em>United States Trading Co Pte Ltd v Ting Boon Aun</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 981 (“<em>United States
                        Trading</em>”), <em>HSBC Institutional Trust
                        (Singapore) v Elchemi Assets Pte Ltd and another</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 67 had established the position that if a respondent to an
                    application for summary judgment failed to plead all the defences he intended to
                    rely on in his pleading, any fresh defence that was not pleaded could not be
                    relied on unless the defence was amended, or in exceptional cases where the
                    court found that there were good reasons to allow that to be done (see also
                    Singapore Court Practice at para. 14/3/2A). In coming to that position, the
                    cases over-ruled an earlier Malaysian decision in <em>Lin
                        Securities (Pte) v Noone &amp; Co Sdn </em><em>Bhd</em> [1989] 1 MLJ 321 ("<em>Lin Securities</em>") where it was said at p 322:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No doubt a defendant is bound by the four corners of his pleading at the
                        trial of the action but he is not so bound at the O 14 proceedings.
                        Order 14 r 4(1) provides that a defendant may show cause against an
                        application for summary judgment by affidavit or otherwise. He is entitled
                        to show at the hearing of the O 14 application that over and above what
                        has been pleaded in the statement of defence he has other defences. The
                        issue at an O 14 application is whether the defendant has a defence and
                        not whether the statement of defence provides him with a defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, the Court of Appeal subsequently in
                    the oft-cited case of <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace
                        Inc</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Poh
                        Soon Kiat</em>”) at [15], appeared to adopt the position set out in <em>Lin Securities</em>, albeit without the benefit of having had
                    its attention drawn to the High Court decisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    In this connection, the Appellant applied to this
                            court via SUM 1312/2009 for leave to amend his defence to plead that the
                            2001 California Judgment was not a foreign money judgment ... We
                            declined to hear this application and treated it as withdrawn. In our
                            view, it was an unnecessary application as, in summary judgment
                            proceedings, “[a] defendant may raise defences in his affidavit
                            even if they are not referred to in the pleaded defence”
                                (see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                                2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                            Asia, 2007) at para 14/2/12) and is “bound by the four
                            corners of his pleadings [only] at the trial of the action
                            but...not...[in] the O. 14 <em>ie</em>, summary
                            judgment] proceedings”...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Rankine Bernadette
                        Adeline v Chenet Finance Ltd</em> [2011] 3 SLR 756
                        (“<em>Rankine</em>”) at [23], the court suggested that the Court of
                    Appeal would have dealt with the issue differently had its attention been drawn
                    to the High Court cases. That observation was repeated recently in <em>PMA Credit Opportunities Fund and others v Tantono Tiny
                        (representative of the estate of Lim Susanto, deceased)</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 1021. While I concur with the court in <em>Rankine</em> that there is room for greater clarity and
                    certainty on this issue (see [23]
                    of <em>Rankine</em>), in the light of the Court of Appeal
                    decision in <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em>, I was unable to exclude
                    the defence raised by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Nevertheless, the question remained whether
                    the defendant’s claim that the contract was tainted by illegality by
                    virtue of a breach of s 5(3) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act,
                    read together with the Work Pass Regulations, was a <em>bona
                        fide</em> defence. While the defendant’s argument here was, to
                    put it charitably, rather nebulous, I understood its argument to be that the
                    plaintiff was in breach by virtue of the fact that at least two of the workers
                    supplied under the contract were obtained from the plaintiff’s
                    sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For convenience, I set out the material
                    provisions. Section 5(3) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall employ a foreign employee otherwise than in accordance
                        with the conditions of the foreign employee’s work pass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Paragraph 2 of the First Schedule (Part II) of the Work Pass
                    Regulations states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Except as provided in paragraphs 7 to 13 of
                            Part III</em> (emphasis added), the foreign employee shall be
                        under the employer’s direct employment and the employer shall be
                        responsible for the control and supervision of the foreign employee. The
                        employer shall not permit the foreign employee to be employed by or
                        contracted to any other person or business to do work for that person or
                        business. The employer shall not employ the foreign employee in either an
                        occupation or a sector which is different from that specified in the work
                        permit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Paragraph 7 of the First Schedule (Part III) of the Work Pass
                    Regulations (“Paragraph 7 of the First Schedule”), however, which
                    specifically applies to foreign workers who are construction workers, in turn
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding paragraph 5, an employer may, with the consent of the
                        foreign employee, enter into a contract for the supply of labour with an
                        eligible third party engaged in the construction industry, in relation to a
                        foreign employee to whom the conditions in this Part apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For completeness, paragraph 5 the First Schedule (Part III) of the
                    Work Pass Regulations simply states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to paragraph 7, the employer shall ensure that the foreign
                        employee is not sent to work for any other person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant appeared to have omitted to have
                    regard to the proviso “<em>Except as provided in
                        paragraphs 7 to 13 of Part III</em>” in Paragraph 2
                    of the First Schedule (Part II) of the Work Pass Regulations. Paragraph 7 of the
                    First Schedule contemplates that a foreign worker may be sent to work for a
                    third party engaged in the construction industry, so long as the worker
                    consents. Some flexibility is thus accorded by the Work Pass Regulations,
                    perhaps in acknowledgment of industry practices. As such, I saw nothing to
                    preclude the plaintiff from using workers obtained from its sub-contractors for
                    the purposes of the contract, which was a contract for the supply of labour. The
                    issue of whether the workers provided under the contract came directly from the
                    plaintiff or through its subcontractors could hardly amount to a <em>bona fide</em> defence enabling the defendant to evade
                    summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the final analysis, the defendant was
                    evidently clutching at straws in its attempts to conjure up a <em>bona fide</em> defence, precisely the sort of conduct that the court
                    ought to be wary of. I therefore dismissed the Appeal and fixed costs at $3,000
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
