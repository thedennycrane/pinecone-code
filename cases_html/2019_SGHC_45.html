The defendant raised the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. The defendant also took out a third party action against her solicitors, namely Tan Peng Chin LLC (“the Third Party”), for failure to explain to her and her late husband, Mr Kung Yeok Heng (“Mr Kung”) that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 22 January 2013, the defendant and Mr Kung executed the OCBC Mortgage at the Third Party’s office. Under the OCBC Mortgage, the defendant and Mr Kung had mortgaged their jointly owned property at 17 East Coast Drive, Singapore (“the Property”) and all their other assets to the plaintiff. In return, the plaintiff rendered credit facilities to King-Repa Trading (S) Pte Ltd (“the Company”) for an initial sum of US$8,500,000 million. Mr Kung was a shareholder and director of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The OCBC Mortgage was executed in the presence of Mr Wong Chung Jun (“TPW1”), who was then a solicitor employed by the Third Party. At the relevant time, the Third Party was acting for all the parties involved in the OCBC Mortgage, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff, the defendant and Mr Kung. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Under the OCBC Mortgage, the defendant and Mr Kung agreed to pay the plaintiff, on demand, all sums of moneys and liabilities due or owing to the plaintiff by the Company under the credit facilities either alone or jointly, thus the term “all-moneys mortgage”. This meant that both the defendant’s and Mr Kung’s liability to the plaintiff under the OCBC Mortgage would include all outstanding sums owed to the plaintiff by the Company above and beyond the value of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The initial credit facilities extended by the plaintiff to the Company were up to US$8,500,000 (“the Original Facilities”). Subsequently, these credit facilities were increased to US$9,800,000 on 17 December 2013 and ultimately these were raised to US$10,800,000 on 17 December 2014 (“the Revised Facilities”).

The defendant’s case is that the mortgage she intended to execute on 22 January 2013 was one in which her liability would be limited only to the Property and/or the value thereof.

The defendant and Mr Kung then signed the Letter of Confirmation to acknowledge that this had indeed been done. Finally, at the same meeting, the defendant and Mr Kung signed the Form of Confirmation and Consent to acknowledge that the OCBC Mortgage was valid and binding on them.

This is because when the defendant signed the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent, the defendant had made an unequivocal representation to the plaintiff that she understood the OCBC Mortgage and agreed to provide security for the Revised Facilities in the form of an all-moneys mortgage. The plaintiff relied on this representation and extended the Original Facilities and subsequently the Revised Facilities to the Company. When the Company defaulted and the plaintiff exercised its right of possession of the Property pursuant to the OCBC Mortgage, the defendant did not object. She acknowledged the plaintiff’s right and gave vacant possession of the Property to the plaintiff. The plaintiff submits that this showed that the defendant further acknowledged that the OCBC Mortgage was binding on her. Therefore, the defendant was bound by the OCBC Mortgage.

It is trite law that a person of full age and understanding is normally bound by his signature on a document, whether he reads or understands it or not: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015) at para 3-049. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Thus the default position is that the defendant is deemed to have understood and agreed to the obligations of the OCBC Mortgage when she signed the documents pertaining to the OCBC Mortgage. In particular, when the defendant signed the OCBC Mortgage documents she had agreed to pay to the plaintiff, on demand, all such sums of money which shall from time to time be owing or remain unpaid, including the interest accrued, to the plaintiff by the Company.

It is fundamental that the sanctity of contract or agreement must be adhered to and respected. If the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> is allowed to be invoked liberally, then anyone who is not satisfied with the contract or agreement that he has entered into will easily renege on his contractual obligations by invoking the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Given the above, the plaintiff submits that the defendant must have known the nature of the OCBC Mortgage before the meeting with TPW1 on 22 January 2013. Thus, her case that the OCBC Mortgage was radically different from what she thought she signed must fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the issue of the First Element of </span>non est factum</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(a) Is the defendant’s perceived mortgage limited to the Property radically different from the OCBC Mortgage, an all-moneys mortgage?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, I shall examine whether a mortgage on the Property which the defendant thought she had signed and an all-moneys mortgage are radically different. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar</span> found that there was a radical difference between what a signor thought she signed and the document signed. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that “the renunciation of the Appellants’ rights to be co-administrators of Father’s estate and the renunciation of the Three Siblings’ beneficial interests in the estate were completely distinct matters that bore no correlation to one another” (see <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar </span>at [121]). The guiding principle as to what is merely different as compared to what is “radically” different is to see whether what the signor thought she signed and what she actually signed were “completely distinct matters that bore no correlation to one another”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, a mortgage to secure banking facilities limited to the Property and an all-moneys mortgage to secure banking facilities are both commercial instruments dealing with the same subject matter – which is to provide security for banking facilities. Where they differ is in the extent of the mortgagor’s liability. Thus, these two mortgages, as secured security instruments, are not radically different. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, the consequences in the event of default may or may not be different depending on how much assets the mortgagor owns. In this case, if the defendant had owned only the Property then the consequences between the two types of mortgages would be the same. But if the defendant had owned the Property and many other assets and properties, then the consequences could be radically different. This must also depend on the size of the debt. In other words, the larger the debt, the bigger the difference. On the other hand, if the defendant had owned the Property and some small savings and time deposit accounts, then the consequences also would not be radically different. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Nevertheless, I am of the view that to ascertain whether the First Element of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> has been satisfied, the focus has to be on the nature or type of the perceived and actual documents rather than on the actual consequences of these documents which may or may not be radical as it will have to depend on many imponderables and the circumstances of each case as I have explained above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Hence, I am of the view that the all-moneys mortgage (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the OCBC Mortgage) and the mortgage limited to the Property as perceived by the defendant are not radically different in nature as these are different types of mortgages offered by the plaintiff to their mortgagors to secure banking facilities. Hence, the defendant has failed to establish the First Element of the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(b) Did the defendant know that she had signed an all-moneys mortgage (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the OCBC Mortgage)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On the evidence, I find that the defendant <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that she was asked to sign an all-moneys mortgage before she appended her signature on the OCBC Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(i) The 11 Jan Letter</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 With regard to the 11 Jan Letter, I find that the Third Party did mail this letter to the defendant and Mr Kung and that it reached their residence. The 11 Jan Letter is of paramount importance to the pivotal issue of whether the defendant knew that the OCBC Mortgage was an all moneys mortgage as it clearly stated that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage. I also find that either the defendant or Mr Kung must have read the 11 Jan Letter because if neither the defendant nor Mr Kung had read the 11 Jan Letter they would not know that they could arrange a meeting with TPW1 on 22 January 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The defendant does not deny receipt of the 11 Jan Letter. Her defence is that she did not read it. The defendant knows the importance of the 11 Jan Letter and that her defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum </span>will collapse if she was aware of the contents of this letter<span class="font-italic">. </span>That<span class="font-italic"> </span>was why she tried to explain that although the 11 Jan Letter was addressed to her and Mr Kung, she did not open and read it. She said that there was an understanding between her and Mr Kung that for such a letter, the latter would open and read it. In other words, she deferred to Mr Kung the 11 Jan Letter and relied on the old adage saying that “dead men tell no tales”. However, when I questioned the defendant on whether Mr Kung knew that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage she said “I don’t know whether he [knew] or not, but if he [knew] it, he would have told me”.

</div> I am unable to accept the defendant’s version of the events. I find that it is inconceivable that Mr Kung had grossly misread the 11 Jan Letter and the OCBC Mortgage when all the documents unmistakably indicated that it was an all-moneys mortgage. Mr Kung was an experienced businessman and this was not the first banking facility he was involved in for the Company which was secured by an all-moneys mortgage (see above at [11]). Both the defendant and Mr Kung knew that the OCBC Mortgage was a credit refinancing facility for the Bangkok Bank Mortgage, which was also an all-moneys mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is also important to note that Mr Kung and the Company were involved in the negotiations over the Original Facilities and the means of securing those banking facilities with the plaintiff.

</div> I find the defendant’s arguments on this point hard to accept and entirely misconceived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For one, the onus is on the defendant to prove <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum</span> and that she, with her educational qualifications and experience, could not understand the 11 Jan Letter and the OCBC Mortgage. As the plaintiff has rightly highlighted, the defendant is not an uneducated person (see above at [64]). She cannot be compared to “an elderly and poorly educated client” (see <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar</span> at [123]). She is obviously more capable than that. I also find that the language used in the 11 Jan Letter is simple and straightforward. I cannot fathom how someone who is as educated and experienced as the defendant would struggle to understand the words “[there is] no limit on the amount of [the defendant and Mr Kung’s] liabilities as owners of the Property, for the debts of [the Company] under [the OCBC Mortgage]”, or the words “[t]his means that by signing [the OCBC Mortgage] as owners, [the defendant and Mr Kung] are also personally liable for all moneys owed by [the Company] to [the plaintiff]” and the relevant paragraphs of the 11 Jan Letter (see above at [13(a)]).

First, she admitted that she did not even read the OCBC Mortgage. Second, she was careless in not taking any interest in the 11 Jan Letter. Third, she did not even read the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent when she signed them. Fourth, even if she did read them, she was nonetheless careless in not enquiring into the OCBC Mortgage which was referred to therein. Fifth, even if TPW1 did not explain the OCBC Mortgage to her, she was, nonetheless, capable of understanding the OCBC Mortgage.

</div> She also chose not to ask TPW1 any questions. The defendant was negligent and failed to exercise due care when she signed these documents. Therefore, she should be held liable for the consequences of the documents she had signed and she should not be allowed to renege on the OCBC Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In summary, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the defendant had failed to prove her defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. The OCBC Mortgage which the defendant signed was <span class="font-italic">not </span>radically different from what the defendant had thought she signed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a mortgage limited to the value of the Property. In fact, the evidence indicates that the defendant knew the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage. I also find the defendant was negligent and careless when signing the OCBC Mortgage as she had taken a perfunctory approach towards the signing of the mortgage documents. She made no effort to read the OCBC Mortgage or ask TPW1 any questions to understand the nature and terms of the OCBC Mortgage. On the evidence it appears that there was wilful blindness on the defendant’s part.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 From the foregoing, the OCBC Mortgage is not void and the plaintiff can rely on it. Thus, the defendant is liable to pay the plaintiff the outstanding sums under the Revised Facilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Is the defendant estopped from seeking an invalidation of the OCBC Mortgage?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Having already found that the defendant’s defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> has not been established and that the OCBC Mortgage is binding on the defendant, it is unnecessary for me to consider the plaintiff’s other argument of estoppel which is that the defendant is estopped from seeking an invalidation of the OCBC Mortgage even if the defendant has succeeded in its defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. However, for completeness, I shall examine the merits of the plaintiff’s argument on the principle of estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The plaintiff asserts that it relied on the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent as unequivocal representations made by the defendant to the plaintiff that the defendant understood the terms of the OCBC Mortgage and is bound by the OCBC Mortgage. In reliance on these representations, the plaintiff disbursed the moneys under the facilities to the Company to its detriment. Therefore, the plaintiff asserts that the defendant cannot now turn back on her words and seek to invalidate her obligations under the OCBC Mortgage on the grounds that she did not understand what she signed.

The duty to explain to the defendant carefully was laid down in the case of <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v </span><span class="font-italic">Etridge (No 2) </span>[2002] 2 AC 773 (“<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span>”) and in the <span class="font-italic">Code of Consumer Banking Practice</span> which outlines the minimum standards of good banking practice which customers can expect from the bank. The defendant argues that the plaintiff’s duty as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> and the <span class="font-italic">Code of Consumer Banking Practice</span> is basically to ensure that the defendant had been properly advised on her obligations under the OCBC Mortgage, especially when she was Mr Kung’s wife and had no benefit from the OCBC Mortgage. Having failed to fulfil this duty, it is, therefore, inequitable for the plaintiff to rely on the representations made by the defendant regarding her understanding and agreement to be bound by the OCBC Mortgage.

Hence, the plaintiff is liable to return to her the net sale proceeds from the sale of the Property and the moneys the plaintiff had taken from her savings account and time deposit account which the plaintiff had used to set off against the sums owed by the defendant under the OCBC Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Therefore, the issue before me is: assuming the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> had indeed been made out, is the defendant, nonetheless, estopped from seeking to invalidate her obligations to the plaintiff? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the Canadian Supreme Court case of <span class="font-italic">Prudential Trust Company Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Cugnet</span> [1956] SCR 914, the court had to consider whether estoppel can preclude a plea of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>, Locke J made the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question as to whether the respondents are entitled to rely upon the defence is raised by the plea of estoppel by conduct in the reply to the statement of defence. The basis for the contention is that Edmond Cugnet having, by his conduct, enabled Hunter and his principals to sell what appeared on the face of it to be a half interest in the mineral rights to a purchaser for value acting in good faith, he cannot dispute the validity of the instruments as against the latter. The estoppel, it is said, arises by reason of the negligence of Edmond Cugnet. The question is the same as that referred to by Buckley L.J. in <span class="font-italic">Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v Bragg </span>[1911] 1 KB 489 at 494, in the following terms: -</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There has been so much discussion during the argument as to the plea of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>, and the relevance of negligence in relation to it under the circumstances of this case, that I wish to say a few words expressing my view of the law on the subject. In an action upon a deed, the defendant may say by way of defence that it is not his deed, <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. <span class="font-italic">If it is found to be his deed, the plaintiff gets judgment and there is an end of the case. But suppose</span><span class="font-italic"> that it is found not to be his deed, and he succeeds on </span>non est factum<span class="font-italic">, the case is not necessarily over, because the plaintiff may say “True you have established that this is not in fact your deed, </span><span class="font-italic">but you are estopped by your conduct from saying that it is not your deed, and I can recover against you, although it is not your deed.” It is only in this latter case that the question of estoppel comes into action.</span> Negligence has nothing to do with the question whether the deed is in fact the deed of the defendant. Negligence has only to do with the question of estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Likewise, in this case, although the court may find that the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> has been established, that is not the end of the matter because it is still open to the plaintiff to argue that the defendant is, nonetheless, estopped from avoiding her obligations under the OCBC Mortgage. To do so, the plaintiff bears the burden to prove that estoppel has been made out and that it is in the interest of equity that the defendant is liable under the OCBC Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 To establish estoppel by representation, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5”</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [41] succinctly laid down the principles as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a representation had to be made by the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant must have actual authority with regard to the subject of the representation; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the plaintiff had acted upon the said representation to its detriment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the issue of estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The plaintiff had granted credit facilities to the Company and the defendant had provided security in respect of these credit facilities under the OCBC Mortgage.

</div> In this case, the plaintiff had engaged the Third Party to handle the execution of the OCBC Mortgage. When the plaintiff engaged an outside law firm to handle such transactions, the plaintiff would provide the outside law firm a uniform set of instructions to ensure that a comprehensive and properly standardised mortgage procedure is followed (“Instructions”).

We require your confirmation (in the form as asset out in our Report on Title) that you have advised each of the party providing security and/or support for this transaction about the nature, effect and consequences of the transaction including that the Bank is fully entitled to enforce its legal rights in accordance with the terms and conditions of the security furnished. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In other words, the plaintiff had specifically instructed the Third Party that for the execution of such mortgages, the Third Party must disclose to all the parties that it was also representing the plaintiff as well. The Third Party was then required to provide its written confirmation that it had advised all the parties concerned about the nature, effect and consequences of the transaction. The purpose of obtaining this written confirmation was to ensure that the Third Party had properly advised the relevant parties that it was also representing the plaintiff in the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I find that the above arrangement whereby a bank engaged an outside law firm to handle the execution of mortgages is entirely acceptable provided that the bank places sufficient safeguards to ensure that the mortgagor is sufficiently advised on his obligations under the mortgage. As Lord Nicholls had said in <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> at [79]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the bank is not willing to undertake the task of explaining itself, the bank must provide the solicitor with the financial information he needs for this purpose. Accordingly, it should become routine practice for banks, if relying on confirmation from a solicitor for their protection, to send to the solicitor the necessary financial information. What is required must depend on the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Based on the above arrangement, the plaintiff had relied on the Third Party to advise and explain to the defendant and Mr Kung on the OCBC Mortgage and other related documents pertaining to this transaction as required under the Instructions. The Third Party was engaged by the plaintiff to handle the execution of the OCBC Mortgage. The Third Party had also informed the defendant that it was also representing the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not present when the defendant and Mr Kung executed the OCBC Mortgage and signed the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent. Thus, the plaintiff did not deal directly with the defendant when the defendant executed the OCBC Mortgage. Hence, there was no interaction between the plaintiff and the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The only means by which the plaintiff could have known that the defendant understood the OCBC Mortgage and agreed to be bound by the obligations thereunder were the signed Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent. The Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent both stated in unequivocal terms that the defendant understood the terms of the OCBC Mortgage and that she had agreed to be liable for the obligations thereunder (see [20] to [25] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In that light, I find that there is no way for the plaintiff to know the defendant’s state of mind when the defendant executed the OCBC Mortgage and signed the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent. Thus the plaintiff would not have suspected anything was amiss, if any. Given the Instructions issued to the Third Party, it is reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the signed OCBC Mortgage, the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent as unequivocal representations by the defendant that the defendant understood and agreed to be bound by the OCBC Mortgage and that the Third Party had followed the Instructions properly. The plaintiff was one step removed from the saga which was what transpired during the execution of the OCBC Mortgage. Hence, it is inaccurate for the defendant to allege that the plaintiff knew that the defendant was not properly advised. There was no way for the plaintiff to know this. Therefore, I reject the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff had come with unclean hands.

</div>. But she submits that TPW1 should have exercised greater care in his discharge of his duty to explain to her as the defendant was the wife of Mr Kung, the director of the borrower Company and she had no beneficiary interest in the OCBC Mortgage. I shall discuss this at length below at [136] onwards. However, for the purpose of this issue it suffices for me to highlight that the defendant takes no issue with the OCBC Mortgage if the liability is limited to the Property. If this was the defendant’s case she would not have alleged that TPW1 had failed to discharge his duty diligently. Therefore, it appears that her grievance against TPW1 that he had failed to alert her that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage may have been an afterthought.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I further find that the plaintiff’s practice of issuing the Instructions to the Third Party and requiring the Third Party to furnish certain confirmations pursuant to the Instructions (see above at [118] to [120]) were sufficient safeguards for the plaintiff to ensure that the defendant and other mortgagors were sufficiently and adequately advised as to the nature and terms of the mortgage documents they  were executing. Thus, the defendant continues to be liable to the plaintiff under the OCBC Mortgage on the principle of equitable estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In the same vein, the defendant is also estopped from making her counterclaim for the return of the net sale proceeds from the sale of the Property and the moneys the plaintiff had taken from her savings account and time deposit account which the plaintiff had used to set off against the sums owed by the defendant under the OCBC Mortgage. For one, the defendant’s case is that her liabilities under the OCBC Mortgage is only up to the value of the Property. Thus, it is not open to her to seek a return of the net sale proceeds of the Property from the plaintiff. Second, the defendant is estopped from invalidating the OCBC Mortgage by virtue of the representations she had made in the Letter of Confirmation and the Form of Confirmation and Consent.

</div> The Third Party submits that it had put in place a system to ensure that mortgagors who approached them were all well-advised on the nature of the mortgage they were about to execute. This involved sending a letter of explanation first to the mortgagors – which is the 11 Jan Letter in this case. The defendant and/or Mr Kung then arranged for a meeting with the Third Party thereafter. At that meeting which was on 22 January 2013, a copy of the 11 Jan Letter was handed to the defendant and Mr Kung. The Third Party explained the nature and salient terms of the OCBC Mortgage to the defendant and Mr Kung before they executed the mortgage and signed a letter acknowledging that the Third Party had explained the mortgage to them.

</div> Thus I find that the <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> principles are not relevant in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 On the nature of the solicitor’s duties, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar</span> stated at [122]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… This was a case, instead, where a group of lay and unsophisticated clients had gone to the solicitors in the expectation that the latter were looking out for and would advise them properly as to their interests in connection with the execution of a document that formed part of a set of probate papers dealing with a somewhat complicated arrangement. This reliance on the solicitors was not at all unreasonable. Indeed, as the following oft-cited passage in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad </span><span class="font-italic">Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [68] highlights, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is in fact a natural dependency which solicitors must generally expect when they have conduct of legal matters, especially where unsophisticated or vulnerable lay clients are involved:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">T]he public rely upon lawyers for wise and effective counsel. This is especially the case when clients are particularly vulnerable. This could be due to a number or variety of reasons – or, indeed, a combination thereof. These include impecuniousness, a lack of schooling and/or language and (invariably, with the exception of legally-trained persons) a lack of legal knowledge</span>. In this last-mentioned regard, it is not merely an absence of legal knowledge. To many laypersons (even highly educated ones), the law constitutes a morass of technical – even arcane – rules. Many even fear the law when the precise opposite should be the case. … The present proceedings illustrate all the dangers that must be assiduously avoided. <span class="font-italic">Lawyers must convey what the precise legal situation is with limpid clarity, taking into consideration the fact that their clients may not always share the same language, intellectual or legal facility as them. </span>The legitimacy of law in general and of legal personnel in particular depends on this. Still less must laypersons be lulled into a false sense of security and/or into a situation of misinformation. Whenever in doubt, lawyers should clarify. <span class="font-italic">They must begin from the assumption that laypersons are more likely to rely upon them than not – if only because they are professionals schooled in the law and whose calling is therefore to advise on the law in all its various aspects. </span>They must, wherever applicable, advise laypersons to seek independent legal advice if they are unable to assist – for example, because of a possible conflict of interests. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics and emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Finally, where the solicitor is acting for multiple clients with conflicting interests, as in this case, and one of the clients enters into a transaction that prejudices her interests and benefits the conflicting interests of another client, it is incumbent on the solicitor to fully advise the client who was prejudiced as to the terms and effects of the transaction: see <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar</span> at [80].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I shall now consider whether the Third Party had discharged this duty.

</div> If the entire evidence of the Third Party rests solely on its normal practice or procedure I would be extremely cautious to accept it. However, in this case there are contemporaneous documents which are corroborative evidence to assist TPW1 to recall the events on 22 January 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The contemporaneous documents for the meeting on 22 January 2013 were the Letter of Confirmation, the Form of Confirmation and Consent, the 11 Jan Letter and the OCBC Mortgage. The Letter of Confirmation signed by the defendant and Mr Kung on the date of the meeting on 22 January 2013 is a contemporaneous record of what transpired at the meeting on 22 January 2013. The Letter of Confirmation stated that the defendant and Mr Kung acknowledged that TPW1 had explained to them their liabilities under the OCBC Mortgage. The Letter of Confirmation also informed the defendant and Mr Kung that the Third Party was also acting for the Company and the plaintiff. It stated that the defendant and Mr Kung could appoint another solicitor to advise them on the OCBC Mortgage, but they chose not to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 TPW1 admitted that he could not recall exactly what transpired at the meeting with the defendant and Mr Kung on 22 January 2013. This is understandable as it is humanly impossible to remember the details of every execution of a mortgage given the fact that TPW1 had, by then, handled some 300 banking and conveyancing files.

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Q: </span>You don’t know, fair enough. I put it to you, in fact, Mr Wong, that what happened on 22 January 2013 when Mr Kung and Mdm Yeo came to your office, all you did was put the documents before them and request them to sign. I put it to you that is the position. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">A:</span> I strongly disagree, counsel. As it stands, <span class="font-italic">it’s an insult to myself to even hear that statement.</span> Clients, there are clients appearing before me signing an all monies mortgage, it could be for any particular event, it could be a momentous event when they bought a house, it could be any other transaction matter. In this case it’s a refinancing which is something the mortgagors has done before, and again <span class="font-italic">you are suggesting that a reasonable prudent person appearing before anybody would just sign a document without being explained to, I think that is a certain level of absurdity here.</span> Then again, I say why would I – essentially the reliance is on what would have been in the usual course of events for signing an all monies mortgage. Again, as solicitors we understand that it’s also a huge undertaking which is why I’m saying that an all monies mortgage, <span class="font-italic">to the best of my ability, I’ll explain to the mortgagors the</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">terms of</span><span class="font-italic"> the all moneys mortgage, the salient terms, before they sign the all monies mortgage</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Therefore, I do not agree with the defendant’s argument that <span class="font-italic">solely</span> upon the fact that there are no attendance notes, this court must find TPW1 unworthy of credit. The credibility of a witness must depend on his testimony and be measured against the overall evidence, particularly that which is contemporaneous in nature. Looking at the evidence, I find TPW1 to be a credible and truthful witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In the light of the foregoing, when I compare the defendant’s evidence against the Third Party’s evidence, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that TPW1 did explain the nature and terms of the OCBC Mortgage – particularly that it was an all-moneys mortgage – to the defendant and Mr Kung at the meeting on 22 January 2013. There is no evidence to suggest that TPW1 was negligent when he handled the execution of the OCBC Mortgage and when he explained the nature and terms of the OCBC Mortgage to the defendant and Mr Kung.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Therefore, I find that the Third Party was not negligent in advising the defendant on the nature of the OCBC Mortgage. Logically, it follows that it is unnecessary for me to decide the apportionment of liability between the defendant and the Third Party in relation to the claim by the plaintiff against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 To summarise, I find that the defendant’s defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> has not been made out. The defendant had known that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage since receiving the 11 Jan Letter which was sent to her and Mr Kung prior to their execution of the OCBC Mortgage on 22 January 2013. Furthermore, I find that TPW1 and the Third Party were not negligent in advising the defendant and Mr Kung on the nature and terms of the OCBC Mortgage at the meeting on 22 January 2013. The defendant understood that the OCBC Mortgage was an all-moneys mortgage before she signed it on 22 January 2013. In any event, I am unable to accept that the defendant did not read or take any reasonable steps to understand the nature of the OCBC Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Even if the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> had been established, I find that the defendant is estopped from seeking to avoid her liabilities under the OCBC Mortgage. The plaintiff was not involved in the defendant’s execution of the OCBC Mortgage. The plaintiff had relied on the signed Letter of Confirmation and the signed Form of Confirmation and Consent as unequivocal representations by the defendant stating that she understood and agreed to be bound by the OCBC Mortgage. In reliance thereof, the plaintiff had disbursed the sums under the Revised Facilities to the Company to its detriment. Therefore, in the light of the circumstances of this case, the defendant should also rightly be estopped from relying on <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> to avoid her obligations towards the plaintiff under the OCBC Mortgage. In the same vein, the defendant is estopped from claiming a return of the net sale proceeds from the sale of the Property and the moneys the plaintiff had taken from her savings account and time deposit account which the plaintiff had used to set off against the sums owed by the defendant under the OCBC Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For the above reasons, I rule in favour of the plaintiff and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff. I also dismiss the defendant’s claim against the Third Party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The defendant will pay costs to the plaintiff for the main suit and the counterclaim.
