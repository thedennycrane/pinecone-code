The Applicants had paid the sum of $1,195,354.42 to the Respondent pursuant to two abortive attempts to purchase a residential property (the “Property”). Although it was undisputed that the sale had been terminated due to repeated defaults by the Applicants, the Applicants submitted that the Respondent was not entitled to retain <span class="font-italic">any</span> part of this sum.

As the Respondent had made an offer to settle that was without prejudice save as to costs, I reserved the matter of costs to the Assistant Registrar, who would be able to determine whether the net sum found payable to the Applicants after any set-off would fall below the settlement offer. I also ordered the Respondent to pay pre-judgment interest on the moneys found payable to the Applicants. The Applicants have appealed against my decision to dismiss their application, my decision that interest was to run only in respect of the net sum of money that is eventually found to be repayable to the Applicants after the assessment of damages hearing, as well as my decision to reserve the matter of costs and the applicable rate of interest to the Assistant Registrar.

Pursuant to cl 7.4(d) of SPA 1, the Respondent was entitled to forfeit and keep 20% of the purchase price (amounting to $357,000) should SPA 1 be “annulled” by the Respondent following a repudiation of the contract by the Applicants. Under cl 7.4(c) of SPA 1, the Respondent was also entitled to recover from prior payments “all interest, property tax, maintenance charges and other amounts owing and unpaid” under SPA 1 as at the date of annulment and “all costs and expenses legal or otherwise” incurred in relation to the recovery of possession of the Property.

By then, a total of $1,217,550 had already been paid by the Applicants. The Respondent said that the remaining $838,354.42 would be returned to the Applicants.

</div> In particular, the issue was whether on a proper construction of Condition 15.9(c)(i), the Respondent was entitled forfeit such sum it considered reasonable as a true deposit, namely 20% of the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Applicants submitted that the sum of $1,195,354.42, which was what the parties had defined as a “deposit” under cl 1 of OTP 2 (at [9] above), was extortionate and far in excess of the standard customary rate for deposits in such transactions, which was 20% of the purchase price. As the sum that was labelled as a “deposit” under OTP 2 amounted to approximately 63% of the purchase price, it was disproportionate to what would have been reasonably necessary to serve the function of earnest money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Applicants relied on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Polyset Ltd v Panhandat Ltd</span> [2002] 3 HKLRD 319 (“<span class="font-italic">Polyset</span>”), where it was held that the vendor was not entitled to forfeit a deposit representing 35% of the purchase price. The Applicants also referred to the framework set out in the leading case of <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong v Yip Fook Mun and another</span> [2018] 3 SLR 534 (“<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span>”). First, the Applicants submitted that the “deposit” of 63% in OTP 2 was contrary to the parties’ prior dealings, as this was a departure from the quantum of deposit stipulated under cl 7.4(d) of SPA 1, which had been the “magic number” of 20% (at [4] above). Second, the Applicants submitted that although a lengthier completion period could justify the need for a larger <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo </span>(citing <span class="font-italic">Polyset</span> at [107]), the Respondent was only required to keep the Property “off the market” for ten weeks from the exercise of OTP 2. This was in contrast to the period of nine months in <span class="font-italic">Polyset</span>, which therefore could not justify a higher quantum of deposit than was customary. The Applicants therefore submitted that the sum of $1,195,354.42 should be characterised as a part payment, the forfeiture of which was subject to the penalty rule, rather than a true deposit.

</div> According to the Applicants, interpreting the phrase “any deposit” to include any lesser part of the sum stipulated by the parties in the contract as a “deposit” would lead to arbitrariness and unacceptable uncertainty in a contracting party’s liability or obligations, as they would not be able to ascertain the maximum loss they would suffer in the event of termination.

The Applicants submitted that the power of forfeiture under Condition 15.9(c)(i) was limited only to deposits which have been determined to be true deposits as a matter of law. According to the Applicants, no power to forfeit arose at all once the court determines that the sum is not a true deposit. On the premise that the sum of $1,195,354.42 was in fact a part payment, the Applicants submitted that the Respondent could have no recourse to Condition 15.9(c)(i) as the sum fell entirely outside its scope of operation. The key difference between this submission and the Applicants’ earlier submission, was that the Respondent could not rely on Condition 15.9(c)(i) at all.

It was undisputed that the Applicants had failed to comply with an effective notice to complete. The Respondent was therefore expressly empowered to “forfeit and keep any deposit paid” by the Applicants under Condition 15.9(c)(i) (at [10] above). The Respondent submitted that the effect of the words “may” and “any” in Condition 15.9(c)(i) was that its power to forfeit was <span class="font-italic">not</span> limited to forfeiture of the <span class="font-italic">entire </span><span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of “deposit” as defined in OTP 2, but instead vested the Respondent with the discretion to forfeit such lesser sum it considered reasonable. The language of Condition 15.9(c)(i) was wide enough to encompass the forfeiture of a lesser sum and could be distinguished from the type of forfeiture clauses which provide that “<span class="font-italic">the</span> deposit shall be forfeited”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Respondent submitted that it had in fact only forfeited the sum of $380,000, which amounted to 20% of the purchase price of $1,900,000, and never purported to forfeit the sum of $1,195,354.42. The amount actually forfeited was entirely consistent with the parties’ prior dealings under SPA 1. Furthermore, the court should prefer an interpretation that upholds the validity of a clause over an interpretation that would render the clause invalid. The Respondent also highlighted that the Applicants had a history of serial defaults prior to OTP 2 and were unquestionably aware that the Respondent could and would forfeit reasonable deposits given what had transpired following the termination of SPA 1. The Respondent had only granted OTP 2 at the repeated request of the Applicants, who had portrayed themselves as sincere and genuine purchasers. As a result of the Applicants’ repeated breaches, the Property had been kept “off the market” for approximately three years (5 December 2015 to 20 November 2018), and the Respondent only managed to complete the sale of the Property in April 2021 after spending substantial time and resources to find a substitute purchaser, some five years after the grant of OTP 1. The Applicants had also delayed by waiting four and a half years before making their formal demand on 21 March 2023. Accordingly, the Respondent submitted that the forfeiture of the sum of $380,000 was reasonable as a true deposit.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Law on deposits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The law allows for the forfeiture of <span class="font-italic">true</span> deposits. Both parties agreed that <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> sets out the proper approach to the forfeiture of a contractual deposit. The framework may be summarised as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [140] and [143]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court must determine whether the vendor had an express or inferred power to forfeit on a proper construction of the contract. That a sum was intended to be paid as a deposit usually leads to the inference that there was the power to forfeit. If there was no power to forfeit, the sum must generally be returned subject to any right of set-off for damages.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if there was a power to forfeit, the court must determine whether the sum is a <span class="font-italic">true</span> deposit. A true deposit is a sum that is reasonable as an earnest or is customary or moderate. It need not be a genuine pre-estimate of loss and may be forfeited regardless of its proportionality or relation to any actual loss occasioned. The touchstone of reasonableness looks at whether the sum is “so large that it cannot be objectively justified by reference to the functions which such a deposit properly serves”, assessed in the specific context of the facts of each case. The court may have regard to any factors relevant to the effectiveness of the true deposit as an earnest of performance.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, even if the sum is larger than the customary amount for the type of transaction in question (if such a convention is discernible), the vendor may show “special circumstances” to justify that amount. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, if the sum is reasonable or otherwise justifiable, it may be forfeited as a true deposit. Forfeiture of a true deposit is subject only to relief against forfeiture (if available) and cannot be regarded as a penalty. If the sum is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a true deposit, it will be characterised as a part payment. The contractual power to forfeit remains exercisable subject to the penalty rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 A useful starting position in understanding the law on deposits is the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in the Privy Council case of <span class="font-italic">Workers Trust &amp; Merchant Bank Ltd v Dojap Investments Ltd</span> [1993] AC 573 (“<span class="font-italic">Workers Trust</span>”) at 578D–578G:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In general, a contractual provision which requires one party in the event of his breach of the contract to pay or forfeit a sum of money to the other party is unlawful as being a penalty, unless such provision can be justified as being a payment of liquidated damages being a genuine pre-estimate of the loss which the innocent party will incur by reason of the breach. <span class="font-italic">One exception to this general rule is the provision for the payment of a deposit by the purchaser on a contract for the sale of land</span>. Ancient law has established that the forfeiture of such a deposit … does not fall within the general rule and <span class="font-italic">can be validly forfeited even though the amount of the deposit bears no reference to the anticipated loss to the vendor flowing from the breach of contract</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The special treatment afforded to such a deposit derives from the ancient custom of providing an earnest for the performance of a contract in the form of giving either some physical token of earnest (such as a ring) or earnest money … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The effect of this is that a deposit is forfeitable even if it exceeds the amount of loss actually arising or anticipated to arise from the breach. Bokhary PJ expounded upon this distinction in <span class="font-italic">Polyset</span> (at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Provided that what the vendor takes as a deposit is within the bounds of an earnest of performance, it will constitute a true deposit. As such, it will be forfeited to the vendor if the purchaser wrongfully fails to perform his part of the bargain. <span class="font-italic">This is so even if the vendor’s loss is less than the deposit. It is so even if the vendor suffers no loss at all. Indeed, it is so even if the vendor makes a profit by selling the property to someone else at a higher price. </span>If the vendor’s loss exceeds the deposit, he is of course entitled to recover the full extent of his loss, giving credit for the deposit forfeited to him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Unlike liquidated damages, which are intended to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss, the primary purpose of a deposit is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to <span class="font-italic">compensate</span> for anticipated damages. Instead, a deposit serves the dual purpose of <span class="font-italic">signalling</span> the good faith commitment of a purchaser and of <span class="font-italic">securing</span> the due performance of the contract. It dissuades purchasers who lack earnest. This is why it is said that disallowing forfeiture would enable the defaulting purchaser to escape from the bargain struck by the parties and thereby “take advantage of his own wrong” (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [49] and [124]–[127]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, to avoid the circumvention of the penalty rule, the parties’ designation of a sum as a “deposit” cannot be conclusive (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [130]). While the fact that the parties have defined or stipulated that a sum in a contract is a “deposit” will be relevant to the determination of whether there is an inferred <span class="font-italic">power</span> <span class="font-italic">to forfeit</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [30(a)] above), the validity of the forfeiture itself engages a different inquiry. To be a forfeitable true deposit, the sum must satisfy the touchstone of reasonableness. The sum must not be so large that it cannot be objectively justified by what is reasonably necessary to serve effectively as earnest moneys. This is not the same as asking whether the sum is a genuine pre-estimate of loss. In <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong </span>at [143(d)], Kannan Ramesh J (as he then was) said: “Ultimately, the question of reasonableness is one for the court to assess on the facts of each case”. Some relevant factors include the history of dealing between the parties, their financial means, the degree of commitment required on the part of the vendor to keep the property “off the market” for the duration of the sale in light of the prevailing market conditions (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [143(d)]; <span class="font-italic">Polyset</span> at [102]–[107]), and the circumstances in which the figure was derived (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">TG Master Pte Ltd v Tung Kee Development (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2022] SGHC 316 at [97]). In addition, I also considered the parties’ relative bargaining power to be another relevant factor. This factor, while not explicitly mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong </span>or <span class="font-italic">Polyset</span>, is consistent with the character of the non-exhaustive factors mentioned by Ramesh J. Taking into account the relative bargaining power of the parties is also consistent with established contractual principles (see, for example, in the context of the penalty rule, <span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2021] 1 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Denka</span>”) at [173] and <span class="font-italic">Polyset </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[103]-[104]). In short, the context will be key.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As for the interaction between the law on deposits and the penalty rule, I agreed with the view of Kannan Ramesh J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> (at [123]) that the penalty rule does not apply to true deposits. This is so especially in light of the Court of Appeal’s reaffirmation in <span class="font-italic">Denka </span>at [152] that the penalty rule is directed at secondary obligations which purport to be, but are not, a genuine pre-estimate of loss. As set out in the <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> framework (at [30] above), if the sum is found to be forfeitable as a true deposit, no question of penalty will arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, if the sum is far in excess of what would be reasonably necessary to serve effectively as earnest moneys, the sum will be characterised as a part payment. This does not automatically entitle the purchaser to claim for the return of the part payment where the vendor has an express contractual power to forfeit. To avoid forfeiture in the case of an express forfeiture clause, the purchaser must go on to show that the forfeiture clause falls foul of the penalty rule (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [136] and [140]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Respondent had the power to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The parties’ respective submissions began from different focal points. While the Applicants focused their analysis on the sum that was <span class="font-italic">defined</span> as a “deposit” in cl 1 of OTP 2, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sum of $1,195,354.42, the Respondent focused on the sum that was <span class="font-italic">actually</span> forfeited, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sum of $380,000. Notably, the Respondent did not at any point assert that forfeiture of the sum of $1,195,354.42, amounting to 63% of the purchase price, would be customary or moderate as an earnest. In my view, the determinative question was hence whether the Respondent was entitled to forfeit $380,000 (amounting to 20% of the purchase price under OTP 2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 pursuant to Condition 15.9(c)(i). Prior to the Applicants’ further submissions (at [27] above), it was undisputed that Condition 15.9(c)(i) was potentially applicable. In my view, as it was undisputed that OTP 2 had been terminated following an effective notice to complete, the Respondent had the contractual power under Condition 15.9(c)(i) to “forfeit and keep any deposit paid” by the Applicants, “without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to [the Respondent] at law or in equity” (at [10] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As the Conditions do not set out a definition for “deposit”, the power to forfeit in Condition 15.9(c)(i) must be construed together with cl 1 of OTP 2, which defined “deposit” to mean the sum of $1,195,354.42 (at [9] above). The parties’ submissions diverged on whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) entitled the Respondent to forfeit $380,000 as a true deposit, being a lesser part of this designated “deposit”, or whether it restricted the Respondent to forfeiture of only the entire quantum. As noted, the Respondent did not take the position that it was forfeiting the entire sum of $1,195,354.42, either prior to the commencement of proceedings or in its written and oral submissions. Furthermore, while both parties agreed that the operation of the penalty rule on a contractual clause was all or nothing, no such limitation was imposed in the case of true deposits. The parties therefore agreed that the primary issue was the proper construction of Condition 15.9(c)(i).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On a plain reading of Condition 15.9(c)(i), I agreed with the Respondent that the phrase “<span class="font-italic">any</span> deposit” supported an interpretation of Condition 15.9(c)(i) that entitled the Respondent the discretion to forfeit a lesser part of the sum that was designated as a “deposit” in OTP 2.

</div> Indeed, the Applicants were unable to explain how their proposed interpretation could be workable in a case where the purchaser defaults on its contractual obligations and fails to make full payment of the amount stipulated under the contract as a “deposit”. The Respondent had raised as an illustrative example a case where a purchaser paid only 5% of the purchase price towards a deposit, in breach of their obligation to furnish the stipulated amount of 20% of the purchase price. When asked whether this breach by the purchaser would disentitle the vendor from forfeiting any lesser amount, such as the 5% that was actually paid by the purchaser, the Applicants only suggested that such a situation would be “highly unusual” and ultimately agreed that the vendor <span class="font-italic">would</span> be entitled to keep such lesser part of the stipulated “deposit” that was actually received.

</div>
</div> To construe Condition 15.9(c)(i) in the way contended by the Applicants would have led to an absurd result in such situations. More fundamentally, a defaulting purchaser would be able to avoid the agreed upon consequences of their breach by relying upon their own wrongful conduct, defeating the purpose of a deposit as a security for performance. Given the breadth of the phrase “<span class="font-italic">any</span> deposit”, I could not accept the Applicants’ submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I also did not accept the Applicants’ submission that arbitrariness and uncertainty would result from the Respondent’s interpretation of Condition 15.9(c)(i). The conditions for the Applicants’ liability to arise under Condition 15.9(c)(i) were wholly unambiguous: the Applicants would be liable should they fail to comply with an effective notice to complete served by the Respondent. The ceiling of the Applicants’ liability was also certain: the Respondent could not purport to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i) any sum <span class="font-italic">greater </span>than the sum stipulated as the “deposit”. In coming to this conclusion, I also considered the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Goh Liang Yong Jonah and another v Heng Kuek Hoy and another</span> [2013] SGHC 203 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Liang Yong Jonah</span>”), which was cited by the Applicants. There, the court opined that a clause that was materially identical to Condition 15.9(c)(i) could be construed to envisage and encompass the payment of <span class="font-italic">further </span>deposits in addition to what had been stipulated as a “deposit” by the parties under the contract. The analysis ultimately depended upon what the parties had agreed between themselves (<span class="font-italic">Goh Liang Yong Jonah</span> at [33]). While not directly relevant to the issue at hand, in my view, <span class="font-italic">Goh Liang Yong Jonah</span>, only further exemplified the wide drafting of Condition 15.9(c)(i). It did not support the Applicants’ proposition that the Respondent could only forfeit <span class="font-italic">the entirety</span> of such amount stipulated as a “deposit” under the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I also did not accept the Applicants’ alternative interpretation of Condition 15.9(c)(i), which they made in their further submissions (at [27] above), that the power of forfeiture under Condition 15.9(c)(i) was limited only to deposits which have been determined to be true deposits as a matter of law. This submission was premised on the sum of $1,195,354.42 being characterised as a part payment, as the starting point of analysis. However, this ignored the plain language of Condition 15.9(c)(i), which refers to “any” deposit. As set out above, this allowed the Respondent to forfeit <span class="font-italic">part</span> of the $1,195,354.42 (that was labelled as a “deposit” in OTP 2). The Applicants’ alternative submission inverted the <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> framework (at [30] above) by bringing forward the true deposit analysis and presupposed a finding in their favour. However, the first step of the analysis was to determine whether a contractual power to forfeit existed, and if so, the scope of that power. It is only thereafter that the court would analyse whether the sum was a true deposit, which goes to the determination of whether the forfeiture was valid (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [143]).<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>The Respondent sought to forfeit $380,000.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>I had found that this would fall within the scope of their power to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i).<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>If this sum was a true deposit, the right to forfeit would have been validly exercised, subject to relief against forfeiture where available (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [140]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The forfeited sum was a true deposit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having decided that the Respondent had the power to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i), the next step was to determine whether the forfeited sum was a true deposit. I held that the sum of $380,000 had been validly forfeited as a true deposit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 This was in light of the parties’ agreement that 20% of the purchase price was the “magic number” (at [21] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In addition, I was also satisfied that the forfeited sum of $380,000 met the touchstone of reasonableness on the facts of this case. This sum was <span class="font-italic">not</span> so large that it could not be objectively justified by what was reasonably necessary to serve effectively as earnest moneys. On the contrary, I found that it was amply justified. Indeed, in my view, to disallow forfeiture in the circumstances of this case would be to allow the Applicants to take advantage of their own wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, it was undisputed that the Applicants had repeatedly breached their obligations under both SPA 1 and OTP 2, despite repeated reminders from the Respondent. It was therefore reasonable for the Respondent to require some assurance of the Applicants’ earnestness. It was undisputed that the Respondent was an innocent party and had in fact granted the Applicants multiple extensions of time notwithstanding the Applicants’ repeated failure to complete. The Respondent was not obliged to do this and had extended this courtesy after repeated pleas by the Applicants, who had claimed to be genuine and sincere purchasers. The Applicants had also procured the grant of OTP 2 on this basis. Nevertheless, the Applicants still failed to complete OTP 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, the quantum of 20% of the purchase price was reasonable given the contractual rights that had accrued to the Respondent. After the termination of SPA 1, it was undisputed that the Respondent had validly forfeited the $357,000 deposit paid under that contract. The Respondent had <span class="font-italic">only</span> agreed to credit this sum towards the option fee payable for OTP 2 after the Applicants had pleaded for a second chance to purchase the Property. This was explicitly recorded in the preamble to OTP 2 (at [7] above). Furthermore, as a matter of law, I noted that the Respondent was absolutely entitled to the $357,000 as that sum had been paid as consideration <span class="font-italic">for the grant</span> of OTP 2 itself, as explicitly set out in cl A of OTP 2 (at [7] above (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Aqua Art Pte Ltd v Goodman Development (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 865 at [34])). The Applicants were, therefore, <span class="font-italic">not</span> in any event entitled to demand the return of the full sum of $1,195,354.42. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 More importantly, the sum of $380,000, representing 20% of the purchase price under OTP 2, was consistent with the parties’ course of dealing under SPA 1, where the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $357,000 pursuant to cl 7.4(d) of SPA 1, being 20% of the purchase price under SPA 1. I thus agreed with the Respondent that the Applicants had to have known and agreed that 20% of the purchase price represented a reasonable sum that could be forfeited as a true deposit. The Applicants never contended that forfeiture of the $357,000 deposit under SPA 1 would have been improper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Third, it was undisputed that both parties were legally represented and had engaged in “fairly extensive negotiations” leading up to the conclusion of OTP 2.

</div>
</div>
</div> It was also clear from the evidence, in particular the correspondence between the parties (at [6] above), that the sum of $1,195,354.42 was intended (in a <span class="font-italic">literal</span> sense) to be earnest money to demonstrate the Applicants’ commitment to the purchase and to prove that they were sincere and genuine, notwithstanding their failure to complete SPA 1. It was in this context that OTP 2 had been drafted and granted. The circumstances showed that the Applicants were not an unadvised and ignorant party, but had instead negotiated for OTP 2, which was bespoke in comparison to SPA 1. As neither party contended that the sum of $1,195,354.42 constituted a true deposit in law, I expressed no view on that point. It sufficed for present purposes that, having put up the money to signal their commitment to the purchase of the Property, the Applicants could not contend that forfeiture of $380,000, being a lesser part of that sum, was unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I therefore held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit under Condition 15.9(c)(i) the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) was a penalty </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As stated, under the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span>, the penalty rule would not be applicable if the forfeiture was of a true deposit. As I had found that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit, the issue of whether Condition 15.9(c)(i) was a penalty became academic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, I did not accept the Applicants’ alternative argument, which emerged in their further submissions, that Condition 15.9(c)(i) would have been subject to the penalty rule <span class="font-italic">regardless</span> of whether the Respondent was entitled to forfeit a true deposit.

In <span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span>, it was held at [143(b)] that if the sum was never intended to be forfeitable on a proper construction of the contract, it must be returned subject to a right of set-off for damages. The Court of Appeal also held in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Rim Investments </span>at [35]–[38] that there may an equitable right of set-off, if such right was not expressly excluded by contract and equitable considerations supported such an exercise. In this case, Condition 15.9(c)(i) did not expressly exclude equitable set-off and instead expressly preserved rights or remedies available to the Respondent at law or in equity. The Respondent had a valid counterclaim as it was undisputed that the Applicants had breached OTP 2. The claims asserted by the Respondent arose from the same transaction and were closely linked to the Applicants’ claim. I thus found that the Respondent was entitled to the self-help remedy of set-off. However, the Respondent must adduce sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims. Unlike the claim in <span class="font-italic">Mannepalli Gayatri Ram</span>, which had been fully ventilated, there was further evidence to be adduced and tested in court.

</div>
</div> In the context of disputes over deposits, the court may allow the retention of a sum against which a claim for damages may be set-off (<span class="font-italic">Hon Chin Kong</span> at [107(c)] and [143(b)]). In <span class="font-italic">Workers Trust</span>, the Privy Council allowed the retention of a fund from which damages could be claimed because it appeared that the vendor “may have suffered some damage as a result of the purchaser's failure to complete” (at 582H–583A). Here, although I found the evidence of damages at the hearing somewhat tentative, I was likewise satisfied that the Respondent should be allowed to retain the sum of $326,243.07 pending the conclusion of the assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Applicants were entitled to interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The final issue was whether the Applicants were entitled to interest. As I have held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit, the Applicants were not entitled to any interest on that sum. The issue of interest thus arose only in relation to two sums. First, the sum of $488,957.04 that had been repaid to the Applicants on 19 April 2023. Second, the sum of $326,243.07 that was retained by the Respondent pending the conclusion of the assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Applicants submitted that they were entitled to interest on the entire sum of $1,195,354.42 at a rate of 5.33% per annum, with interest running from the date that OTP 2 was terminated, 20 November 2018, until the date of repayment. Of this total, interest on the sum of $488,957.04 was to run from 20 November 2018 to 19 April 2023, and interest on the balance moneys in the hands of the Respondent was to run until the date of full repayment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Applicants sought to be compensated by way of interest, on the basis that they had been wrongly held out of money to which they were entitled. Relying on the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1308 (“<span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products</span>”) at [138], the Applicants submitted that interest should be awarded for the period starting from the date of their entitlement to the money until the date the money was repaid. The Applicants submitted that they were entitled to pre-judgment interest during the period starting from the date the cause of action arose to the date of judgment pursuant to s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act. The Applicants also argued that they had not been dilatory in bringing these proceedings, as they had written letters of appeal to the Respondent from 1 March 2019 (at [13] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for the rate of interest, the Applicants submitted that the rate of 5.33% per annum should be applied.

Pre-judgment interest serves to compensate a successful claimant for the time value of money, the use of which was lost between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. In other words, pre-judgment interest recognises that the claimant had been wrongfully kept out of moneys by the defendant, who had enjoyed the use of it during that period. However, a claimant is not entitled to interest as of right, and the court is entitled to exercise its discretion in the manner best able to achieve justice in the circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, interest would generally be awarded if the claimant succeeds at proving that it had been wrongly held out of money to which it was entitled (<span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products </span>at [137]–[138] and [142]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products</span>, the Court of Appeal identified a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court could consider in the exercise of its discretion (at [140]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) in the absence of a prescribed rate, what rate of interest would be appropriate to the relevant period(s); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the claimant was dilatory in the bringing and conduct of the proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the claimant had received compensation for the loss suffered from a source other than the defendant; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) whether the claimant had sought and been awarded damages which include damages for the loss of the use of money; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) whether the debt is paid immediately after proceedings are commenced; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) whether the parties have agreed that pre-judgment interest should not be recoverable.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my judgment, interest must be awarded on the sum of $488,957.04. The Respondent did not dispute that it was not entitled to this sum and had in fact already returned it to the Applicants on 19 April 2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Interest must also be paid on the <span class="font-italic">net</span> sum found payable to the Applicants out of the retained sum of $326,243.07, if any, after the conclusion of the assessment of damages. In line with the rationale and purpose of pre-judgment interest, the Applicants are <span class="font-italic">only</span> entitled to be compensated interest on such sum that is found to have belonged to them (in other words, moneys the Respondent ought not to have claimed as set-off). If the Respondent is found to have properly set-off the entire sum of $326,243.07, the Respondent is entitled to retain that entire sum and the Applicants cannot be said to have been wrongfully kept out of use of the moneys. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I did not accept the Respondent’s submission that no interest should be awarded on any sum found payable to the Applicants. First, it was the Respondent who had not been ready to fully substantiate their claim for expenses with sufficient evidence at the time of the hearing and it was the Respondent who had asked for the assessment of damages. Second, the onus is now on the Respondent to make the application for an assessment of damages. Hence, the Respondent ought to bear the cost of keeping the Applicants out of use of money that the Applicants are entitled to, in the form of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The next issue was the period for which interest was to accrue, which was similarly a matter of discretion. Although any interest awarded should generally run from the date the loss accrued, the court retains a wide discretion to award interest from a later date, such as where there has been an unjustifiable delay on the part of the claimant in bringing the claim (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Crescendas Bionics Pte Ltd v Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd and other appeals</span> [2023] 1 SLR 536 at [219]). The discretion to determine the appropriate period to award pre-judgment interest is also found in s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the recovery of any debt or damages, the court <span class="font-italic">may</span>, <span class="font-italic">if it thinks fit</span>, order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the debt or damages for the whole or <span class="font-italic">any part of the period</span> <span class="font-italic">between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Accordingly, the general approach of awarding interest from the date the loss accrued is only the default starting point that represents the <span class="font-italic">maximum</span> period for which pre-judgment interest may be awarded (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I did not accept the Respondent’s submissions on the starting date for the interest period. Although I accepted the force behind their submission that a demand for the return of the deposit had to be sufficiently clear, I did not accept their submission that such clarity could only be found in the form of a formal letter of demand from a party’s solicitors. The Respondent had submitted that interest should only accrue from 21 March 2023, the date of the formal letter of demand issued by the Applicants’ solicitors. While the correspondence from the Applicants, which had been drafted by their solicitors, had used language such as “appeal and entreat” and not the language of a formal demand, the Applicants had nevertheless made clear that they were asking the Respondent to refund “the money of SGD$1,195,354.42 that [the Applicants] had paid todate [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” (at [13] above). It was hence sufficiently clear that the Applicants were asking for the return of the deposit in this letter. Not all purchasers may be able to avail themselves of the services of legal counsel. As a matter of general principle, the form of the demand or the use of specific language cannot be determinative, provided that there is sufficient clarity in what the purchaser is seeking. In my view, the Applicants had made it sufficiently clear in their letter dated 1 March 2019 that they were seeking the return of the sum of $1,195,354.42. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I thus awarded interest on the sum of $488,957.04, for the period starting on 2 March 2019 to 18 April 2023. As for any sum found payable to the Applicants after the conclusion of the assessment of damages, I awarded interest on such sum to be calculated from 2 March 2019 to the date of payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In relation to the applicable rate of interest, the Applicants had relied upon <span class="font-italic">Noor Azlin </span>in support of their submission that the rate of 5.33% per annum should be applied. I noted that the court in <span class="font-italic">Noor Azlin</span> had reached its conclusion in that case because of the lack of any explanation for why a different rate of interest was justified (<span class="font-italic">Noor Azlin </span>at [222]). In this case, the Respondent had contended that it could not have earned interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the retained sums and was seeking to prove its actual annual income rate. This would more properly reflect the consequences of being kept out of use of the money. I considered it fair to allow the Respondent the opportunity to develop its stance on the appropriate rate of interest at the assessment of damages, bearing in mind that no substantive submissions had yet been made on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To conclude, I held that the Respondent was entitled to forfeit the sum of $380,000 as a true deposit. The Respondent is to apply for an assessment of damages to determine the amount it may set-off against the retained sum of $326,243.07. The rate of interest to be applied to the repaid sum of $488,957.04 as well as for any sum determined to be payable to the Applicants after the set-off is also to be determined at the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Respondent had submitted that the issue of costs of the hearing may be affected by the eventual orders made at the assessment of damages, in light of a without prejudice letter, and asked that it be decided by the Assistant Registrar hearing the assessment of damages. I accepted this submission and made no order on costs, reserving it to the Assistant Registrar hearing the assessment. As for the hearing of further arguments, I fixed costs in favour of the Respondent at $9,000, including disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sara Ng Qian Hui and Benaiah Lim Oon Kuan (Covenant Chambers LLC) for the applicants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tay Yong Seng and Toh Jia Jing Vivian (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
