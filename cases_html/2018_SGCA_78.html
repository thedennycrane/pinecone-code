In order to warrant appellate intervention, the trial judge’s decision must be shown to be clearly inequitable or wrong in principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The present case is one where appellate intervention is necessitated by several computational errors and omissions by the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) to consider issues which, though raised by the parties, were not actively pursued during the oral hearings. It is unfortunate that the Judge did not receive adequate assistance from counsel, and that despite the Judge’s directions, counsel did not clearly set out their positions on several issues which arose in the course of the proceedings. As a result, various points which would otherwise have had a significant influence on the ultimate division of the matrimonial assets were overlooked. The difficulties are further compounded by the fact that by the time the appeals came before us, both parties had engaged new sets of counsel who were not in a position to fully explain why certain admissions, concessions and omissions were made in the court below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This case thus underscores the need for counsel to do their part to assist the court in achieving a just outcome in each case. Particularly in complicated matrimonial litigation where there are myriad issues pertaining to the accounting and valuation of assets, counsel have a crucial role to play in apprising the court of their clients’ positions and the supporting evidence on all key issues. Where multiple rounds of submissions and affidavits have been filed, and the parties’ respective positions may have evolved over the course of the hearing, counsel should, at the appropriate time, update the court of any changes in their clients’ positions. This includes informing the court of the points which remain live issues between the parties, and the points which have been abandoned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The parties were married on 10 October 2001. The wife (“the Wife”) is 42 years old and is a homemaker. The husband (“the Husband”) is 53 years old and works as a business consultant.

</div> In summary, the Judge made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With regard to custody, control, and care of the Sons, the parties had agreed to share joint custody, with the Wife having care and control and the Husband having reasonable access (Oral Judgment at [3]–[4]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With regard to the division of matrimonial assets, after taking into account the assets which were found to be in the possession of the respective parties, the Husband was to pay the Wife a sum of S$18,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) With regard to maintenance, there would be no maintenance for the Wife. As for the Sons, the Husband was to pay monthly maintenance of S$3,500 for each child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The orders with regard to the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance are the subject of these appeals. We thus set out the relevant parts of the Judge’s reasoning in more detail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s decision as to division of the matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Judge noted that the parties had “broadly agree[d] on the identity and quantum of the assets and liabilities that constitute the pool of matrimonial assets, as set out in their Joint Summary of Relevant Information [(“JSRI”)]” (Oral Judgment at [5]). These included two properties in Singapore (namely, “the Sea Breeze Property” and “the Telok Kurau Property”), several bank accounts and securities accounts, CPF monies, an insurance policy, and a car. However, the parties disagreed over the value of seven categories of assets, six of which were in the name of the Husband and one of which was in the name of the Wife (Oral Judgment at [6]). The Judge’s findings on the six categories of assets in the Husband’s name have not been challenged on appeal and it is unnecessary to discuss them in any detail. On the other hand, both parties have appealed against the Judge’s findings in relation to the category of assets in the Wife’s name: namely, bonds which the Judge found to be worth S$11,000,000 (“the Bonds”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In this regard, the Judge noted that the Wife had admitted through her counsel to receiving bonds worth “at least” S$11,000,000 from the Husband between June 2008 and November 2011. As to what had become of these Bonds or the proceeds from the liquidation or maturity of these Bonds, the Wife took the position that she had “used up” S$11,000,000 on the expenses of the household after the Husband left the family in 2008. These expenses included the following (Oral Judgment at [29]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Wife’s alleged expenditure of S$55,320 per month on herself, S$25,000 per month on the Sons, and S$13,500 per month for the rental of the Amber Apartment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Wife’s expenditure on the Husband’s mother and his two daughters, as well as the upkeep of the Sea Breeze Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 With regard to the amounts referred to at [10(a)] above, the Judge found that the individual items of expenditure which the Wife used to substantiate her expenditure were “grossly excessive” (Oral Judgment at [32]). According to the Wife, a transfer of S$1,529,040 which she received from the Husband on 31 October 2011 was reimbursement for expenses she incurred on behalf of the family from 2008 to 2011. Using this figure, the Judge estimated that the Wife had a total monthly expenditure of about S$33,979 (this being S$1,529,040 divided by 45 months from January 2008 to October 2011). The Judge then added to this figure a further sum of S$13,500 in monthly rental for the Amber Apartment. The Judge further found that the Wife was spending additional sums of about S$7,500 per month on the Husband’s mother and daughters, as well as the upkeep of the Sea Breeze Properties since January 2008. Based on these findings, the Judge concluded that the Wife would have spent about S$5,690,043 since 2008 (Oral Judgment at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 However, the Judge reasoned that this estimate was “overly generous” because the Bonds, which were of significant value, would have generated interest income or investment returns which the Wife should account for (Oral Judgment at [33]). Taking this into consideration, the Judge found that only about S$4,500,000 could be accounted for as the Wife’s expenditure on herself and the family. This meant that S$6,500,000 was unaccounted for out of the S$11,000,000 worth of Bonds that the Wife had admitted to receiving from the Husband (Oral Judgment at [34]). This amount was taken as assets remaining in the Wife’s possession (Oral Judgment at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Judge also addressed several other issues, such as alleged liabilities which were disputed between the parties, which are not the subject of these appeals. Having dealt with those points, the Judge set out her conclusions on the matrimonial assets within the pool and their respective values in tabular form (“the Table”) as follows (Oral Judgment at

S$15,641,875, the Judge turned to address the appropriate proportions for division. As this was a single income marriage, the Judge did not apply the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”). Instead, she noted that this was a marriage of moderate length, and that the Wife’s indirect contributions were significant, given that the Husband had been living in China for many years, leaving the Wife to care for the Sons and the Husband’s other family members in Singapore. She noted that the trend in cases with similar facts was towards equal division, reflecting the ideology that marriage was an equal partnership of different efforts (Oral Judgment at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Applying an equal division of the matrimonial assets, each party was to receive assets worth S$7,820,938. The Judge noted that while the Wife had declared assets worth S$1,303,226 in her own name, she had not accounted for some S$6,500,000 worth of the Bonds which were also in her name. Thus, the Wife had a total of S$7,803,226 worth of assets. To make up the difference between this and the Wife’s proportional share of S$7,820,938, a sum of S$17,712 was due to the Wife from the pool. Rounding this figure up, the Judge ordered the Husband to transfer S$18,000 to the Wife (Oral Judgment at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s decision as to maintenance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge found that since the Wife had at least S$7,820,938 worth of assets in her possession, the Wife did not require maintenance for herself. If she managed the assets well, they should generate sufficient income for her future maintenance. She therefore declined to order maintenance for the Wife (Oral Judgment at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As for the Sons, the Judge found that taking into account their ages and the Husband’s financial resources, the Husband should pay a monthly sum of S$3,500 for each son.

In her written submissions, the Wife initially also argued that the Judge erred in ordering an equal division of the matrimonial assets. She asserted that she should be entitled to “at least 60%” of the total pool.

We further note that when the Judge delivered her decision on 13 November 2017, neither party mentioned that she had made these computational errors.

Again, we would underscore the importance of counsel providing suitable assistance to the court in complicated matrimonial litigation; and this includes complying with the court’s directions on how relevant information should be presented.

</div> However, the submissions do not flesh out the precise estoppel which is being invoked, or how it may have arisen. There is no merit in this estoppel argument, not least because we cannot see any reliance placed by the Husband on the Wife’s former counsel’s concession. There is no suggestion that in reliance on the concession, the Husband elected not to adduce evidence or make any argument which he might otherwise have made if he knew that the Wife would dispute having received S$11,000,000 worth of the Bonds. It bears mention that the unfortunate concession was made at a relatively late stage of the proceedings – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">during</span> oral arguments at a hearing on 14 July 2017. There is nothing to suggest that the Husband’s then-counsel was expecting the concession by the Wife’s counsel.  It follows that up to this stage, the parties would have prepared their arguments and evidence with respect to the value of the Bonds without reference to, or reliance on, any such concession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There is, strictly speaking, no legal impediment against an appellant raising new points on appeal, even if those points contradict its pleaded case (<span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 76 (“<span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical</span>”) at [36]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In our judgment, the conclusion to be drawn from the various transactions is that out of the US$2,500,000 in proceeds which the Wife obtained from the DBS Bonds, she has satisfactorily accounted for US$1,000,000 as an amount which she used to pay off the parties’ existing loan through Joint Account Y. It may well be that it is not possible to conclude, at least on the evidence before us, that the proceeds which she received from the DBS Bonds were directly applied towards repayment of the US$1,800,000 loan, but this does not affect our finding. After all, cash is fungible. Cast another way, the Wife could have listed this US$1,000,000 as an “expense” incurred by her towards loan repayment, alongside her personal expenditure and expenditure on the Sons and the household, and the result would have been no different. On either view, US$1,000,000 ought to be deducted from the value of the Bonds which were found to be in her possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For completeness, there is nothing to suggest that the US$1,000,000 which the Wife transferred from her UBS Investment Account into Joint Account Y to repay the US$1,800,000 loan ultimately came from a fresh transfer of funds from the Husband, or from any third party source. We note that the Husband has suggested that the Wife may have unilaterally taken the money from him to pay off the US$1,800,000 loan. He also argues that the Wife might have had “other deposits and/or sources of funds in light of the Wife’s history of withdrawal from parties’ joint account(s) and Husband’s sole account”.

</div> We find this argument unpersuasive. If the Wife had indeed obtained the funds to make this payment of US$1,000,000 from the parties’ joint accounts or the Husband’s accounts, the Husband would have had no difficulty adducing evidence to establish this. In fact, the Husband has separately highlighted that the Wife made three withdrawals of S$1,530,000, S$150,000 and S$150,000 from Joint Account X between 6 April 2011 and 6 January 2012, and has argued that the Wife should account for these withdrawals in addition to the Bonds.

Given this lapse of time, it is not possible to conclude that the Wife used the proceeds of the DBS Bonds to make this donation. We consider that the appropriate approach is to treat this US$1,500,000 as being unaccounted for and thus to be included in the matrimonial pool. However, we shall take the donation of RMB8,000,000 into account as an item of the Wife’s expenditure, which goes towards explaining generally what became of the Bonds which the Wife received (see [62] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To conclude, we find that the GE Capital Bonds and the DBS Bonds in items (a) and (b) of the table at [39] above should not have been included in the pool of matrimonial assets because they had matured or were liquidated in 2011 and the proceeds arising therefrom or part thereof have been used to purchase the Lloyds Notes and Kasikornbank Bonds.

</div> In essence, this court is drawing an adverse inference that she received this sum but has failed to disclose it, and that this adverse inference should be given effect to by including this sum of US$1,500,000 in the matrimonial pool (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim </span>[2015] 2 SLR 195 at [66]). In our view, it is appropriate to apply the US-Singapore dollar exchange rate as at the time of the ancillary matters hearing (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 2017). Applying the yearly average exchange rate for 2017 (US$1 = S$1.380662), US$1,500,000 is equivalent to S$2,070,993. This should be added to the sum of S$5,475,605.16 shown in the table above, yielding a total of S$7,546,598.16. In our judgment, this is the value of the Bonds (including the unaccounted proceeds from the DBS Bonds) which the Wife received.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interest earned from the Bonds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In addition to the Bonds, we agree with the Husband that the Wife should also account for the interest which she would have received from those Bonds. We note that the Judge sought to take this interest into account by reducing her assessment of the Wife’s expenditure from S$5,690,043 to a lower figure of S$4,500,000 (Oral Judgment at [33]). It is unclear how the Judge decided on this approach, which effectively assigns a value of S$1,190,043 to the interest from the Bonds; yet if the Judge’s approach was imprecise, it was, in all likelihood, partly contributed by the lack of assistance from counsel as regards the quantification of the interest. The Husband had shifted his position several times and variously claimed that the Wife would have received S$2,300,000 in interest from 2008–2013,

</div>
</div> We agree that the Husband ought to have set out such a time frame to substantiate his calculations. On the other hand, we found the Wife’s response entirely unsatisfactory. It was not her position that she did not receive interest on the Bonds. She clearly did. Further, it was her position that she had sold some of the Bonds on various dates, while others had reached maturity and she then used the proceeds to purchase other Bonds. It follows that any information on the periods she held each of the Bonds and the amount of interest she earned during those periods was entirely within her control. On that basis, she ought to have produced an alternative computation of the interest that she received. It was simply not open to her to complain that the Husband’s estimates were insufficiently substantiated without offering any alternative quantification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In our judgment, even accepting the appropriateness in adopting a broad-brush approach for the division of matrimonial assets (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [81]), the court must nonetheless come to at least some approximate quantification of the interest that the Wife would have earned from the Bonds in order to adequately address the unaccounted interest. The Husband did not explain how he derived some of the figures in his tabular breakdown, which makes it necessary for this court to arrive at its own estimates on the best available evidence. Our findings as to the approximate interest which the Wife would have earned on each of the Bonds are set out in the following table. Since the exact terms of the Bonds are unknown, the calculations <span class="font-italic">conservatively</span> assume that the Bonds yielded simple and not compound interest, that such interest was paid annually and that the Wife only received interest for every <span class="font-italic">full</span> year-long period that she held the Bond, and not for any part thereof.</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Bond</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Period held for</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interest per annum</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Estimated interest earned</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">A$2,000,000 units of GE Capital Bonds</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">11 June 2008  to 29 March 2011 (date of sale by the Wife)

Applying the same reasoning at [51] above, it is appropriate to apply the yearly average exchange rates as at 2017.

Since we have accounted for the interest instead by adding the amount of interest to the value of the Bonds (see [56] above), the downward adjustment applied by the Judge is rendered unnecessary. The question, then, is whether the Judge was right to have estimated the Wife’s total expenditure at S$5,690,043. The Husband argues that the Judge’s analysis contained several double counting errors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Judge estimated the Wife’s monthly expenditure to be about S$33,979 based on the assumption that a cash payment of S$1,529,040 which the Wife received from the Husband was reimbursement for her expenses from 2008 to 2011. She then proceeded with her calculations on the basis that this figure of S$33,979 <span class="font-italic">did not </span><span class="font-italic">include </span>any additional expense which the Wife was incurring in taking care of the Husband’s mother and daughters, as well as the upkeep of the Sea Breeze Property. She therefore added an extra monthly sum of S$7,500 to account for these expenses between 2008 and August 2012, in the period before the Wife moved out of the Sea Breeze Property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Husband contends the approach in (a) was wrong because between 2008 to 2011, the Wife was already paying for the care of the Husband’s mother and his daughters, as well as the upkeep of the Sea Breeze Property. Thus, the reimbursement of S$1,529,040 from the Husband would have covered all these expenses as well. The Judge ought to have computed the Wife’s total expenditure on the basis that the Wife would have spent S$33,979 monthly between January 2008 and August 2012, but thereafter her monthly expenditure would have decreased by S$7,500 to S$26,479 per month when she stopped looking after the Husband’s mother and his daughters.

</div> In other words, her position is that her true expenditure from 2008 to 2017 was not only S$4,381,522, but something in excess of S$6.2 million. In this regard, Ms Yee stressed in her oral argument that the Wife’s monthly expenses were very high because the parties were accustomed to a rather lavish lifestyle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  In our judgment, the Judge took a reasoned approach in estimating the Wife’s expenses on herself and the family (double counting errors aside). For the reasons which were highlighted in the Oral Judgment (at [32]), we agree that the Wife’s assertions that she spent S$55,320 per month on herself and S$25,000 per month on the Sons were incredible and inconsistent with her own evidence. The Judge was right to have rejected these figures and to have used the transfer of S$1,529,040 as a basis for gauging the Wife’s realistic expenses instead. We would add that this approach adequately took into account the very high standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and the Sons. Even with adjustments to correct any double counting errors, the Wife is taken to have spent about S$26,500 per month on herself and the two Sons alone, and this excludes purchases of luxury items and beauty treatments which were charged to supplementary cards paid for directly by the Husband (Oral Judgment at [32(b)]). In our view, this was a suitably generous estimate which adequately reflected the parties’ lifestyle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is not in dispute between the parties that had it not been for the double counting errors, the Judge would have found the Wife’s expenditure to be S$4,381,522. We adopt this figure, subject to one further adjustment. The Wife has adduced proof that she made a one-time donation of RMB8,000,000 (about S$1,607,200, applying the monthly average exchange rate for June 2012 of RMB1 = S$0.2009) to a Buddhist Institute in June 2012 and, as stated earlier, this should be added to her expenditure (see [49] above). Thus, her total expenditure for 2008 to 2017 was S$5,988,722.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 However, that is not the end of the matter. We agree with the Husband that S$1,829,040 in cash which the Wife received between April 2011 and January 2012 (see [59] above) would have covered some of her expenses, and this sum should be offset against the Wife’s total expenditure. S$1,829,040 should thus be deducted from S$5,988,722, yielding a figure of S$4,159,682 as the value of Bonds and interest income which the Wife is able to account for by reference to her expenditure.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The bonds which the Wife currently holds</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Wife submits that out of the total value of the Bonds, she has “already accounted for S$2,019,225.47 which was declared as part of her assets”.

</div> and we therefore say no more on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Before we analyse the remaining alleged dissipations from the parties’ joint accounts, it should be noted that the Husband made an application in SUM 74/2018 to adduce further evidence in connection with certain alleged withdrawals from Joint Account Y. The further evidence sought to be adduced took the form of bank statements for two other joint accounts of the parties. These statements would allegedly show that the monies said to have been dissipated from Joint Account Y were instead transferred into these two other joint accounts, and used to pay off short term loans in connection with foreign exchange trading.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We dismissed the application because we found that the Husband had not satisfied the requirements for adducing further evidence, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>[1954] 1 WLR 1489 (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Mykytow</span><span class="font-italic">ych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel </span>[2016] 4 SLR 829 at [47]). Crucially, the bank statements which the Husband sought to adduce did not constitute evidence which could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use in the proceedings below. In fact, when the Wife requested discovery of these very bank statements, the Husband refused to furnish them on the ground that these were joint accounts and that the Wife could obtain the statements herself. In the light of these facts, we saw no reason why the Husband should be allowed to introduce these bank statements into evidence belatedly. This evidence, thus, did not feature in our analysis. As we shall explain below at [79], however, this is of no consequence because we see no reason to draw an adverse inference against the Husband in respect of these withdrawals from Joint Account Y in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Turning to our analysis proper, the law on adverse inferences is well-established. The court should not draw an adverse inference unless (a) there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and (b) that person has some particular access to the information he is said to be concealing or withholding (<span class="font-italic">Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Huah </span>[2007] SGCA 21 at [28]). As for the first of these requirements, there must be some evidence which suggests on its face that the party in question has deliberately sought to conceal or deplete some assets which would otherwise be available for division. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Not every unexplained withdrawal or decrease in value in a bank account over time will be sufficient to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of dissipation. In this regard, we agree with the observation of Lee Kim Shin JC in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yen Chuan (</span><span class="font-italic">m.w.) v Lim Theam Siew </span>[2014] SGHC 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yen Chuan</span>”) at [33] that withdrawals of money which may legitimately be explained as personal expenditures should generally be disregarded. To this, we would add that in the appropriate case, withdrawals which might be legitimately explained as genuine expenditures on business or investments ought similarly to be disregarded. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yen </span><span class="font-italic">Chuan</span>, the court considered it appropriate to disregard the movement of sums falling “anywhere between several hundreds of dollars to a couple of thousands” (at [33]), but there is no hard and fast rule as to the quantitative threshold at which the court will find that a withdrawal of money does or does not call for an explanation. Rather, this is necessarily a fact-sensitive matter and the court will consider the evidence in the context of the parties’ habits, lifestyles, business activities, and amount of the withdrawal(s) in relation to the total value of the matrimonial assets in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In this case, three factors had a bearing on our analysis. First, it is common ground that the parties led lavish lifestyles. The Wife has herself stated on affidavit that during the marriage she purchased over 70 luxury handbags costing up to S$20,000 per piece, over 20 luxury watches costing between S$40,000 to S$130,000 per piece, as well as clothing, shoes and jewellery from high-end luxury brands. These items were paid for using supplementary credit cards provided and paid for by the Husband.

</div> The Husband, too, would have had personal expenses of his own. Secondly, the parties were savvy investors who regularly took out loans and moved sums of money between numerous bank accounts in order to finance the purchase of bonds and other investments. Thirdly, the Husband was a businessman who would have had to meet the costs and expenses of his business activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Seen in this context, the mere fact that the Husband has not explained exactly why and for what purpose he withdrew sums between S$4,096 to €230,000 (approximately equivalent to S$492,361) does not, in our judgment, call for an adverse inference to be drawn against him. Ten such withdrawals took place between July 2008 and November 2011:

If the Husband had intended to siphon off funds, he could simply have made a one-time withdrawal of a lump sum, or a few large withdrawals from the joint accounts. Instead, there were ten withdrawals of varying amounts over a period of three years. Many of the amounts withdrawn were not round figures but very specific sums of money (down to the cent) which suggests that the Husband was likely withdrawing these sums to pay for particular expenditures or to pay off specific loans. On the whole, the timing and amounts of these withdrawals do not support the inference of an orchestrated design to remove funds from the parties’ joint accounts. It also bears mention that the above ten withdrawals add up to a total of S$1,562,066 withdrawn between July 2008 and November 2011, and this, incidentally, is only slightly more than the S$1,529,040 which the Wife claims she received in October 2011 as reimbursement for personal and household expenses from 2008 to 2011 (see [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Having disposed of these ten smaller withdrawals, we turn to address four substantial withdrawals (or alleged withdrawals) which the Wife claims the Husband has not satisfactorily accounted for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 First, the Wife complains of a so-called “withdrawal” of S$2,963,745.19 from Joint Account X between 31 July 2008 and 28 February 2013.

The fact that the account balance had dropped by close to S$3 million over a period of four years and eight months did not, in and of itself, suggest that the Husband had siphoned off any money from the account.

</div> and this transfer alone would account for almost half of the total decrease in the account balance. We would add, by way of an aside, that most of the withdrawals from Joint Account X discussed in [78] above took place within this very time period, and they would have contributed to the decrease in the account balance between these two dates. Seen in that light, it was disingenuous of the Wife to argue that an adverse inference should be drawn in respect of <span class="font-italic">both </span>those individual withdrawals <span class="font-italic">and </span>the overall drop in the account balance between January 2008 and February 2013.

Once again, this was not actually <span class="font-italic">a</span> single monolithic withdrawal. Rather, the Wife’s basis for alleging there was such a withdrawal is a decrease of US$13,133,363 (approximately S$17,963,813.91) in the account over these two dates. Of this decrease, the Wife accepts that the Husband has accounted for HK$67,050,000 (approximately S$11,686,815) as an investment expenditure, which leaves S$6,276,998.91 unaccounted for.

</div> In contrast to the drop in the account balance of S$2,963,745.19 over almost five years (see [81]–[82] above), this was a movement of a much larger amount over a much shorter period of about two months. Ordinarily, we would agree that such a large drop in the balance of an account over a short span of time would call for an explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Husband’s explanation is simple.

</div> In our view, this explanation accords with the evidence. The value of the assets held in Joint Account X as at 31 May 2008 included the GE Capital Bonds (which, according to the account statement, had a market value of US$1,516,684) and the DBS Bonds (which had a market value of US$2,675,000).

</div> We re-iterate that an adverse inference will only be drawn if the person against whom it is sought has some <span class="font-italic">particular access </span>to the information he is said to be concealing. Here, the information which the Husband might possibly be “hiding” is information (such as the full account statements) which would show in greater detail the transactions and withdrawals from Joint Account X and how the decrease in the account balance came about. Yet this is a <span class="font-italic">joint </span>account and the Wife has full access to its statements (see <span class="font-italic">UAP v UAQ </span>[2018] 3 SLR 319 at [41]). In this light, the Wife cannot simply point to a fall in the account balance over a period of almost two years and claim that it calls for an explanation from the Husband. Further, in our view, given the parties’ lifestyles, investment activity and habits, a decrease of S$600,082.59 in account balance over a period of 15 months may well be legitimately explained as part of the parties’ ordinary expenditure.

It is clear that this transaction was effected entirely through him as the Wife’s representative and that if there is any information concerning the whereabouts of the proceeds, he would have particular access to it. We therefore agree that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband in respect of this transaction. Applying 2017 exchange rates (RMB1 = S$0.2043; see [51] above), RMB 18,390,000 is equivalent to S$3,757,077.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For completeness, we note the Husband has argued that the Wife had pursued an action in the Chinese courts to enforce her creditor’s rights and was “simply trying to place the burden of recovering the said debt on the Husband”.

</div> it appears that this was not done. Nevertheless, we bear in mind that earlier in this judgment, when dealing with the Wife’s accounting for the Bonds, we were prepared to find that the Wife would have spent about S$4,381,522 from 2008 to 2017 on herself, the Sons, and the Husband’s mother and daughters from a previous marriage. This was despite the absence of clear documentary evidence. Similarly, here, although the Husband did not have to pay for household and family expenses unlike the Wife, he would have other expenses to cover. For example, it is not in dispute that he <span class="font-italic">was </span>involved in litigation, which meant that he would have had some legal fees and costs to cover. We also note that the Judge did not appear to have difficulty with his claim that he had invested a total of about US$3,000,000 in Xinjiang Qiangte (Oral Judgment at [9]), S$2,500,000 of which he asserted was drawn from the proceeds of the sale of his HPI shares to LHZ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Taking the circumstances in the round, and adopting a broad-brush approach, we think it is fair to proceed on the basis that the Husband would likely have spent about S$3,000,000 of the sale proceeds of his HPI shares on his personal expenditure, his investments in Xinjiang Qiangte, and other expenses such as his legal costs and arbitration fees. This is in addition to and separate from other sums of money which we have made allowances for in the Husband’s favour so far, such as the withdrawals totalling S$1,562,066 between July 2008 and October 2011 (see [79] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Thus, of the sale proceeds of HK$8,004,000 and RMB42,200,000, we find that the Husband has accounted for the following sums:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) RMB7,000,000 spent on Chinese government bonds;

She argues that the Husband has provided no evidence to support his claim that he used the sale proceeds for the purchase of another property (“the Bayshore Property”) and to finance the purchase of the Sea Breeze Property. The Wife stresses that the Bayshore Property and Sea Breeze Property were purchased in 2000 and 2002, and thus it “cannot be” that the proceeds from the sales of the Harvey Crescent Properties in 2007 were used to purchase them.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, this court declined to draw an adverse inference against a wife in respect of proceeds from the surrender of two insurance policies, for which the wife had allegedly failed to provide a satisfactory explanation. In coming to this decision, the court accepted the wife’s argument that she had surrendered the insurance policies three to six years before the commencement of the divorce proceedings, and thus found that the proceeds were “likely to have been amalgamated with other funds and dealt with accordingly in the ordinary course of the family’s life” (at [19]). There was no evidence that divorce proceedings were contemplated at those dates, and there would have been no reason for the wife to dissipate the funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Similarly, the Harvey Crescent Properties were sold five years before the commencement of divorce proceedings. There is nothing to suggest that the parties had contemplated a breakdown of their relationship at the time. Whether or not any clear link can be shown between the sale proceeds of the Harvey Crescent properties and the purchase of the Sea Breeze and the Bayshore Properties, it is likely that the proceeds were “amalgamated with other funds and dealt with… in the ordinary course of the family’s life”. There being no substratum of evidence which discloses any <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case against the Husband, we do not draw any adverse inference against him with regard to these sale proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 To conclude on this topic of adverse inferences, we find that the Husband has failed to satisfactorily account for the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The transfer of A$1,208,343 (approximately S$1,278,976.69) from the parties’ joint Merrill Lynch Account into his sole account (see [86] above); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The proceeds of the sale of the Wife’s creditor’s rights over Hebei Gaozhen to LHZ for RMB18,390,000 (amounting to S$3,757,077) (see [92] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) S$5,303,106.74 in proceeds from the sale of the HPI shares (see [100] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Thus, a total of S$10,339,160.43 should be added back to the matrimonial pool and attributed to the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ratio of division</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 We have dealt with the issues pertaining to the identity and value of the assets in the matrimonial pool, and turn now to the appropriate ratio for division. This being a single-income marriage, the structured approach laid down in <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span><span class="font-italic">v ANK</span> did not apply. The Judge instead considered the precedents and found that “in a marriage with <span class="font-italic">similar </span>factual matrix”, the trend was towards equal division (Oral Judgment at [43]). She thus applied an equal division of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 We disagree with this aspect of the Judge’s reasoning. In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK, </span>this court observed that the trend in <span class="font-italic">long </span>single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but <span class="font-italic">different considerations </span>may attach to short single-income marriages<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">ATT v ATS </span>[2012] 2 SLR 859 at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <span class="font-italic">UGG v UGH</span><span class="font-italic"> (m.w.) </span>[2017] SGHCF 25, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <span class="font-italic">ABX v ABY</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2014] 2 SLR 969, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the present case, the marriage was on the shorter end of this 10 to 15-year range. On the other hand, however, the Wife was not a typical homemaker in a single income family. Rather, she became <span class="font-italic">solely</span> responsible for caring for the family, and particularly the Sons, after the Husband left for China in 2008. We also take into account the fact that she had the assistance of domestic helpers, but even allowing for this, her indirect contributions should be given considerable weight. She had cared not only for the Sons, but also for the Husband’s aged parents and daughters from a previous marriage while he was overseas. In the circumstances, we find that the appropriate apportionment is for the Husband to receive 65% of the assets, while the Wife receives 35%.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on division of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the light of our findings above, the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets is set out in the following table:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Asset (Liability)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Value ($, rounding off to the nearest dollar)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Joint Names</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Sea Breeze Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">7,219,865</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Telok Kurau Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,570,318</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Merrill Lynch WM Account</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">UBS Investment Account</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">(23,933)

She points to the fact that she had initially stated that [T]’s monthly expenses cost over S$14,000 while [J]’s monthly expenses cost over S$12,531, and that she has already adjusted her claim downwards “given the new realities of the divorce”. In our view, the Judge’s decision that the Husband should pay S$3,500 for each Son was reasonable, having regard to their ages, lifestyles, and the Husband’s financial resources.

<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Steven Chong JA):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome:<em> </em>CoA allows appeals against High Court’s decision as to
the division of matrimonial assets, and grants order for lump sum
maintenance for children of marriage.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The material facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 These were cross appeals against the orders of the High Court Judge (“the
Judge”) regarding the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. The
parties were married for about 11 years and four months. The wife (“the
Wife”) was a homemaker while the husband (“the Husband”) worked as a
business consultant. There were two sons from the marriage, aged 14 and 12,
respectively (collectively, “the Sons”), who lived with the Wife in
Singapore. The Husband relocated to China for work sometime in 2008, and
has permanently resided there since.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 On 13 November 2017, the Judge made orders as to ancillary matters. On
the premise of an equal distribution of the pool of matrimonial assets
between the parties, she ordered the Husband to pay the Wife a balance sum
of S$18,000 after taking into account the assets held by each party. She
also ordered that the Husband pay no maintenance for the Wife and aggregate
monthly maintenance of S$7,000 for the Sons.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 In Civil Appeal No 215 of 2017 (“CA 215/2017”), the Wife appealed against
the Judge’s orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets and the
issue of maintenance. Amongst other things, the Wife argued that the Judge
erred in her valuation of various assets, including certain bonds in the
Wife’s name (“the Bonds”). The Wife claimed the Judge also erred in
omitting to draw adverse inferences against the Husband. She further argued
that she, as well as the Sons, should be awarded maintenance in a lump sum.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 In Civil Appeal No 223 of 2017 (“CA 223/2017”), the Husband argued that
the Judge understated the value the Bonds, and erred in awarding the Wife
an equal share of the pool of matrimonial assets.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision on appeal</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 CA 215/2017 and CA 223/2017 were both allowed in part. The Husband was
ordered to transfer assets worth S$5,671,797 to the Wife within six months
of the judgment. The Husband was also ordered to pay a lump sum of
S$769,000 in maintenance for the Sons. The parties were ordered to bear
their own costs of the appeals.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Reasons for the judgment </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The court would not readily interfere with orders made by a court below
pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets (at [<strong>1</strong>]).
In the present case, appellate intervention was necessitated by several
computational errors and omissions by the Judge to consider issues which,
though raised by the parties, were not actively pursued by counsel below
during the oral hearings (at [<strong>2</strong>]). This case demonstrated
that it was important for counsel to do their part to assist the court in
achieving a just outcome in each case. Particularly in complicated
matrimonial litigation where there are myriad issues pertaining to the
accounting and valuation of assets, counsel have a crucial role to play in
apprising the court of their clients’ positions and the supporting evidence
on all key issues. Where multiple rounds of submissions and affidavits have
been filed, and the parties’ positions may have evolved over the course of
the proceedings, counsel should update the court of any changes in their
clients’ positions (at [<strong>3</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 The court adjusted the Judge’s orders in relation to four broad issues:
(a) the valuation of certain matrimonial assets; (b) the drawing of adverse
inferences against the Husband; (c) the ratio of division of the
matrimonial assets; and (d) maintenance.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Valuation of assets</em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 There was no serious dispute between the parties that three errors of
calculation were made in the judgment below (at [<strong>30</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 The Wife was entitled to argue on appeal that she did not receive S$11m
worth of Bonds from the Husband, notwithstanding her former counsel’s
concession to the contrary in the proceedings below. She was relying on
evidence and information that was already before the court, and permitting
her to raise this point on appeal would not cause any prejudice to the
Husband (at [<strong>37</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The values of two of the Bonds should not have been included by the
Judge in the pool of matrimonial assets because they had matured or were
liquidated, and the proceeds, or part thereof, had been used to purchase
other Bonds which were included in the asset pool (at [<strong>50</strong>
]). However, the Wife should also account for the interest which she would
have earned from the Bonds (at [<strong>52</strong>]). On a conservative
estimation, the amount of interest earned by the Wife was at least S$1.58m
(at [<strong>55</strong>]). The total value of the Bonds and interest was
about S$9.14m. Of this sum, the Wife had adequately accounted for S$4.16m
as her expenditure between January 2008 and October 2017 (at [    <strong>61</strong>]–[<strong>63</strong>]). She had also accounted for
S$2.70m as the value of the Bonds which she had converted into her current
portfolio of bond investments (at [<strong>68</strong>]). The balance
unaccounted for was about $2.28m.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Adverse inferences</em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 The court should not draw an adverse inference unless (a) there was a
substratum of evidence which established a <em>prima facie</em> case
against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and (b) that
person had some particular access to the information he was said to be
withholding (at [<strong>75</strong>]). Not every unexplained withdrawal or
decrease in value in a bank account over time would be sufficient to raise
a prima facie case of dissipation. Withdrawals of money which may
legitimately be explained as personal or business expenditures should
generally be disregarded. As to the quantitative threshold at which the
court would find that a withdrawal of money called for an explanation, this
was a fact-sensitive matter to be considered in the context of the parties’
habits, lifestyles, business activities, and the total value of the
matrimonial assets in question (at [<strong>76</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 The court declined to draw any adverse inference with regard to several
smaller withdrawals which the Wife claimed that the Husband had not
satisfactorily accounted for (at [<strong>77</strong>]). On the whole, the
timing and amounts of these withdrawals did not support the inference of an
orchestrated design to remove funds (at [<strong>79</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 On the other hand, an adverse inference was warranted in respect of the
Husband’s transfer of approximately S$1.28m from the parties’ joint account
into his sole bank account. Information in relation to this transfer of
such a large sum of money was within the Husband’s particular access (at [    <strong>86</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 An adverse inference was also warranted in respect of the missing
proceeds of two sales of the Husband’s shares, and a sale of the Wife’s
creditor’s rights which the Husband had carried out on the Wife’s behalf.
With regard to the latter, there was a sufficient substratum of evidence to
disclose a <em>prima facie</em> case against the Husband because the
documents relating to this transaction listed the Husband as the Wife’s
authorised representative, and were also signed by him. If there was any
information concerning the whereabouts of the proceeds, the Husband would
have particular access to it (at [<strong>92</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
15 In total, the Husband had failed to satisfactorily account for about
$10.34m worth of unexplained transfers and missing proceeds. This amount
was to be added back to the matrimonial pool and attributed to the Husband
(at [<strong>109</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Ratio of division</em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
16 The appropriate apportionment was for the Husband to receive 65% of the
matrimonial assets, and the Wife to receive 35%. This was a single-income
marriage. For single-income marriages in the 10–15-year range, the trend
from previous cases was to award the non-income earning party about 25% to
35% of the matrimonial pool (at [<strong>113</strong>]). Although the
marriage in this case was on the shorter end of the 10–15-year range, it
was appropriate for the Wife to receive 35% of the assets given that she
became solely responsible for caring for the family, including the
Husband’s aged parents and daughters from a previous marriage, after the
Husband left for China in 2008 (at [<strong>114</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
17 Out of the total value of the matrimonial assets (S$26.18m), the Wife
was entitled to 35%, that is, S$9.16m. Thus, she ought to receive S$5.67m
worth of assets from the Husband, in addition to retaining her current
assets of S$3.49m (at [<strong>116</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Maintenance</em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
18 The court’s power to order maintenance was supplementary to its power to
order a division of matrimonial assets. If, from the division of
matrimonial assets, there was a sum which, if invested properly, would be
sufficient to maintain the wife, then the award of maintenance should be no
more than necessary to allow the wife to weather the transition of the
divorce (at [<strong>118</strong>]). The court thus declined to award the
Wife maintenance for herself. She had been awarded assets worth over S$9m.
If she managed these assets properly, they should yield an income
sufficient for her maintenance (at [<strong>119</strong>]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
19 The Judge’s decision that the Husband should pay S$3,500 in respect of
maintenance for each Son was reasonable, having regard to their ages,
lifestyles, and the Husband’s financial resources (at [<strong>120</strong>
]). A lump sum payment was appropriate as there was ample reason to believe
that the Husband would default on future payments. Thus, the Husband ought
to pay a S$581,000 lump sum in addition to the arrears of S$188,000 (at [    <strong>121</strong>]–[<strong>122</strong>]).
