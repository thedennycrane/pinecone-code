        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal raised the novel issue of whether
                    the Singapore courts have the jurisdiction under the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to order the division
                    of matrimonial assets and maintenance if the marriage between the parties is
                    found to be void. The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) held that the
                    Singapore courts have neither jurisdiction (see <em>ADP v
                        ADQ</em> [2011] 3 SLR 370 (“the Judgment”)).
                    We allowed the appeal after hearing arguments from the Appellant (as we explain
                    below, the Respondent was not present at the hearing). We now provide the
                    detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties and the void marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant, a Philippines national, had
                    married the Respondent, a United Kingdom (“UK”) national, in Hong
                    Kong on 26 October 1995 (“the Hong Kong
                        Marriage”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant had previously married a Japanese
                    man on 1 December 1989 (“the Japanese Marriage”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The
                    Japanese Marriage resulted in a divorce, which was finalised in Japan only on
                    7 December 1995.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It should be noted that the Hong
                    Kong Marriage was contracted <em>before</em> the Japanese
                    Marriage was terminated. This meant that the Hong Kong Marriage was void due to
                        bigamy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant filed a petition for divorce on
                    25 March 2003. The divorce proceedings resulted in an uncontested hearing
                    on 26 August 2003 at which a <em>decree nisi</em> was
                        granted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The parties later found out that the Hong Kong
                    Marriage was void. The Respondent then filed an application (Summons-in-chambers
                    No 651299 of 2004) on 11 August 2004 seeking, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to set aside the <em>decree nisi</em>
                    and to declare that the Hong Kong Marriage was void (“the Rescission
                        Proceedings”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Appellant also took
                    out a nullity petition on 15 October 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Rescission Proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Rescission Proceedings were heard by a
                    District Judge (“the first District Judge”). In a written
                    judgment, the first District Judge rescinded the <em>decree
                        nisi</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She declined, however, to grant the
                    declaration (to the effect that the Hong Kong marriage was void) sought by the
                    Husband for three reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Family Court did not have the
                        jurisdiction to make the declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The application for a declaration should be heard by the
                        High Court through an originating summons and not through an application
                        within the divorce proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if the correct procedures were followed and the
                        Family Court was the correct forum to hear the application for a
                        declaration, it was more appropriate for the validity of the Hong Kong
                        Marriage to be determined in a nullity petition. Importantly, the first
                        District Judge proceeded to elaborate that one of the reasons why she
                        thought a nullity petition was more appropriate was that <em>ancillary relief is available to parties to a void and voidable
                            marriage</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> She noted,
                        however, that there might be an issue of whether maintenance may be ordered
                        to a wife in a void marriage because she was, arguably, never a
                        “wife”. She did not elaborate because she thought that the
                        availability of maintenance was an issue that she did not have to decide at
                        that point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    third reason is important because, as will be seen below, it has given rise to
                    an argument of <em>res </em><em>judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Respondent appealed the first District
                    Judge’s decision to the High Court. The High Court Judge dismissed the
                    appeal without issuing written grounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Family Court later declared in the nullity
                    petition that the Hong Kong Marriage was void. The court then directed that
                    ancillary matters were to be adjourned for a further hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The ancillary matters came before another
                    District Judge (“the second District Judge”) who ruled, <em>inter alia</em>, that the court did not have the power to
                    order the payment of maintenance or the division of matrimonial assets because
                    the judgment for nullity had been granted on the ground that the marriage was
                    void (see <em>ADP v ADQ</em>
                        [2009] SGDC 489).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant appealed that decision to the
                    High Court. The High Court’s decision with regard to the particular issue
                    set out in the preceding paragraph is the subject of the present appeal (as for
                    the issue that was not appealed, see below at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge began his analysis by examining the
                    wording of the relevant provisions of the Act, <em>viz</em>, ss 112(1) and 113 of the Act. It would be useful, in this
                    regard, to set out these provisions in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Power of court to order division
                            of matrimonial assets</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>112.</b>—(1)  The court shall
                        have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of
                        divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division
                        between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset
                        and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such
                        asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Power of court to order
                            maintenance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>113.</b>  The court may order a man to pay maintenance
                        to his wife or former wife —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) during the course of any matrimonial
                            proceedings; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce,
                            judicial separation or nullity of marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge noted that the use of the phrase “nullity
                    of marriage” in s 112(1) of the Act has caused uncertainty because
                    it encompasses two types of marriages, <em>viz</em>, void
                    and voidable marriages (see the Judgment at [8]). The Judge explained that under the Act, a judgment of
                    nullity may be obtained for both void and voidable marriages (see the Judgment
                    at [9]). He then briefly described the
                    differences between void and voidable marriages (see the Judgment at [10]–[12]). He concluded that the wording of s 112(1) does not
                    offer any indication as to whether “nullity of marriage” refers to
                    both void and voidable marriages. He was, however, prepared to take the view
                    that the court has the power to divide matrimonial assets in the context of a
                        <em>voidable</em> marriage on the ground that assets
                    acquired up to the point of dissolution are matrimonial assets (see the Judgment
                    at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Judge proceeded to express his view that
                    it is not appropriate for a court to determine the effects of a void marriage
                    (see the Judgment at [14]). This is
                    because a marriage may be found to be void for various reasons. For example, a
                    party may have acted in good faith or he/she might have been deceptive. These
                    different factual situations would require different treatment and would require
                    a consideration of “legal, sociological and public policy
                    considerations” (see the Judgment at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Judge nevertheless proceeded to rule that
                    a division of matrimonial assets is not possible where the marriage is void. He
                    reasoned that a void marriage is not a marriage and so there are no
                    “matrimonial assets” to divide. Assets acquired in the course of
                    the marriage will have to be divided according to property, contract, trust or
                    other relevant principles of law (see the Judgment at [15]). Similarly, the Judge ruled that it was
                    not possible to order maintenance because s 113 of the Act refers to
                    maintenance of a “wife or former wife”. A claimant in a void
                    marriage is neither (see the Judgment at [16]). The Judge further commented that it might have been
                    argued that there is another basis for seeking maintenance if the parties had
                    maintained their relationship in the belief that they had a legal marriage. The
                    Judge observed, however, that this possibility “must remain as food for
                    thought” because the Appellant did not raise such a possibility (see the
                    Judgment at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It should be noted that the decision below
                    also addressed an issue of maintenance for the Appellant’s child from a
                    previous relationship. The Judge’s decision on this issue was not
                        appealed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant raised a preliminary argument
                    that the issues of whether the court has jurisdiction under the Act to order the
                    division of matrimonial assets and maintenance are <em>res
                        </em><em>judicata</em> as between the parties
                    because they were conclusively decided by the first District Judge whose
                    decision was upheld on appeal (“the <em>Res
                        </em><em>Judicata</em> Argument”).
                    Incidentally, it should be noted that the Appellant’s counsel had raised
                    the <em>Res </em><em>Judicata</em>
                    Argument at the hearing before the Judge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Judge did not,
                    however, address the argument in the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Appellant raised the following arguments
                    on the substance of the appeal in her Appellant’s Case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge erred in holding that the
                        phrase “nullity of marriage” under s 112 of the Act
                        refers only to a voidable marriage and not to a void marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge erred in adopting an unduly
                        restrictive interpretation of s 112 of the Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Recognising that the court has the
                        jurisdiction to order the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance
                        would accord the court the discretion to take into account the particular
                        facts of the case in order to arrive at a fair decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In this case, the
                        fact that the Appellant was unaware of her legal impediment to marriage
                        could be taken into account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

                        she would have had if the marriage was legal because she did not deceive the
                        Respondent and the parties lived together for a long time believing
                        themselves to be husband and wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The

                        equivalent of the Act if she had no <em>mens

                        should be followed. The English cases should be followed because the Act is
                        adapted from English law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

                        maintenance in a void marriage, the court should have the power to order the
                        division of matrimonial assets because the same issues and problems that the
                        parties need to resolve in relation to their property arise whether or not

                        duration of the marriage. The Appellant made substantial contributions
                        towards the marriage and the acquisition of the matrimonial assets. The

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At the hearing before us, counsel for the
                    Appellant, Prof Tan Cheng Han SC (“Prof Tan”),
                    raised the following additional arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The fact that s 113 of the Act
                        uses the words “wife” or “former wife” does not
                        mean that maintenance may not be ordered in favour of the female party to a
                        void marriage. This is apparent from s 104 of the Act which provides
                        that any “husband or wife” may file a writ claiming a judgment
                        of nullity in respect of his or her marriage. This suggests that the words
                        “wife” or “former wife” in s 113 of the Act
                        are simply labels used to denote the female party to the void
                        marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     It
                        may be argued (in this instance, <em>contrary</em> to
                        the Appellant’s case) that interpreting s 113 of the Act as
                        allowing an award of maintenance even if a marriage is found to be void will
                        render s 113 of the Act incongruous with s 69 of the Act.
                        Section 69 of the Act concerns an order for maintenance to a
                        “married woman” while the marriage is still subsisting. The
                        phrase “married woman” is defined in s 2 of the Act as a
                        woman “validly married under any law, religion, custom or
                        usage”. In other words, a woman in a void marriage is not a
                        “married woman” and, hence, would not be able to claim
                        maintenance under s 69 of the Act. An argument could be made that it
                        would be incongruous to say that a woman is not entitled to maintenance
                        while a void marriage is “subsisting” but yet is entitled to
                        maintenance under s 113 of the Act after she obtains a judgment of
                        nullity. Prof Tan submitted that this incongruity may be explained away
                        by the fact that s 113 of the Act uses the words “wife or former
                        wife”, a phrase which is not defined in the Act, whereas s 69 of
                        the Act uses the phrase “married woman”, which, as just
                        mentioned, is defined in s 2 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The court has the power to take into account all
                        the relevant circumstances of the case in deciding on the division of
                        matrimonial assets and in ordering maintenance. This means that the court
                        may take into consideration any egregious conduct on the part of one of the
                        parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Women’s Charter (Cap 47, 1970 Rev Ed)
                        (“the 1970 Rev Ed”) did not draw a distinction between
                        void and voidable marriages. Section 91 of the 1970 Rev Ed simply
                        provided for the grounds for seeking a decree of nullity, including the
                        ground “that the former husband or wife of either party was living at
                        the time of the marriage and the marriage with such former husband or wife
                        was then in force”. Significantly, s 107(1) of the 1970 Rev
                        Ed provided, <em>inter alia</em>, that on any decree
                        for nullity of marriage, “the court may, if it thinks fit, order that
                        the husband shall, to the satisfaction of the court, secure to the wife such
                        gross sum of money or such annual sum of money for any term not exceeding
                        her life”. Prof Tan submitted that the effect of these
                        provisions was that under the 1970 Rev Ed, the court could order
                        maintenance even in the context of an annulled marriage. Prof Tan argued
                        that Parliament could not have intended to change the legal position when
                        the distinction between void and voidable marriages was later introduced. It
                        would be unusual for Parliament to have made such a drastic change in the
                        law without expressly saying so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent did not file his case for the
                    present proceedings. Incidentally, his solicitors at the proceedings below had
                    applied to discharge themselves (in Summons No 3258 of 2011) on the ground
                    that they have not been able to contact him for instructions on the conduct of

                    (“Mr Khwaja”), who was present in the public gallery at the

          <em>Res </em>
<em>judicata</em> comprises cause of action estoppel, issue
                    estoppel and abuse of process (see the decision of this court in <em>Wing Joo </em><em>Loong Ginseng Hong
                        (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another

                    to be shown (<em>ibid</em>, citing <em>Lee
                        Tat Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301</em> [2005]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In relation to the requirement of identical
                    subject matter, three matters ought to be borne in mind (see <em>Wing Joo </em><em>Loong Ginseng Hong</em> at
                    [167] citing <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian
                    Teck</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [34]–[35], [38]). First, the
                    prior decision must “traverse the same ground”. Second, the
                    determination of the issue allegedly estopped “must have been fundamental
                    and not merely collateral to the previous decision”. Third, the issue
                    allegedly estopped should have been raised and argued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It would be helpful to explain the context of
                    the <em>Res </em><em>Judicata</em>
                    Argument. According to the Appellant, in the Rescission Proceedings, both the
                    first District Judge and the High Court Judge on appeal considered the
                    parties’ detailed submissions and held that the courts have the power to
                    make ancillary orders under Pt X of the Act even for void
                        marriages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> As noted above, one
                    of the reasons for the first District Judge’s refusal to grant a
                    declaration that the Hong Kong Marriage was void was that she thought that a
                    nullity petition would be a more appropriate avenue for making such a
                    determination (see [6(c)] above). In elaborating on this reason, the first
                    District Judge opined that ancillary relief may be obtained for void as well as
                    voidable marriages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Our view was that the second and third
                    elements of issue estoppel are certainly satisfied. The parties to the
                    Rescission Proceedings and the present proceedings (an appeal against a
                    Judge’s determination on ancillary matters) are identical and the
                    decisions of the first District Judge (and the High Court Judge on appeal) were
                    made by courts of competent jurisdiction. The issue is with the first and final
                    elements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We did not think, however, that the first and
                    final elements were satisfied. In respect of the final element, there was no
                    identity in the subject matter of the Rescission Proceedings and the present
                    proceedings. In the Rescission Proceedings, the first District Judge was asked
                    to rescind the <em>decree nisi</em> and declare that the
                    Hong Kong Marriage was void. The first District Judge gave three reasons why it
                    was inappropriate to grant a declaration. In explaining just one of her reasons,
                    she expressed a view on the availability of ancillary relief. In contrast, the
                    present proceedings raised squarely for decision the issue of whether ancillary
                    relief is available. In other words, the first District Judge’s view that
                    ancillary relief is available in void marriages was <em>collateral</em> to the issue that she had to decide. She was not
                    required to express such a view. In fact, the first District Judge herself
                    appeared to recognise that it was not her role to decide on whether ancillary
                    relief is available for void marriages. On the issue as to whether maintenance
                    is available in void marriages, the first District Judge qualified her
                    observation with a comment that the possibility of obtaining maintenance was an
                    issue that she “[did] not have to decide now”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> For
                    the same reasons, the first District Judge (and the High Court Judge on appeal)
                    did not conclusively decide on the issues raised in this appeal and the first
                    element was not satisfied. The first District Judge was merely expressing a view
                    on the issues in order to bolster her conclusions on the matter that was before
                    her (which was different from the subject matter of this appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We therefore found that there was no <em>res </em><em>judicata</em> in respect of
                    the remaining two issues before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Do Singapore courts have the power to divide matrimonial assets and
                order maintenance in the context of a void marriage?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It would be convenient to consider the second
                    and third issues together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Since these two issues are, essentially,
                    issues of statutory interpretation, we will begin our analysis with an
                    examination of the wording of the relevant provisions. We will then test our
                    interpretation of the provisions against the legislative and historical
                    background. Finally, general policy and principle will be
                considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The statutory language</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is now axiomatic that a <em>purposive</em> approach ought to be taken in the context of statutory
                    construction (see, for example, s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    2002 Rev Ed) as well as the decision of this court in <em>Joseph Mathew and another v Singh Chiranjeev and another</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 338 at [32] and that of
                    the Singapore High Court in <em>PP v Low Kok Heng</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183). In this regard, the first port of call ought to
                    be the statutory language of the provision or provisions being construed. If the
                    meaning of the statutory language is plain and clear, then the court ought to
                    give effect to that meaning. What the court ought <em>not</em> to do is to <em>superimpose</em> what
                        <em>it</em> feels <em>ought</em>
                    to be the meaning of the statutory provision concerned, <em>notwithstanding</em> the plain meaning of the statutory
                    language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Turning to the statutory language of both
                    ss 112(1) and 113(<em>b</em>) of the Act, the critical
                    reference is the presence in both provisions of the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage”. The Judge seemed to take the view that there ought to be read
                    into this phrase a reference <em>only</em> to a <em>voidable</em> (as opposed to a void) marriage. With respect,
                    this is inconsistent with the manner in which the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage” has been utilised by the Singapore Parliament in the Act
                    itself. Indeed, this very phrase constitutes the heading which helms the
                    preceding chapter of Pt X of the Act, which relates to <em>both</em> void <em>and</em> voidable marriages.
                    In our view, if Parliament had intended the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage” in the aforementioned provisions to refer to <em>voidable</em> marriages <em>only</em>, it would
                    have stated so <em>expressly</em>. Lest it be thought that
                    such a plain reading of both provisions would militate against the tenor and
                    spirit of the Act in general and the specific provisions therein in particular,
                    we elaborate on the legislative background in more detail below (at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>). Nevertheless, even if we look only at the provisions
                    themselves, it is clear, in our view, that Parliament <em>intended</em>, in no uncertain terms, that the courts exercise their
                    powers pursuant to ss 112(1) and 113(<em>b</em>) in
                    all cases relating to nullity of marriage (which, as already noted above in this
                    paragraph, includes both void as well as voidable marriages)<em>.</em> That is the <em>plain and
                        unambiguous</em> meaning of the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage”, read <em>both</em> literally <em>as well as</em> in the context alluded to briefly above.
                    Further, no absurdity results from such a construction. Whilst courts have long
                    discarded a dogmatic as well as mechanistic approach towards statutory
                    interpretation, they simultaneously ought <em>not</em> to
                    swing to the other extreme as well. Put simply, courts are not – and ought
                    to not act as if they are – “mini-legislatures”. With
                    respect, the Judge should have tried to discern Parliament’s intention
                    from the provisions as a whole and their context instead of focusing on other
                    parts of the same provisions (see the Judgment at [15]–[16]). In so
                    doing, the Judge had <em>superimposed</em> a meaning on the
                    relevant statutory language which Parliament had never intended. That having
                    been said, the <em>legislative</em> intention or purpose
                    that the phrase “nullity of marriage” encompasses <em>both</em> void <em>and</em> voidable
                    marriages is made <em>even clearer</em> by, <em>inter alia</em>, the <em>legislative
                        background</em> as well. And it is to that background that our
                    attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     However, before proceeding to do so, we should
                    observe that a similar approach has been adopted in England in so far as the
                    phrase “nullity of marriage” is concerned. Put simply, <em>no</em> distinction is read into this phrase between void
                    marriages on the one hand and voidable marriages on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We note first that, in so far as the <em>division of matrimonial assets</em> is concerned, there is no
                    direct UK equivalent of s 112 of the Act. However, it bears noting that the
                    UK provisions dealing with the division of matrimonial assets throughout the
                    years (the latest of which are ss 23 and 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act
                    1973 (c 18) (UK) (“the 1973 UK Act”)) <em>have always </em><em>encompassed situations relating
                        to nullity of marriage as well</em>. More importantly, English case
                    law has consistently recognised the availability of ancillary relief even in the
                    context of <em>void</em> marriages (see, for example, the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Rampal v Rampal
                        (No 2)</em> [2002] 1 Fam 85 (“<em>Rampal</em>”) which was, in fact, cited to this court by
                    counsel for the Appellant (we note, parenthetically, that <em>Rampal</em> was also followed in the Hong Kong Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>L v C</em> [2007] 3 HKLRD 819, a case
                    involving bigamy, where the court held that, under s 6 of the Hong Kong
                    Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance (Cap 192) (HK), the same
                    right to ancillary relief as applies in a divorce applies where a decree of
                    nullity is obtained (at [96])). Incidentally, the court in <em>Rampal</em> was primarily concerned with whether the doctrine of
                        <em>ex turpi </em><em>causa non oritur
                        </em><em>actio</em> precluded a bigamist from
                    seeking ancillary relief under the 1973 UK Act. The court held that there
                    was no blanket rule that precludes a bigamist from being entitled to seek
                    ancillary relief (<em>Rampal</em> at [27]). We express no opinion on this aspect of
                    the decision, which is beyond the scope of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In so far as <em>maintenance
                        for the wife</em> is concerned, we note that s 1(1) of the UK
                    Matrimonial Causes Act 1907 (c 12) (UK) (“the 1907 UK Act”)
                    permitted the court to make an order for such maintenance in situations of
                        <em>nullity of marriage</em> as well. As a learned
                    author observed (correctly in our view), this particular provision manifested
                    “[t]he same tendency to treat void and voidable marriages as if they were
                    valid marriages that had been dissolved” (see E J Cohn,
                    “The Nullity of Marriage – A Study in Comparative Law and Legal
                    Reform” (1948) 64 LQR 324 at p 327). This is significant
                    in the local context because s 1 of the 1907 UK Act is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 113 of
                    the Act. Indeed, the English courts have also interpreted the phrase
                    “nullity of marriage” in s 1 of the 1907 UK Act as referring
                    to <em>both</em> void <em>and</em>
                    voidable marriages (see <em>Ramsay v Ramsay (otherwise
                        Beer)</em> [1913] 108 LT 382 (“<em>Ramsay</em>”); reference may also be made to <em>Rampal</em>, cited in the preceding paragraph, as well as the
                    Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce, <em>Report
                        1951–1955</em> (Cmd 9678, 1956) (“the <em>1951–1955 Report</em>”), especially at
                    para 516 (“[w]here the marriage is ended by divorce <em>or annulment</em> we think that the court should have
                        <em>the widest possible discretion</em> as to the kind
                    of financial provision it can order one spouse to make for the other.”
                    [emphasis added]). Incidentally, the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>George Hubert </em><em>Powell v Viola M
                        Cockburn</em> [1977] 2 SCR 218 has also held (at 236–237)
                    that a party to a void marriage was entitled to seek maintenance under s 1
                    of the Matrimonial Causes Act (RSO 1970, c 265) (Ont) (this provision
                    also used the phrase “nullity of marriage”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The legislative background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The background to the original Bill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is interesting to note that when the Bill
                    in which the legislative precursors to ss 112 and 113 were first introduced
                    (via the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Act 1980 (Act 26 of 1980)
                    (“the 1980 Amendment Act”)) was first presented to
                    Parliament, <em>both</em> clauses concerned did <em>not</em> contain the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage”. Indeed, a perusal of the <em>Comparative
                        Table</em> attached to the Bill reveals why this was so (see the
                    Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 23/79) (“the
                    1980 Bill”) at p 45 as well as the <em>Explanatory Statement</em> at pp 39–40). In particular,
                    the respective provisions were based, as the <em>Comparative
                        Table</em> clearly states, on the corresponding provisions in the
                        <em>Malaysian</em> Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce)
                    Act 1976 (Act 164 of 1976) (Malaysia) (“the Malaysian Act”). An
                    excellent account of the history of the Malaysian Act has been given elsewhere
                    (see B C Crown, “Property Division on Dissolution of Marriage”
                    (1988) 30 Mal LR 34 (“<em>Crown</em>”)
                    at pp 37-41). What is crucial for the purposes of the present judgment,
                    however, is the fact that the relevant provisions in the Malaysian Act did
                        <em>not</em> contain the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage” (see ss 76 and 77 of the Malaysian Act which relate to the
                    division of matrimonial assets and the power for the court to order maintenance
                    of a spouse, respectively) and that this was <em>also
                        reflected</em> in the 1980 Bill which, as just noted, drew upon
                    the aforementioned provisions of the Malaysian Act. It is clear, in our view,
                    that the Malaysian Parliament <em>intended</em> to
                        <em>exclude </em><em>nullity of marriage
                        </em><em>(whether involving void or voidable marriages)
                        from the purview of ss 76 and 77 of the Malaysian Act</em> (see
                    also the <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Non-Muslim
                        Marriage and Divorce Laws</em> (Kuala Lumpur, 1971) (“the
                        <em>Malaysian Royal Commission Report</em>”) at
                    p 57 and Ahmad Ibrahim, “The Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Bill,
                    1975” [1975] JMCL 354 at p 360 (also published in [1975]
                    2 MLJ lxix at lxxi); though <em>cf</em> Mimi
                    Kamariah Majid, <em>Family Law in Malaysia</em> (Malayan
                    Law Journal Sdn Bhd, 1999) at pp 329–330 (adopting an approach that
                    is not dissimilar to that adopted by the Judge in the court below in relation to
                    the issue of maintenance pursuant to s 77 of the Malaysian Act, but which,
                    with respect, is erroneous because, as explained above, it superimposes an
                    additional meaning that was not intended by the clear and unambiguous statutory
                    language)). <em>More importantly</em>, this was also the
                        <em>original intention</em> which was <em>embodied within the 1980 Bill in the Singapore context</em>.
                    On a related note, the fact that the Malaysian Parliament clearly intended
                    – particularly when viewed in <em>context
                        –</em> to exclude <em>all</em> forms of
                        <em>nullity of marriage</em> from the purview of
                    ss 76 and 77 of the Malaysian Act buttresses our view (set out above and
                    based on the clear and unambiguous statutory language) that, by <em>subsequently inserting</em> the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage” into the corresponding provisions in the Act, the Singapore
                    Parliament must have not only intended to <em>reverse</em>
                    its previous decision to adopt the Malaysian position but must have also
                        <em>intended to include nullity of marriage in all its
                        forms</em> (<em>viz</em>, as encompassing both
                    void as well as voidable marriages).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, the relevant background as to why the
                    Singapore Parliament ultimately inserted, <em>contrary</em>
                    to its original intention as reflected in the 1980 Bill (which followed the
                    Malaysian position in excluding nullity of marriage from the scope of both the
                    division of matrimonial assets as well as the power of the court to order
                    maintenance for the wife), the phrase “nullity of marriage” in the
                    relevant Singapore provisions lends <em>further
                        support</em> to the construction we have adopted of this phrase with
                    regard to both ss 112 and 113 of the Act. We refer, in particular, to
                        <em>the proceedings before the Select Committee</em>,
                    which took place between the promulgation of the 1980 Bill and the ultimate
                    enactment of the 1980 Amendment Act by the Singapore Parliament. The 1980
                    Amendment Act adopted the suggestions of the Select Committee<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before turning to consider the Select
                    Committee proceedings, we pause to note – parenthetically – that the
                    provisions that were introduced via the 1980 Amendment Act were (at least
                    in so far as <em>the division of matrimonial assets</em>
                    was concerned) <em>not the same as</em> the <em>current</em> provisions. In particular, the
                    1980 Amendment Act introduced s 106 of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Rev Ed”). That
                    particular provision was subsequently amended via the Women’s Charter
                    (Amendment) Act 1996 (Act 30 of 1996), which came into effect on 1 May
                    1997, and the resultant provision is (including some very minor amendments
                    pursuant to the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 2) Act 2005
                    (Act 42 of 2005)) identical in all respects to the provision that is the
                    subject of the present appeal in so far as the division of matrimonial assets is
                    concerned, <em>viz</em>, s 112 of the Act. However,
                    what <em>is</em> the same (and this is crucial for the
                    purposes of the present appeal) is that <em>both</em>
                    s 106 of the 1985 Rev Ed <em>as well as</em>
                    s 112 of the (present) Act contain the phrase “nullity of
                    marriage”. Hence, the analysis contained in the present judgment would
                    apply <em>equally</em> to <em>both</em> these provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Proceedings before the Select Committee</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Prof Leong’s paper</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is useful to begin our consideration of the
                    Select Committee proceedings with a paper that was presented to the Select
                    Committee by a leading academic in the field. In this paper, a number of points
                    were raised by Prof Leong Wai Kum (“Prof Leong”). The
                    one that is germane to the present appeal relates to her suggestions with regard
                    to the omission in the 1980 Bill of petitions of nullity in relation to the

                    provision for the wife (a point noted above at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>). In her view (see <em>Report of the Select

                            omission is <em>unfortunate because the existing statute

                                whenever they have felt it just. The Bill would thus be taking away
                                the right of a “wife” of an annulled marriage to
                                financial provision and a share of the family

                                a woman who is incapable of consummating her marriage (for which her
                                husband can obtain a decree of nullity) should be treated any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In a similar vein, Prof Leong observed
                    thus (in a legislative comment on the 1980 Bill in Leong Wai Kum, “A
                        <em>Turning Point</em> in Singapore Family Law:
                    Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill 1979” (1979) 21 Mal LR

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A <em>grave omission</em> of the Bill is that the
                        grant of decrees of <em>nullity</em> is <em>not</em> included in these provisions which empower the
                        court to divide family assets and to order support payments for the
                        wife’s benefit. The Act allows the court to do so; it is most
                        undesirable that this power be removed. <em>Whether the
                            family unit is disintegrated pursuant to the grant of a decree of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The point made by the learned author is even
                    clearer in the passage just quoted. Indeed, her focus is – rightly, if we
                    may say so – on the substance (as opposed to the form) of the matter. And
                    it is that the family unit can disintegrate in at least two main ways, <em>viz</em>, by divorce or through a petition for nullity. The
                    main point of substance, however, is <em>precisely</em>
                    that the family unit has in fact <em>disintegrated</em>,
                    and <em>that</em> constitutes the <em>commonality</em> between the parties, <em>which ought
                        (in fairness) to be addressed</em>. Once this is admitted, it is
                    clear, in our view, that the Singapore Parliament <em>had
                        appropriately added the phrase “nullity of marriage” (although
                        absent in the 1980 Bill)</em>, inter alia<em>,
                        into ss 112 and 113 of the Act.</em> Indeed, we would add that,
                    to achieve the full purpose of providing for <em>all</em>
                    concerned in the event of the <em>disintegration of the family
                        unit</em> (for <em>whatever reason</em>), the
                    phrase “nullity of marriage” which was ultimately inserted into
                    ss 112 and 113 of the Act <em>must</em> be given
                        <em>its plain meaning</em> (<em>viz</em>, that <em>both</em> void <em>as well as</em> voidable marriages are encompassed within the
                    meaning of, <em>inter alia</em>, ss 112 and 113 of the
                    Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The views by the same author in her textbook
                    ought also to be noted. Consistent with her views set out above, the learned
                    author argues that <em>ancillary relief</em> ought to be
                    available with regard to <em>void</em> marriages (see Leong
                    Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 2007) (“<em>Leong Wai Kum</em>”)
                    at p 76). She explains that although a judgment of nullity is conceptually
                    meaningless where a marriage is void <em>ab </em><em>initio</em>, obtaining such a judgment is useful in practice
                    because it allows the parties access to the court’s jurisdiction to order
                    ancillary relief (<em>ibid</em>). Prof Leong also
                    points out that there is no case law discussing whether the court’s
                    exercise of its ancillary powers should be “attenuated” where a
                    marriage is void, as compared to the more conventional situation of a
                    termination by divorce (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Although the reason for
                    Prof Leong’s view in her textbook is not immediately apparent in this
                    particular portion of her work, another part of the book may, however, provide
                    an explanation as to why parties to a void marriage should, in her view, be
                    entitled to ancillary relief (see <em>Leong Wai Kum</em> at
                    pp 40–44). Prof Leong explains that a distinction should be
                    drawn between a “non-marriage” and a “void marriage”
                    (see also Joseph Jackson, <em>The Formation and Annulment of
                        Marriage</em> (2nd Ed, Butterworths, 1969) (“<em>Jackson</em>”) at pp 85–86). She uses the
                    term “non-marriage” to refer to a situation where the parties have
                    no marital relationship <em>whatsoever</em> (the example
                    Prof Leong gives is a stranger coming up to a person and claiming that he is
                    married to her). In contrast, parties to a void marriage may have conducted
                    themselves as if the marriage was valid. Prof Leong proceeds to argue that
                    a workable distinction between “void marriages” and
                    “non-marriages” is that the former category of marriages fulfils
                    the fundamental contractual requirements of marriage: <em>viz</em>, there must be credible evidence of an exchange of a mutual
                    intention to marry (see <em>Leong Wai Kum</em> at
                    p 41). In our view, Prof Leong’s argument is persuasive and
                    constitutes an answer to any conceptual difficulties that may arise in holding
                    that a void marriage has legal consequences.</p>

                                            something has gone wrong. Finally they go to court and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The above extract demonstrates that the
                    committee had intended the phrase “nullity of marriage” in the
                    predecessor provisions to both ss 112 and 113 of the Act to allow the
                    courts the <em>discretion</em> to order division of
                    matrimonial assets and maintenance in void marriages as well. In
                    particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     In relation to the division of
                        matrimonial assets, the members appear to have been persuaded by
                        Dr Ahmad Mattar’s response (immediately after
                        Mr Selvadurai’s reference to a “null and <em>void</em> marriage” [emphasis added]) that assets
                        may have been acquired in a nullified marriage. It should be noted that it
                        does not appear that the members were using the word “void”
                        loosely. The members seem to have appreciated that a void marriage is one
                        that is void <em>ab </em><em>initio</em>. Indeed, Mr Selvadurai used the phrase
                        “void <em>ab </em><em>initio</em>” in one of his comments in the extract
                        above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     In so
                        far as the issue of maintenance is concerned, it appears that the majority
                        of the committee were satisfied with Mr Selvadurai’s explanation
                        that the court should have the discretion to order maintenance in void
                        marriages. Again, the members do not appear to be using the word
                        “void” loosely. In fact, Dr Augustine Tan (the sole
                        dissenter) referred to a situation of <em>bigamy</em>
                        in his attempt to convince the members that a man should not be responsible
                        for maintaining a bigamous wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     During the third reading of the Bill, the
                    amendments recommended by the Select Committee were accepted by Parliament
                    without any debate. There was only an introductory speech by Dr Ahmad
                    Mattar (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (25 June 1980) at cols 1458–1462, <em>per</em> Dr Ahmad Mattar, Acting Minister for Social
                    Affairs). Although there is no express mention in Dr Ahmad Mattar’s
                    speech of the deliberations of the Select Committee concerning the introduction
                    of the words “nullity of marriage” in the clauses that would
                    become the predecessor provisions to ss 112 and 113 of the Act, these
                    deliberations are nevertheless valuable in furnishing us with the relevant
                    background that confirms the interpretation we have adopted with regard to the
                    phrase “nullity of marriage” in ss 112 and 113 of the Act.
                    More importantly, it is both logical as well as reasonable to assume, in these
                    circumstances, that the Singapore Parliament must have <em>accepted</em> the changes proposed by the Select
                Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The historical background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We turn now to consider the historical
                    background to the distinction between void and voidable marriages. The purpose
                    of this exercise is to ascertain whether or not our interpretation of the term
                    “nullity of marriage” in ss 112 and 113 of the Act is
                    inconsistent with the historical rationales for the distinction between void and
                    voidable marriages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The origins of the distinction between void and voidable
                marriages in English law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The basic concept of nullity of marriage in
                    general and its specific elements of void and voidable marriages in particular
                    can in fact be traced historically back to the ecclesiastical courts in England
                    (see <em>per</em> Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the
                    House of Lords decision of <em>Ross Smith v Ross Smith</em>
                    [1963] AC 280 (“<em>Ross
                    Smith</em>”) at 313-314 and 317 as well as <em>Jackson</em>, especially at p 72). Indeed, the concept of
                    nullity of marriage arose as a result of the fact that the courts in England
                    could not then grant decrees of divorce because marriage was (at that particular
                    point in time) considered a sacrament, which (in turn) resulted in the
                    indissolubility of marriage (see, for example,
                    N V Lowe and G Douglas, <em>Bromley’s Family Law</em> (10th Ed, Oxford University
                    Press, 2007) (“<em>Lowe &amp; Douglas</em>”) at pp 67–68).
                    However, in addition to divorces <em>a mensa et thoro</em>
                    (or judicial separation), the courts could grant decrees of nullity instead in
                    order to mitigate the hardships engendered by the indissolubility of marriage
                    (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Adams v Adams</em> [1941] 1 KB 536 at 541, <em>per</em> Scott LJ and the Royal Commission on Divorce
                    and Matrimonial Causes, <em>Report of the Royal Commission on
                        Divorce and Matrimonial Causes</em> (Cd 6478, 1912) (“the
                        <em>1912 Report</em>”) at para 13)
                    – one practical (and desirable) result of which was that remarriage was
                    permitted during the lifetime of a spouse. As a leading legal historian aptly
                    put it, the ecclesiastical courts “could not break the chains, but they
                    could declare that the chains were never there” (see J H Baker,
                        <em>An Introduction to English Legal History</em>
                    (4th Ed, Butterworths, 2002) at p 491).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     How, then, did the distinction between void
                    and voidable marriages arise? The reasons for such a distinction are not wholly
                    clear, but it would appear that they were <em>historical</em> and arose as a result of a <em>tussle</em>, so to speak, between the royal courts on the one hand
                    and the ecclesiastical courts on the other. The following extract from a leading
                    English textbook on family law concisely explains this conflict (see <em>Lowe &amp; Douglas</em> at p 68):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By the beginning of the seventeenth century, however, the royal courts
                        were becoming concerned at the ease with which marriages could be set aside
                        and the issue bastardised. This was more likely to work injustice after the
                        parties’ death, when relevant evidence might no longer be available.
                        Accordingly, they <b><em>cut down</em></b> the ecclesiastical
                        courts’ jurisdiction by forbidding them to annul marriages in certain
                        cases after the death of either party. <b><em>This had the
                            result of dividing impediments into two kinds: civil and
                            canonical</em></b>. If the impediment was <b><em>civil</em></b> – for example, the fact that one of the parties
                        was married to a third person at the time of the ceremony – the
                        marriage was still <b><em>void ab initio </em></b><b><em>and its validity could be put in issue by anyone at any time,
                            whether or not the parties were still alive</em></b>. If the
                        impediment was <b><em>canonical</em></b> – for example,
                        the fact that one of the parties was impotent –
                        <b><em>the validity of the marriage could not be questioned
                            after either party had died. The rule thus developed that such a
                            marriage must be regarded as valid unless it was annulled during the
                            lifetime of both parties. Until that time it had the capacity to be
                            turned into a void marriage: in other words, it was </em></b><em>voidable</em>. [emphasis added in bold italics; emphasis

                    the distinction between void and voidable marriages turned on whether or not the
                    main issue was property – in which case the temporal courts would have
                    jurisdiction in the context of a void (as opposed to a voidable) marriage; this
                    view is not, we note, inconsistent with the observations of <em>Lowe &amp; Douglas</em> which have just been quoted above) and

                    note 14 (where the learned author furnished two reasons as to why the royal
                    courts interfered with the ecclesiastical courts’ power to declare some
                    marriages to be void: first, to protect the issue from being bastardised and
                    disinherited because they (<em>ie</em>, the issue) might
                    not be able to defend the marriage as well as the parties might have if they
                    were both alive; and second, the ecclesiastical courts were permitted to
                    separate parties to marriages suffering from canonical disabilities because such
                    marriages were considered to be sinful; however, after the death of one of the
                    parties, the royal courts would not permit the ecclesiastical courts to
                    interfere because any separation “could no longer contribute to the good
                    of their [<em>ie</em>, the parties’]
                    souls”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     After the passing of the Matrimonial Causes
                    Act 1857 (c 85) (UK) (“the 1857 UK Act”), the concept of
                    judicial divorce was introduced. However, the concept of nullity of marriage as
                    well as the distinction between void and voidable marriages remained. Indeed,
                    even prior to the 1857 UK Act, the distinction between void and voidable
                    marriages occasionally appeared even in statutes (see, for example, the Marriage
                    Act 1835 (c 54) (UK), as well as the observations by Lord Morris
                    in <em>Ross Smith</em> (at 316)). What is clear, however,
                    is that the distinction between void and voidable marriages was more a <em>historical</em> one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The legal significance of the distinction between void and
                voidable marriages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     That having been said, it cannot be doubted
                    that, in so far as <em>consequences</em> are concerned,
                    distinguishing between void and voidable marriages does have <em>legal</em> significance, especially where <em>third
                        parties</em> are concerned (see also <em>Lowe &amp; Douglas</em> at pp 70–71). As, for
                    example, Lord Greene put it in the following (and oft-cited) passage in the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>De Reneville v De
                        Reneville</em> [1948] P 100 (at 111):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] void marriage is one that will be regarded by every court in
                        any case in which the existence of the marriage is in issue as never having
                        taken place and can be so treated by both parties to it without the
                        necessity of any decree annulling it: a voidable marriage is one that will
                        be regarded by every court as a valid subsisting marriage until a decree
                        annulling it has been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     What this means is that, in so far as
                        <em>void</em> marriages are concerned, <em>third parties</em> who <em>have a proper
                        interest </em><em>in the matter</em> can rely on
                    the fact that the marriage concerned is void in order to help make out their
                    case against the other party or parties. Where, however, the marriage is only
                        <em>voidable</em>, the right to raise the fact that the
                    marriage concerned is voidable is <em>personal</em> to the
                    parties <em>only</em> and can only be raised <em>during the lifetime of the other spouse</em> (see, for
                    example, the English High Court decisions of <em>A v B and
                        Another</em> (1868) LR 1 P&amp;D 559 at 561-562, <em>per</em> Sir J P Wilde and <em>Fowke v Fowke</em> [1938] 1 Ch 774 at 781, <em>per</em> Farwell J; the English Court of Appeal

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The origins of the grounds for nullity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It would be useful to note the historical
                    origins of the grounds for nullity. It appears that the grounds upon which a
                    decree of nullity could be granted after the 1857 UK Act were already
                    relatively satisfactory. However, further grounds were added, statutorily, via
                    s 7 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 (c 57) (UK) (“the
                    1937 UK Act”), giving effect to the recommendations of the <em>1912 Report</em> (these grounds rendering the marriage
                    voidable (see also <em>Jackson</em> at pp 75 and
                    97–98 as well as the <em>1951–1955 Report</em>, especially at para 25)). These
                    grounds also comprise, in the <em>Singapore</em> context,
                    what is presently ss 106(<em>b</em>), (<em>c</em>) (as modified after the 1971 UK developments, see
                    below at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>–<a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>), (<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the Act (see below at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>). Indeed, and returning to the English position, although
                    there was a further landmark statutory amendment in 1971, the <em>statutory grounds</em> as we know them today (in Singapore as well)
                    were – subject to one significant exception which will be discussed in a
                    moment – settled, in the main, circa 1937.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is also interesting to note that statutory
                    grounds <em>for nullity of marriage</em> existed in the
                        <em>local</em> context <em>as far back
                        as 1910.</em> In particular, s 14 of the Straits Settlements
                    Divorce Ordinance 1910 (Ordinance 25 of 1910) (“the

                    void and which rendered the marriage voidable (for the present law, see

                    confirmed by the <em>Objects and Reasons</em> to the Bill
                    upon which the 1910 Ordinance was based, where it was stated thus (see the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Indian Act referred to above appears to be
                    the Divorce Act  (Act 4 of 1869) (India), in particular, s 19
                    (with which s 14 of the 1910 Ordinance (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>) appears to be identical save that s 19
                    omits the grounds for nullity found in ss 14(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the
                    1910 Ordinance). Of relevance, too, is the annotation to this Act in
                        <em>The Unrepealed General Acts of the Governor General in
                        Council – From 1868 to 1878, both inclusive</em>, vol II

                    p 5, note 1, which reads as follows:</p>

                        Lord Penzance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There were, in fact, <em>further</em> amendments in the <em>local</em>
                    context to the 1910 Ordinance. Section 6 of the Straits Settlements Divorce
                    (Amendment No 2) Ordinance 1941 (Ordinance 25 of 1941), for example,
                    amended s 14 (then numbered as s 13) of the 1910 Ordinance (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>) to incorporate the new
                    grounds of nullity of marriage that were introduced in the English context by
                    the 1937 UK Act (see above at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>).
                    The law in Singapore in relation to the various grounds of nullity remained the
                    same thereafter as those in the English context and were, in fact, re-enacted in
                    the Women’s Charter when that statute was first promulgated (see the
                        <em>Explanatory Statement</em> to the Women’s
                    Charter Bill (Bill No 67 of 1960) in the <em>State of
                        Singapore Government Gazette Supplement </em><em>1960</em> (17 March 1960) at p 361), which remained the law
                    in Singapore until the 1980 Amendment Act which, whilst ostensibly based on
                    the Malaysian Act, was in substance based on the English position after the
                    enactment of the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 (c 44) (UK) (“the
                    1971 UK Act”). Indeed, it is clear that the relevant provisions in
                    the Malaysian Act themselves had “[adopted] the recommendations of the
                    England and Wales Law Commission’s Report on Nullity of Marriage”
                    (see the <em>Malaysian Royal Commission Report</em> at
                    p 56). It is to these developments in the English context that our
                    attention now briefly turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     There was, as mentioned above, a major review
                    undertaken by the Law Commission for England and Wales that resulted in the
                    1971 UK Act (see generally the Law Commission, <em>Working
                        Paper – Nullity of Marriage</em> (Working Paper No 20,
                    1968) and the Law Commission, <em>Family Law – Report on
                        Nullity of Marriage</em> (Law Com No 33, 1970) (“the
                        <em>1970 Report</em>”), as well as the
                    helpful commentaries (on the latter) by Stephen Cretney, “The Nullity of
                    Marriage Act 1971” (1972) 35 MLR 57 and J C Hall,
                    “The Nullity of Marriage Act 1971” [1971] CLJ 208). The relevant
                    provisions (later consolidated as part of the 1973 UK Act) do form, in
                    fact, the basis of our current provisions in the Act on nullity of marriage. The
                    1971 UK Act also clarified the law pursuant to suggestions in the <em>1970 Report</em> –
                    <em>inter alia</em>, by making it clear that a lack of
                    consent ought to render the marriage concerned voidable as well as making it
                    clear that the effect of a decree of nullity of marriage was to be prospective
                    inasmuch as the marriage concerned would end as from the date of the decree
                    absolute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Our interpretation of ss 112 and 113 of the Act is not
                inconsistent with the historical rationale for the distinction between void and
                voidable marriages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The historical background to the law on
                    nullity of marriages tells us that despite the difference in <em>legal consequences </em>between void and voidable marriages,
                    there is in fact nothing in the origins of the concept of nullity of marriages
                    that justifies – in point of general principle and/or logic – the
                    conclusion that, in construing s 112 of the Act, a division of matrimonial
                    assets ought only to be effected in relation to voidable marriages, but not in
                    relation to void marriages. In this regard, we find persuasive the analysis and
                    logic of Prof Leong set out above (at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>). We also note the observation of Lord Hodson in
                        <em>Ross Smith</em> (at 329) that “[w]hether the
                    marriage is void or voidable the question to be determined is always the same,
                    that is to say, was it or was it not a valid marriage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As we have noted above (at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), the distinction between void and voidable
                    marriages arose from a <em>historical</em> tussle which
                    resulted, in turn, in a “division” between civil and canonical
                    jurisdictions – a “division” that is no longer relevant
                    today. <em>However</em>, the rationale for, as well as the
                    result of, such a “division” was not an incoherent one. In
                    particular, <em>civil</em> impediments were those which
                    went to <em>the very formation</em> of the marriage itself
                    and, from the perspective of a “division” of jurisdiction, were
                    appropriate for the <em>civil</em> sphere as they related
                    (in the main) to impediments that were more <em>formal</em>
                    in nature (see also the observation in a leading work that “[t]he real
                    distinction is not so much between a void marriage and a voidable marriage as
                    between a void <em>ceremony</em> and a voidable
                    marriage” (see <em>Jackson</em> at
                    pp 84–85 [emphasis added]; see also <em>Tolstoy</em> at pp 385–386). Reference may also be made to
                        <em>Leong</em> at p 588 (“The law of
                        <b><em>solemnisation</em></b> of marriage would not be
                    complete if there were no sanctions for its breach. The most serious sanction is
                    that the result is a void marriage, <em>ie</em>, a union
                    that lacks legal validity. It will not be possible to ensure due compliance with
                    the statutory requirements of the law of <b><em>solemnisation</em></b> if not for this most serious sanction for
                    breach” [emphasis added in bold italics; emphasis in italics in
                    original]) and <em>Ong</em> at p 278). And, from the
                    perspective of <em>legal result</em>, treating marriages
                    that do not comply with the requirements for solemnisation as <em>void</em> (as opposed to <em>being</em>
                    voidable) was also both logical and commonsensical. Hence, where the very
                        <em>ceremony</em> itself was flawed, there was
                    justification in treating the marriage itself as being <em>void
                        ab </em><em>initio</em> – as being fatally
                    flawed, so to speak, right from <em>its outset</em>. So,
                    also, there was similar justification in treating the marriage concerned as
                    being <em>void ab </em><em>initio</em>
                    where one of the parties was <em>already married</em> at
                    the time the marriage purportedly took place. Indeed, legal impediments of this
                    nature <em>are now embodied, statutorily, within
                        </em><em>s 105 of the Act</em> (which
                    encompasses not only invalid ceremonies of marriage but also other formal
                    matters such as non-age and prohibited degrees). Section 105 of the Act
                    itself reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Grounds on which marriage is
                            void</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>105.</b>  A marriage which takes place after 1st June 1981
                        shall be void on the following grounds only:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) that it is not a valid marriage
                            by virtue of sections 3(4), 5, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 22; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) where the marriage
                            was celebrated outside Singapore, that the marriage is
                            invalid —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) for lack of capacity; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) by the law of the place in which it was
                                celebrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>contrast</em>,
                    however, the <em>canonical</em> impediments, whilst
                    impacting the status of the marriage concerned, were nevertheless of a somewhat
                    different cast. In particular, none would be <em>necessarily</em> known at the time the parties entered into their
                    marriage and therefore would <em>not necessarily</em> go
                    towards the <em>formation</em> of the marriage as such (as
                    a learned author observed, “the grounds on which a marriage is voidable
                    may even be supervening causes, and none affect the validity of the marriage at
                    its inception” (see <em>Ong</em> at p 278)).
                    Looked at in this light, such impediments were, understandably,
                    “allotted” to the ecclesiastical courts (as opposed to the royal
                    courts). Hence, for example, where the marriage cannot be consummated owing to
                    the incapacity of one party or to the refusal by one party to consummate the
                    marriage, or where there is some other incapacity on the part of one of the
                    parties (such as the absence of valid consent, the presence of mental disorder
                    or venereal disease of a communicable nature, or being pregnant by some person
                    other than the petitioner), the marriage concerned is rendered null and void
                        <em>only at the option of the petitioner </em><em>once he or she is aware of the impediment concerned</em>, not
                    least because, as just mentioned, these impediments will <em>not
                        necessarily</em> go towards the <em>formation</em> of the marriage. Significantly, once again, this
                    particular situation is <em>in fact embodied, statutorily, within
                        </em><em>s 106 </em><em>of
                        the Act.</em> Section 106 of the Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Grounds on which marriage is
                            voidable</b>
</p>

                        1981 shall be voidable on the following grounds only:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) that the marriage has not been
                            consummated owing to the incapacity of either party to consummate

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) that the marriage has not been

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>) that either party to the

                            duress, mistake, mental disorder or otherwise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>d</em>) that at the time of the
                            marriage either party, though capable of giving a valid consent, was
                            suffering (whether continuously or intermittently) from mental disorder
                            within the meaning of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2008 of
                            such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>e</em>) that at the time of the
                            marriage the defendant was suffering from venereal disease in a

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>f</em>) that at the time of the
                            marriage the defendant was pregnant by some person other than the
                            plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     However, it is important to emphasise a point
                    alluded to earlier – that there is nothing in the analysis in the
                    preceding two paragraphs which militates against permitting the court to divide
                    the matrimonial assets between the parties in the situation of a <em>void</em> marriage (as opposed to a <em>voidable</em> marriage). Hence, <em>even the
                        historical background</em> does <em>not</em>
                    detract from the construction of s 112 of the Act that we have adopted in
                    the present judgment. And we would add that there is <em>also</em> no reason in principle why the court should not be given
                    the power (pursuant to s 113 of the Act) to award the wife maintenance even
                    in the situation of a <em>void</em> marriage (again, as
                    opposed to a <em>voidable</em> marriage).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     We now turn to consider – in the
                    briefest of fashions – why general policy and principle <em>also support</em> the construction that we have adopted with regard
                    to ss 112 and 113 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General policy and principle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We have, in fact, already touched on why the
                    construction we have adopted is consistent with the general policy underlying
                    the division of matrimonial assets as well as of maintenance to the wife
                    pursuant to ss 112 and 113, respectively, of the Act. To recapitulate,
                    there is nothing in the historical development of the law relating to nullity of
                    marriage which militates against the courts being granted the powers in these
                    specific areas. It is therefore not surprising that the Singapore Parliament
                    intentionally conferred these powers, which were in fact absent in the 1980
                    Bill, by the insertion of references to “nullity of marriage” in
                    the respective provisions. That this was a deliberate and intentional act by
                    Parliament has already been demonstrated by reference to the relevant materials
                    (in particular, the Select Committee proceedings).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Turning to the approach from <em>principle</em>, it also seems to us that, in so far as the
                    division of matrimonial assets is concerned, there is – having regard to
                    the broad brush approach which has been well-established by the relevant local
                    case law – a strong case to be made out in favour of treating s 112
                    of the Act as covering the entire spectrum of nullity (<em>viz</em>, both voidable <em>as well as</em> void
                    marriages). Put simply, there is sufficient flexibility within the broad brush
                    approach so that, in the situation of a <em>void</em>
                    marriage in which the factual circumstances are such as to make it just and
                    equitable that a particular spouse be given a low or (in extreme circumstances
                    such as where the marriage is an exceedingly short one) little or no proportion
                    of the matrimonial assets. This is, of course, wholly consistent with the broad
                    brush approach just mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Secondly, if the approach of the Judge in the
                    court below is adopted, there is nothing precluding the spouse in a <em>void</em> marriage to nevertheless have recourse to <em>the general law</em> (a point that was also referred to by
                    the Judge himself (see the Judgment at [15]). We do not see how this can improve either the efficiency
                    or quality of justice on both a general level and as between the parties. From
                    the perspective of principle, the broad brush approach adopted in s 112 of
                    the Act with a view towards the attainment of a just and equitable distribution
                    of matrimonial assets between the parties is the most appropriate one,
                    particularly when viewed in the matrimonial context, and (more importantly for
                    the purposes of this appeal) is eminently suitable with respect to <em>void</em> marriages as well as voidable
                marriages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It is clear, from <em>every</em> aspect (<em>viz</em>, legislative
                    intention, logic, language, history as well as general policy and principle),
                    that the phrase “nullity of marriage” in ss 112 and 113 of
                    the Act encompasses <em>both</em> void <em>and</em> voidable marriages. It followed from our decision (and as
                    the Appellant had submitted) that the case should be remitted to the second
                    District Judge to decide the issues of both the division of matrimonial assets
                    as well as that of maintenance on their merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For all these reasons, we allowed the appeal
                    with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
