        This is a limited appeal. The plaintiff is

appealing against such part of my decision made on 15 August 2002 as decided that there be

a stay on the judgment sum of $580,782 and that the costs of the Registrar’s Appeal

No. 175 of 2002 be in the cause. On 17 July 2002 the Senior Assistant Registrar ordered

that final judgment in favour of the plaintiffs be entered against the defendants in the

sum of $580,782 with costs fixed at $4,000. But he granted unconditional leave to the

defendants to defend the balance of the claims, in the amount of $566,958.62.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        In ordering a stay of execution of the judgment

sum of $580,782 I exercised the discretion conferred on me by Order 14 Rule 3(2) of the

Rules of Court, 1997 Ed. ("the Rules") which provides that in summary judgment

proceedings "the Court may by order, and subject to such conditions, if any, as may

be just, stay execution of any judgment… until after the trial of any counterclaim

made or raised by the defendant in the action".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        In Sheppards &amp; Co v Wilkinson &amp; Jarvis

(1889) 6 T.L.R. 13 the Master of the Rolls said:-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"There might be either a

    defence to the Claim which was plausible, or there might be a counterclaim pure and

    simple. To shut out such a counterclaim if there was any substance in it would be an

    autocratic and violent use of Order XIV. The Court has no power to try such a counterclaim

    on such an application, but if they thought it so far plausible that it was not

    unreasonably possible for it to succeed if brought to trial, it ought not to be

    excluded."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        Lindley L.J. in the same case was reported to

have said "The counterclaim was by no means frivolous, and the defendants ought not

to be shut out from trying it".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The discretion was exercised against the

following background. In March 2001 Comfort Resources Pte Ltd ("the Employers")

engaged the defendants as main contractors for the erection of a part single and part

three storey building at No. 51 Shipyard Road, Singapore ("the Shipyard Road

project"). By an agreement dated 13 September 2001 ("the Agreement") the

defendants engaged the plaintiffs as their sub-contractors to complete the Shipyard

project for the lump sump of $1,895,250.00. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        When defendants were paid against

architects’ certificates for the work done and materials supplied, defendants would

in turn pay the plaintiffs less 5% for retention monies and 5% for the defendants’

profit and attendance. In this action, the plaintiffs claimed against defendants the sum

of $1,147,740.62. The claim was readily admitted by the defendants but the defendants

asserted that they had set-offs and counterclaims against the plaintiffs which would

extinguish and exceed the claims of the plaintiffs. In respect of the Shipyard Road

project, it was common ground that the plaintiffs had, in turn, sub-contracted certain

works of the Shipyard Road project back to the defendants. The defendants specialized in

steel modular formwork and the plaintiffs engaged them to carry out those works and some

aspects of the Shipyard Road project. The fact that the defendants had carried out work

and supplied materials were not controverted; only the quantum payable and whether there

were defective works were questions and allegations raised by the plaintiffs. For the

purposes of this limited appeal, it should be noted that it is no longer a live issue that

the defendants had raised an arguable case for an equitable set-off and the amount to be

set-off against the plaintiffs claims is $566,958.62.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        It is also common ground that the plaintiffs

had engaged the defendants to carry building works and supply materials in two other

projects known as The Tuas Avenue Project and the Limau project. The defendants had also

carried out Day Works, most of which were done at the two projects, plus Day Works carried

out elsewhere at the request of the plaintiffs. The defendants asserted that their claims

for these other work done and materials supplied, which had nothing to do with the

Shipyard Road Project totaled $758,162.39. These were claims made bona fide and they are

plausible. As the claims stood, these set-offs would if successful overtop the balance of

the claims of the plaintiffs which stood at $566,958.62 for which conditional leave to

defend was given.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        I should at once note that the plaintiffs,

whilst admitting that the defendants had done work and supplied materials for their

account in the two projects and other Day Works, strenuously disputed that these were

liquidated claims. In any case, they asserted counterclaims against the defendants for

serious defects, particularly in the Limau project, for which the defendants were liable.

For those two reasons, the plaintiffs disputed that the defendants had any enforceable

legal set-offs to assert against the claims of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        I now set out the reasons which persuaded me to

order the stay of execution and to hold over the question of the cost of the appeal before

me to be decided by the trial judge. First, it was evident that both parties had been

carrying out work for and supplying materials to each other. On top of that, they had in

effect been maintaining a very loose and informal running account, setting off or

deducting each other’s claims. The accounting for the Shipyard Road project was

relatively straightforward in that payments were only due against architects’

certificates. There was no such certification for the other works in the Tuas Avenue

project and the Limau Project. The plaintiffs had not taken legal action until the filing

of this action because the defendants had been carrying out work for and supplying

materials to them. In the result, there developed the situation that the plaintiffs had a

credit claim of $566,982.62<b> </b>in respect the Shipyard Road project but there is a

credible cross claim of $758,162.39. In the event that the plaintiff failed in their

claims for the balance and if the defendants succeeds in their claims for the other three

separate transactions, then the defendants would have a judgment which would more than

cancel out the judgment sum. Not to have ordered a stay would have severely disrupted the

previous management of their respective claims against the other which they had put in

place and operated for months before the commencement of this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        Secondly, in addition to maintaining the de

factor status quo between the parties so far as settling their respective accounts were

concerned, I did not think that the plaintiffs would suffer any significant prejudice if a

stay was ordered. The prosecution of their claims could be expeditiously done and their

case could come on very quickly. It was not likely that the defendants could delay matters

in the light of the present efficient case management in our court system. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        Thirdly, the enforcement of the judgment could

cause severe disruptions to the business of the defendants. The plaintiffs had allowed

their claims to accumulate to the huge sum of $1,147,740.62. The defendants asserted that

the reason why no action was taken by the plaintiffs was because the defendants had

carried out for them and supplied to them materials in the other two projects, in addition

to the Day Works which were ordered by the plaintiffs from time to time. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Having considered these reasons and the overall

impression of the respective claims, I made the orders I did. </font></p>
