<p class="Judg-Author">
        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd, is a
                    shipping company that went into liquidation. The liquidation initially began as
                    a voluntary liquidation but Galsworthy Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Galsworthy”), who was a major creditor of the plaintiff took
                    over the liquidation and appointed the present liquidators in place of the ones
                    nominated by the plaintiff in its initial voluntary winding up
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first and second defendants are husband and
                    wife. They come from Hong Kong although they now have Singapore identity cards.
                    The third defendant is their son. The fourth defendant is a friend of the third
                    defendant and was from China but he too now carries a Singapore identity card.
                    The third and fourth defendants took over the plaintiff from the first and
                    second defendants on 22 December 2008. The fifth and sixth defendants are
                    companies owned by the first, second and third defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Galsworthy commenced arbitration proceedings
                    against the plaintiff and on 31 August 2010 received the arbitration award
                    in its favour. The arbitrators then delivered the second award on quantum on
                    13 May 2011 awarding a sum of US$45m to Galsworthy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff (in liquidation) commenced
                    proceedings in this suit against the defendant on 23 April 2014 and on the
                    same day applied by summons for a freezing order against the defendants. The
                    summons was served on the plaintiff on 25 April 2014 and on 29 April
                    2014 the parties appeared before me. I granted an interim injunction pending the
                        <em>inter partes</em> hearing of the summons. The
                    defendants were represented by counsel at the 29 April 2014 proceedings.
                    The parties returned on 27 October 2014 before me for the <em>inter parte</em> arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Kenneth Lim, counsel for the plaintiff
                    submitted that there is a sum of $635,000 (which was from the proceeds of sale
                    of the plaintiff’s last remaining vessels) now deposited with JLC Advisors
                    LLP, the solicitors for the third and fourth defendants, as stakeholders. The
                    first and second defendants also own 2G Bishope Gate, a house valued between $30
                    to $40 million. The plaintiff fears that these assets might be dissipated and
                    thus prays that the court orders an injunction against the defendants enjoining
                    them from disposing of the assets. Mr Lim submitted that there is a real
                    risk of dissipation on the basis of the defendants’ conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Lim submitted that when he appeared for the
                    plaintiff in an <em>ex parte</em> hearing on 29 April
                    2014, Mr Sim Chong appeared for the fifth and sixth defendants and informed
                    the court that there were still four vessels belonging to the fifth defendant.
                    However, unknown to the plaintiff and, it seems the fifth defendant’s
                    counsel at the time, one of the four vessels had already been sold and the fifth
                    defendant was in the process of selling the other three vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Sim Chong defended the fifth
                    defendant’s position, submitting that the vessels were not sold suddenly
                    or surreptitiously, but gradually and openly over several years. He submitted
                    that the plaintiff’s liquidators had interviewed the directors and did not
                    act until they filed this writ. Mr Kenneth Lim responded by stating that
                    they filed the writ and the application promptly enough, as soon as they
                    realised that the defendants appear to dissipate the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As further indication of the dissipation of
                    assets, Mr Lim submitted the income earning contracts for vessel management
                    made between the plaintiff and companies controlled by the defendants were
                    cancelled. The management (and thus the income) of the vessels under contract
                    were thus diverted from the plaintiff to the six defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Siraj Omar, counsel for the third and
                    fourth defendants, made a strenuous and spirited argument against this
                    application. He submitted that the sale of the vessels and the cancellation of
                    the ship management contracts were all part of the legitimate decision to
                    restructure the companies within the group. He pointed out that the process
                    started before the Galsworthy arbitration. He submitted that the third defendant
                    is a reputable businessman from Hong Kong, and that both the third and fourth
                    defendants have been cooperating fully with the liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendants’ collective position is
                    that the individual defendants are reputable persons and the disposal of assets
                    was part of a group re-structuring process. Therefore, it was argued, there is
                    no reason to find that the defendants were dissipating assets to the
                    plaintiff’s detriment. They also claimed that the plaintiff had taken too
                    long before commencing action and making this application. I am satisfied that
                    the delay was due to the lack of funds, and that the liquidators had acted with
                    sufficient diligence in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It seems that just looking at the chronology
                    of events, the action of the defendants, singularly and in concert, were carried
                    out with the intention of preventing Galsworthy from getting paid the arbitral
                    award that it had won against the plaintiff. The argument that all the transfers
                    of assets and contracts were part of a corporate restructuring does not seem
                    plausible. How would all these transfers help the group’s business
                    generally, and the plaintiff in particular? The answer seems obvious – to
                    prevent whatever that is left from going to Galsworthy. I am thus satisfied that
                    unless prevented, the assets of the plaintiff will be dissipated to the
                    detriment of Galsworthy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff’s application is therefore
                    allowed. The costs of this application shall be costs in the cause. The parties
                    have the liberty to apply.</p>
