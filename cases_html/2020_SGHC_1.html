(“Bloomberry”), and Sureste Properties, Inc (“Sureste”), the first and second plaintiffs in Originating Summons 1432 of 2017 (“OS 1432”), are challenging a Partial Award on liability issued by a three-member arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) on 20 September 2016. The first and second defendants in OS 1432 were the claimants in a Singapore-seated arbitration that was commenced in 2013 and governed by  the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Arbitration Rules 2010 (“the Arbitration”). The plaintiffs were the respondents in the Arbitration. The Tribunal found in favour of the first and second defendants, Global Gaming Philippines LLC (“GGAM”), and GGAM Netherlands B.V. (“GGAM Netherlands”) respectively, for wrongful termination of the Management Services Agreement dated 9 September 2011 (“the MSA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By the Partial Award, the Tribunal found, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there were no misrepresentations by the defendants that induced the plaintiffs to enter into the MSA. The Tribunal noted that to justify rescission of the MSA on account of causal fraud under Philippines Law, the fraud must be serious, and must have operated at the time of the making of the MSA. In addition, evidence of fraud must be “full, clear and convincing” (see [127] of the Partial Award). The Tribunal also held that the plaintiffs’ grounds for termination of the MSA were not made out and thus, their purported termination of the MSA was wrongful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In OS 1432, the plaintiffs refer to evidence of fraud and/or corruption, which they assert were not discoverable until months <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Partial Award was issued on 20 September 2016. The argument here as regards the basis of the fraud allegations is that evidence was adduced in the Arbitration by the defendants which has now been shown to be false – not merely in the sense that it was incorrect, but in the sense that it was known by the defendants to be false – and had therefore been submitted fraudulently. According to the plaintiffs, the evidence of fraud and/or corruption was eventually revealed through the findings in two orders: (a) the 19 January 2017 Non-Prosecution Agreement between the US Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and Las Vegas Sands (“LVS”) (“the DOJ Agreement”); and (b) the 7 April 2016 Order by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instituting cease–and–desist proceedings against LVS (“the SEC Order”). The DOJ Agreement and the SEC Order are collectively referred to hereafter as the “FCPA Findings”. The plaintiffs characterise their fraud allegations as procedural fraud (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, fraud by a party, suppression of documentary evidence or perjury) constituting a ground for setting aside and a bar to the enforcement of the Partial Award. They also characterise the FCPA Findings as “new evidence” of the defendants’ fraud even though the new evidence came into existence after the Partial Award was rendered. The new evidence was discovered, subsequently, post-award and the plaintiffs argue that the new evidence serve to establish that the Partial Award was based on wrong or incomplete facts owing to deliberate suppression or concealment of evidence and the new evidence would have influenced the way the plaintiffs’ case was presented to the Tribunal (“the new evidence argument”).  On either characterisation, this court should set aside the Partial Award and refuse enforcement since the procedural fraud and new evidence argument would have affected the Tribunal, the arbitral proceedings and/or the Partial Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Basically, the plaintiffs’ substantive applications in OS 1432 are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  To set aside the Partial Award under s 24 of the International  Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) and Art 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”) as set out in the First Schedule of the IAA; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, to resist the enforcement of the Partial Award in Singapore. The challenge to enforcement of the Partial Award is on the main ground that the Partial Award is contrary to Singapore public policy under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. The secondary ground that is relied upon is Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiffs were unable to present its case by reason of the fraud committed by the defendants in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings in multiple respects such as the suppression of critical evidence and deception of the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The first substantive issue concerns the validity of the Partial Award in that the Partial Award was induced or affected by fraud or the way in which it was procured is contrary to public policy in that the defendants had concealed documentary evidence or committed perjury with the dishonest intention to deliberately mislead the Tribunal and/or the plaintiffs. The alternative substantive issue for this court in the present proceedings to determine is whether, if the plaintiffs’ fraud allegations are established on the new evidence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the FCPA Findings), it would be contrary to Singapore public policy to permit enforcement of the Partial Award in this jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 OS 1432 was commenced out of time after the expiry of the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law. In addition, the permissible time limit to set aside HC/ORC 6609/2016 dated 27 September 2016, which is the order made in Originating Summons No 979 of 2016 (“OS 979”) granting leave of court to enforce the Partial Award in Singapore, had also expired. Consequently, on 20 June 2017, HC/JUD 355/2017 was filed against the plaintiffs in terms of the Partial Award (hereafter referred to as “the Enforcement Judgment”). HC/ORC 6609/2016 and the Enforcement Judgment are collectively referred to hereafter as “the enforcement orders”. The plaintiffs now seek an extension of time: (a) to set aside the Partial Award; and (b) to set aside the enforcement orders. In both instances of delay, the plaintiffs rely on the common ground that the fraud that induced or affected the making of the Partial Award was only discovered after the relevant timelines had expired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I propose to deal with the extension of time applications before considering the applicable legal principles, the details of the evidence before the court on the substantive applications and my decision on the issues. It is fair to state that the time extensions to set aside the Partial Award and challenge to the enforcement orders, if granted, will shape the grounds of challenge in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Mr Alvin Yeo, SC (“Mr Yeo”) represents the plaintiffs and Mr Cavinder Bull, SC (“Mr Bull”), represents the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 A brief outline of the parties and the procedural history is helpful before turning to consider the extension of time applications. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The first plaintiff, Bloomberry, and second plaintiff, Sureste, are the owners of the Solaire Resort &amp; Casino (“Solaire”), a luxury hotel and gaming resort located in Manila, Philippines. The second plaintiff is wholly owned by Bloomberry Resorts Corporation, a listed company in the Philippines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The first defendant, GGAM is the sole owner of the second defendant, GGAM Netherlands. During the period in issue, the defendants had four senior executives: Mr William P. Weidner (“Mr Weidner”) as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Mr Bradley Stone (“Mr Stone”) as the President, Mr Garry W. Saunders (“Mr Saunders”) as the Executive Vice President and Mr Eric Chiu (“Mr Chiu”), President for Asia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In turn, GGAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Gaming Asset Management LP, a firm that develops, invests, manages and advises hospitality companies and projects, with an emphasis on the casino sector. Global Gaming Asset Management LP is a joint venture between an entity owned and controlled by Mr Weidner, Mr Stone and Mr Saunders, and a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald LP (“Cantor Fitzgerald”), a global financial services firm.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The plaintiffs and GGAM entered into the MSA on 9 September 2011 “to provide management and technical services in the development and construction, and to manage the operation of” Solaire for a period of 10 years.

</div> GGAM subsequently transferred all its rights, titles, benefits, privileges, obligations and interest under the MSA to GGAM Netherlands, the second defendant, under an Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated 8 March 2013. For ease of reference, GGAM, where used in the judgment below, is taken to refer to GGAM Netherlands as well as no distinction needs to be made between the two for the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Subsequently, for reasons that will be explained below, the plaintiffs sought to terminate the MSA. The defendants duly commenced arbitration against the plaintiffs pursuant to cl 19.2 of the MSA.  On 20 September 2016, following the hearings on liability in October 2015, the Tribunal decided in the Partial Award that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia,</span> there was no causal fraud or misrepresentation by the defendants in relation to the MSA and that the plaintiffs’ termination of the MSA was not justified and constituted a breach of the MSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The SEC Order was published on 7 April 2016 and the DOJ Agreement was published on 17 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As highlighted earlier, HC/ORC 6609/2016 was made in OS 979 on 27 September 2016. HC/ORC 6609/2016 was served on the second plaintiff and the first plaintiff on 4 January 2017 and 10 March 2017 respectively. The defendants filed the Enforcement Judgment in terms of the Partial Award on 20 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 21 December 2017, the defendants filed OS 1432 seeking to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, set aside the Partial Award or, in the alternative, to challenge the enforcement of the Partial Award. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time extension applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As mentioned earlier, OS 1432 was filed out of time after the expiry of two different and separate timelines. The first concerns the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law, and the second relates to the fourteen-day timeline stipulated in HC/ORC 6609/2016. In both instances, the plaintiffs seek the necessary time extensions before proceeding with the merits of the substantive matters in OS 1432. I propose to consider the application to extend the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law before turning to the plaintiffs’ non-compliance with the timeline stipulated in HC/ORC 6609/2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Time extension for setting aside the Partial Award </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 OS 1432 was filed on 21 December 2017, approximately one year after the three-month time limit to set aside the Partial Award expired on 20 December 2016. The plaintiffs’ application to set aside the Partial Award is made under s 24 of the IAA and/or Art 34(2) of the Model Law. Other than the three-month time limit in Art 34(3), there is no express provision in s 24 of the IAA stipulating the time within which applications to set aside arbitral awards on s 24 grounds must be made. Before dealing with the court’s powers, if any, to extend time, there are two anterior questions that must first be answered: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether applications to set aside awards brought under s 24 of IAA are subject to the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law (“Question (a)”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the time limit stipulated in Art 34(3) of the Model Law is an absolute time limit that favours the finality of arbitral awards or, is it extendable in exceptional circumstances like fraud, bribery or corruption (“Question (b)”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I propose to answer Question (b) first because the case law on Art 34(3) is now fairly settled. Article 34(3) of the Model Law states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the award or, if a request had been made under Article 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The words “may not” in Art 34(3) have been held to be mandatory in meaning by setting an absolute time limit of three months beginning from the date of receipt of the award, after which all recourse against the award is barred. Such an absolute time limit recognises the need for finality and legal certainty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Specifically, the rulings of the Singapore High Court on Art 34(3) of the Model Law in <span class="font-italic">ABC Co v XYZ Co Ltd</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 546 (“<span class="font-italic">ABC v XYZ</span>”) at [9], <span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu Indah and others v Newmont Indonesia Ltd and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu</span>”) at [30]<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara</span> <span class="font-italic">International BV </span><span class="font-italic">and others v PT Ayunda Prima Mitra and others</span> [2013] 1 SLR 636 (“<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara (HC)</span>”) at [97], is that the time limit prescribed in Art 34(3) Model Law is strict. It is clear that Art 34 is meant not only to limit the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award, but it also prescribes that any challenge made on Art 34 grounds must be brought promptly within the period specified: see <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [97]. This legal position is followed in two recent decisions of the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) in <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> [2019] SGHC(I) 10 (“<span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span>”) at [39]–[41] and <span class="font-italic">BXY </span><span class="font-italic">and others v BXX and others</span> [2019] SGHC(I) 11 (“<span class="font-italic">BXY v BXX</span>”) at [83] that were published after the hearings for OS 1432 were completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Yeo submits that this court should depart from the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">ABC v XYZ</span> and <span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu</span> and he urges this court to instead adopt the approach of the Hong Kong court in <span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang v Hong Kong &amp; China Gas (Jilin)</span> [2016] HKCFI 1611 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang</span>”). The plaintiffs’ position remains the same (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time limit in Art 34(3) is extendable) after parties were invited on 18 July 2019 to address the court on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the decision of <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> where Anselmo Reyes IJ in that case analysed the reasoning of the judge in <span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang</span>. Both sides responded on <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> in writing on 24 July 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 <span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang</span> held that the Model Law does not preclude the court from regulating the procedure of applications to set aside awards, and therefore the court has the discretion to grant an extension of time under Art 34(3) (at [90]). Like Reyes IJ, I am unpersuaded by the court’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang</span> which starts with and draws support from the court’s permissive interpretation of the word “may” in Art 34(2) of the Model Law to give a similar permissive interpretation to the words “may not” in Art 34(3). Such an interpretation cannot be correct. A different meaning is convey by the single word “may” in Art 34(2) as compared to the words “may not” in the context of Art 34(3). As rightly analysed by Reyes IJ in <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT </span>at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the discretion conferred by the word “may” in Article 34(2) merely refers to the court’s discretion not to set aside an award even where one or more of the conditions in Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) to (iv) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) to (ii) have been established. The word “may” in Article 34(2) accordingly cannot have any logical bearing on one’s understanding of the expression “may not” in Article 34(3). There is the additional problem that Mimmie Chan J appears to be using subsidiary legislation (Order 73 of the Rules of the Hong Kong Court (“RHC”)) to construe the extent to which a deadline imposed by primary legislation (Article 34(3) of the Model Law as enacted by s 81 of the HKAO) can be extended. No explanation is given as to why such a mode of interpretation is permissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the context of Art 34(3), the words “may not” take on a mandatory meaning of “cannot”. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held in <span class="font-italic">ABC v XYZ</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [9]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All [Art 34(3)] says is that [an] application [to set aside] may not be made after the lapse of three months from a specified date. Although the words used are ‘may not’ these must be interpreted as ‘cannot’ as it is clear that the intention is to limit the time during which an award may be challenged. This interpretation is supported by material relating to the discussions amongst the drafters of the Model Law.  It appears to me that the court would not be able to entertain any application lodged after the expiry of the three-month period as art 34 has been drafted as the all-encompassing, and only, basis for challenging an award in court.  It does not provide for any extension of the time period and, as the court derives its jurisdiction to hear the application from the article alone, the absence of such a provision means the court has not been conferred with the power to extend time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Hence, starting with the decision of <span class="font-italic">ABC v XYZ</span> and, more recently, the decisions of the SICC, the legal position in Singapore is that the time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law is strict, favouring the policy of finality of arbitral awards (see <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT </span>at [40]) and legal certainty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Mr Yeo in his written response of 24 July 2019, firstly, disagrees with Reyes IJ that Art 34(3) operates as a limitation provision, and secondly, he distinguishes <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> from the present case. On the first point, I am not persuaded by Mr Yeo that the court in <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> incorrectly held that Art 34(3) is a written law relating to limitation within the meaning of paragraph 7 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). I agree with Reyes IJ’s comment on the inappropriateness of relying on the court’s power derived from procedural rules of court to extend time prescribed in a primary legislation (at [31] of <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> quoted in [24]) above). As rightly noted by Roger Giles IJ in <span class="font-italic">BXY v BXX</span> at [88], “a power to extend time under a Rule cannot overcome a time limitation in primary legislation” and the time limitation under Art 34(3) of the Model Law still supersedes the court’s general discretion under the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In distinguishing <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Mr Yeo argues that <span class="font-italic">BXS v BXT</span> did not involve an award whose making was “induced or affected” by fraud. His argument leads me to the second part of Question (b), namely, whether the usual time limit of three months is extendable where fraud as a ground is raised to set aside an arbitral award. Mr Yeo contends that the time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law should be extendable in cases of fraud and, more so, where the fraud is discovered only after the expiry of the time limit. Mr Bull takes a contrary position arguing that the time limit in Art 34(3) is, without exception, strict. He referred to materials from the 18th session of UNCITRAL’s working group for the preparation of the Model Law. At that session, there was a proposal to establish a separate regime that provided for a considerably longer period of time than in Art 34(3) for the setting aside of an award on the grounds of fraud, or where evidence was false or only discovered later. The Report of the UNCITRAL on the work of its Eighteenth Session (A/40/17, 3–21 June 1985) at paras 299–300 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">299. Thus, considering whether any ground should be added, divergent views were expressed as to the need for such addition. Under one view, there was a need for adding wording to subparagraph (a)(ii) which would cover instances of serious departure from fundamental principles of procedure. Under another view, there was a need for establishing a separate regime, providing for a considerably longer period of time than the one set forth in article 34(3), for such cases as fraud or false evidence which had materially affected the award.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">300. Under yet another view, there was no need for any addition in view of the understanding agreed to by the Commission as regards the ground set forth in subparagraph (b)(ii). In reply to the suggestion for <span class="font-underline">allowing a considerably longer period of time in which to apply for setting aside an award on the grounds of fraud, or that evidence was false or discovered only later, it was stated that such extension was contrary to the need for the speedy and final settlement of disputes in international commercial relationships.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This proposal of a separate regime with a different time period to apply to setting aside applications brought on grounds of fraud or corruption was considered but eventually rejected because Art 34(3) was drafted as it is. It is plain that the drafters chose to favour the finality of arbitral awards. The time limit in Art 34(3) is absolute in that all recourse against arbitral awards outside the three-month period (starting from the time of receipt of the award) are barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Mr Yeo accepts that national legislation may modify the time limit in Art 34(3). Unlike Malaysia, New Zealand and Ireland (all are Model Law States), Singapore has not expressly allowed for an exception to or extension of the three-month time limit in Art 34(3). There is no provision in the IAA that computes the time limit in Art 34(3) from the date of discovery of the fraud or withheld evidence or discovery of new facts or evidence post-award. The legislative approach taken in New Zealand is to modify the time limit in Art 34(3) to exclude the application of the three-month time limit in specific cases of fraud or corruption. Article 34(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996 (NZ) sch 1 ch 7 reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An application for setting aside may not be made after 3 months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the award or, if a request had been made under article 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal.  <span class="font-weight-bold">This paragraph does not apply to an application for setting aside on the ground that the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In Malaysia, s 37(5) of the Malaysian Arbitration Act 2005 (Act 646) expressly states that the three-month limit will not apply to setting aside applications based on grounds that the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption. The relevant sub-sections of s 37 read as follow:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) An application for setting aside may not be made after the expiry of ninety days from the date on which the party making the application had received the award or if a request has been made under section 35, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Subsection (4) <span class="font-weight-bold">does not apply to an application for setting aside on the ground that the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In Ireland, s 12 of the Arbitration Act 2010 modifies Art 34(3) of the Model Law as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notwithstanding Article 34(3)</span>, an application to the High Court to set aside an award on the grounds that the award is in conflict with the public policy of the State shall be made within a period of 56 days <span class="font-weight-bold">from the date on which the circumstances giving rise to the application became known or ought reasonably to have become known to the party concerned.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This modification means that the timeline of 56 days for setting aside of the award only starts from the time when fraud as a public policy ground is discovered or ought reasonably to have been discovered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is now an appropriate juncture to consider Question (a), which is whether s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IAA is a separate regime with no express time limit for setting aside of arbitral awards on grounds of fraud or corruption. Question (a) also poses the additional query, which is whether, as a matter of construction of s 24, the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) is applicable to applications to set aside arbitral awards based on s 24 grounds. It is not surprising that Mr Yeo and Mr Bull construe the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1) of Model Law” in the opening sentence of s 24 of the IAA differently. If Mr Bull’s construction of the phrase is preferred over Mr Yeo’s, then applications brought under subsections (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of s 24 of the IAA are subject to the time bar in Art 34(3) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Section 24 of the IAA states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may set aside award</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24. <span class="font-italic">Notwithstanding</span> <span class="font-italic">Article 34(1) of the Model Law</span>, the High Court may, <span class="font-italic">in addition</span> to the grounds set out in Article 34(2) of the Model Law, set aside the award of the arbitral tribunal if –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Article 34(1) of the Model Law states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 34.

The debate centres on whether s 24 of the IAA creates a regime to set aside an award that is separate from the grounds listed in Art 34 of the Model Law. While Mr Yeo acknowledges the overlap in the grounds of “breach of natural justice” in s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and “otherwise unable to present its case” in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law, he submits that this overlap does not undermine his position that s 24 of the IAA is a separate regime with no express statutory time limit, and that the only applicable time limit is prescribed by O 69A r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). Furthermore, the procedural timelines set by the ROC are extendable at the discretion of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Mr Bull takes the opposite view: there is only one regime and Art 34(3) of the Model Law applies to the two grounds in s 24 of the IAA. He reasons that in the absence of any legislative exclusion or extension, the time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law is applicable to applications to set aside arbitral awards on the ground that the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The real issue in the debate is whether, as a matter of construction, the opening words “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1) of the Model Law” in s 24 of the IAA excludes in effect the time limit set out in Art 34(3) of the Model Law from applications to set aside arbitral awards under s 24. Another perspective is to ask the question whether the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) is incorporated into s 24 by the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1)” in s 24.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On Mr Yeo’s interpretation of “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1) of the Model Law”, applications for setting aside based on s 24 for both fraud and breach of natural justice derogate from both Art 34(2) and Art 34(3). This is because s 24 provides an entirely separate regime for applications to set aside brought under exceptional circumstances such as fraud, corruption, and prejudicial breaches of natural justice, for which Parliament chose not to include an express time limit within which such an application must be brought. According to Mr Yeo, Parliament intended to introduce a distinct remedy in s 24 unconstrained by the limitations in both Art 34(2) and Art 34(3) of the Model Law. This separate, flexible remedy would be available for more egregious cases such as where there had been fraud or corruption in the making of an arbitral award or breaches of natural justice that prejudiced the rights of a party and impugned the arbitral process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Mr Bull interprets the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Art 34(1) of Model Law” as referring to s 24 of the IAA being in spite of the grounds for setting aside enumerated in Art 34(2) of the Model Law, and not with reference to the time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law. Section 24 provides for additional grounds to set aside arbitral awards, in spite of the grounds listed under Art 34(2) of the Model Law. In particular, Mr Bull explains that the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Art 34(1) of Model Law” must be read with the key words expressed in s 24 of the IAA, “in addition to the grounds set out in Art 34(2)”, which is consistent with Mr Bull’s construction: courts may apply s 24 of the IAA in spite of the grounds set out in Art 34(2) of the Model Law, and not in spite of the time limitation set out in Art 34(3) of the Model Law. Hence, an application to set aside an arbitral award on a ground set out in s 24 of the IAA is still subject to the three-month time limitation under Art 34(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I digress to mention my earlier <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> views expressed in <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>on the time limit in s 24. In that case, I foreshadowed the possibility of reviewing the o<span class="font-italic">biter </span>views on a future occasion at [120]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If FM’s case had been one of fraud which had only been discovered after the expiry of the applicable time bars, I have no doubt that this would be a case of “prevent[ing] injustice” which would warrant a court’s exercise of its powers under O 92 r 4 of the ROC to remedy the procedural breach under O 69A r 2(4) of the ROC. It cannot be the case that mere procedural irregularity under the ROC forces a court to accept that an arbitration agreement is not impeached by fraud, or to accept the consequences of that fraud. Another instance where O 69A r 2(4) is not likely to apply is where a court in the country which is the seat of the arbitration, raises on its own motion a public policy objection at the enforcement stage. In this situation, the court’s power is unfettered by time limits. Until a case comes squarely before the Singapore court for determination, I do not have to decide the procedural points and will say no more about the matter. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Needless to say, I am open to reviewing the <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> views taken in <span class="font-italic">Astro</span><span class="font-italic"> Nusantara (HC) </span>on this matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 That said, with the benefit of counsel’s arguments and materials now placed before me, I find that Mr Bull’s interpretation is preferred for the following cumulative reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, the legal position in Singapore with reference to the time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law militates in favour of Mr Bull’s interpretation. As explained above, the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) is strict, favouring the policy of finality of arbitral awards and legal certainty. The drafters of the Model Law decided that cases of fraud, bribery or corruption should be subject to the strict time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Second, I disagree with Mr Yeo’s contention that the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1) of the Model Law” in s 24 of the IAA effectively modified both Art 34(2) and Art 34(3) of the Model Law. As stated earlier, Mr Yeo explains the modification as follows: in the case of Art 34(2), additional grounds to set aside arbitral awards are introduced in s 24; and Art 34(3) is modified in the sense that the three-month time limit does not apply to s 24 grounds. I again refer to the statutory position adopted in Malaysia, New Zealand and Ireland that expressly provide for the exclusion of the three-month time limit in cases of fraud or corruption (see [29]–[31]). This is consistent with the book chapter, Nathalie Voser and Anya George, “Revision of Arbitral Awards” in Pierre Tercier, <span class="font-italic">Post Award Issues </span>(ASA Special Series No. 38, 2012) ch 3, cited in Mr Bull’s bundle of authorities. As the Chapter shows, it is left to national laws to decide whether to adopt the time limit set out in Art 34(3) or to provide separate time limits for setting aside of fraudulently obtained arbitral awards and/or for the situation where there is subsequent discovery of new facts or evidence post award (at p 47). The authors’ comparative law review in continental Europe reveals that if there is to be modification of the time limit in Art 34(3), the approach adopted is to legislate for separate time limits in respect of arbitral awards subsequently found to have been based on erroneous facts or to have been influenced by procedural fraud. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, Mr Yeo’s construction of the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Art 34(1) of the Model Law” rests on the assumption that both s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> fraud) and s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> breach of natural justice) are exempt from the time limit in Art 34(3) despite significant overlaps in the scope of the grounds listed in s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. It is not disputed that cases of fraud, bribery or corruption fall within the ambit of public policy as a ground for setting aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) and there is no exception to the three-month time limit for this ground. The upshot of Mr Yeo’s construction is an internal inconsistency within the legislation: (a) there is a <span class="font-weight-bold">non-extendable</span> three-month time limitation if recourse against an arbitral award is brought under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii); and (b) the applicable time limit for an application to set aside an arbitral award under s 24 of the IAA is governed by O 69A r 2(4) of the ROC and this procedural time limit is <span class="font-weight-bold">extendable</span> subject to the court’s general discretion under O 3 r 4(1) and O 92 r 4 of the ROC to prevent injustice. The inconsistency as described will result if the opening words “[n]otwithstanding Article 34(1) of the Model Law” in s 24 of the IAA are construed to have the effect of carving out the time limit in Article 34(3) for s 24 grounds. Parliament could not have intended for such an incongruous and absurd result whereby parties restricted by the non-extendable three-month time limitation under Art 34(2) of the Model Law would be able to circumvent the time bar requirement by resorting to the grounds set out in s 24 of the IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, Mr Yeo’s contention that Parliament must have intended for special and narrow cases of fraud or corruption under s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of IAA (which could at times be discoverable only three months after the receipt of the award) not to be subject to the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law is untenable. Whilst he has a point that such a construction would prevent fraudsters and corrupt parties from profiting from their own misdeeds on a procedural technicality, his contention runs into difficulty for two reasons when applied to s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA for the breach of rules of natural justice. First, most breaches of natural justice ought to be apparent and discoverable at the arbitral hearing, and are thereafter discernible from the award so that any recourse against the award would be within three months of receipt of the arbitral award. Second, the lack of harmonisation within the two limbs of s 24 creates an unsatisfactory situation: s 24 of the IAA becomes a limping provision, where both grounds under s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA are exempt from the non-extendable time limitation even though the aforementioned policy reason only justifies such an exemption in the case of s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). I can find no reason for this, especially where the s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA<span class="font-italic"> </span>ground for breach of rules of natural justice has such a broad scope and substantially overlaps with the “otherwise unable to present its case” ground in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the above reasons, Mr Bull’s construction of the phrase “[n]otwithstanding Art 34(1) of the Model Law” is preferred over Mr Yeo’s. To answer both Questions (a) and (b), applications brought under s 24 of the IAA are subject to the three-month time limit in Art 34(3) of the Model Law, which is an absolute one that favours finality of arbitral awards. The plaintiffs’ application to set aside the Partial Award under s 24 of the IAA and Art 34(2) of the Model Law was filed out of time and it is therefore dismissed with costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Time Extension for setting aside the enforcement order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In OS 1432, the plaintiffs seek an extension of time for the plaintiffs to apply to set aside HC/ORC 6609/2016 granting leave to the defendants to enforce the Partial Award in the same manner as a Judgment or Order of this court. The application for time extension is made pursuant to O 3 r 4(1) of the ROC and/or under the inherent jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiffs did not apply to set aside HC/ORC 6609/2016 within fourteen days of service of the same as stipulated therein. The defendants filed the Enforcement Judgment in terms of the Partial Award on 20 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Order 3 r 4(1) of the ROC provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act in any proceedings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The words “such terms as it thinks just” gives the court discretion to grant time extension in order to achieve justice in the circumstances of the case. Generally, the factors the court takes into consideration in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are: (a) the length of delay; (b) the reasons for delay; (c) the chances of the defaulting party succeeding on appeal if the time for appealing were extended; and (d) the degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if the extension of time were granted: see <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo</span> [2011] 2 SLR 196 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">AD v AE</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 505 at [10]) with the courts generally focusing on the first two: <span class="font-italic">Falmac Ltd v Cheng Ji Lai Charlie</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter </span>[2014] 4 SLR 202 at [14]. The first two factors are relevant to the present application for time extension. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International B.V.</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v PT First Media TBK</span> [2018] HKCFA 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International B.V.</span>”)<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong allowed an extension of time notwithstanding the fact that the order granting leave to enforce was set aside 14 months out of time. While the court noted that the delay of 14 months was substantial, it took into consideration the fact that the opposing party had not suffered any substantial prejudice (other than costs) and to refuse extension would be to “deny First Media a hearing where its application has decisively strong merits” (at [87]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In this case, there was a delay of approximately 11 months and 9 months after the relevant deadline had expired for the second plaintiff and the first plaintiff respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Whilst the length of delay is a factor, the main focus here is on the reason for the extension. The application for an extension is based on new evidence that was discovered post-award. The plaintiffs explained that the FCPA Findings were made after the liability hearing, and they discovered from the FCPA Findings new evidence of the alleged fraudulent and corrupt conduct of Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu and their significance could only be fully appreciated after the relevant timeline had expired. Thereafter, the plaintiffs went to the Tribunal with a Request for Reconsideration of the Partial Award. After that avenue failed, the plaintiffs filed OS 1432 on 21 December 2017.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Specifically, the fourteen-day timeline in HC/ORC 6609/2016 to set aside the same expired on 18 January 2017 and 24 March 2017 for the second plaintiff and the first plaintiff respectively, while the DOJ Agreement was only published on 17 January 2017. While I note that the SEC Order was issued on 7 April 2016, I agree with the plaintiffs that the DOJ Agreement is a more important document since it contained critical findings. As shall be seen in the later part of this judgment, the DOJ Agreement also carries greater evidential weight, especially since LVS admitted to facts in the DOJ Agreement, while LVS neither admitted nor denied the facts in the SEC Order. The DOJ Agreement quotes specific e-mails involving Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu regarding the termination of an LVS finance employee. For the time extension application, I am prepared to accept at face value the plaintiffs’ contention that the FCPA Findings had to be read together to be properly appreciated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The plaintiffs’ reasons for the delay and allegations of fraud are closely connected in that the allegations of fraud are bound up with the merits of the application to challenge enforcement of the Partial Award. As I see it, it is within the court’s discretion to extend time and defer matters that are bound up with the merits to the substantive hearing proper. Put another way, given the circumstances of the present case, the plaintiffs ought to be allowed to assert the allegations of fraud as put forward in the application for time extension without reference to the further point of whether they are likely to succeed or not at the substantive hearing. This approach is in the overall interest of justice having regard also to the minimal prejudice caused to the defendants. Accordingly, I allow the time extension to the plaintiffs’ application to set aside HC/ORC 6609/2016 and the Enforcement Judgment made in default of the plaintiffs’ non-compliance with the relevant timeline. The plaintiffs are to pay the defendants costs of the time extension application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Overview of the application to resist enforcement of the Partial Award  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The next section of this judgment will cover the application in OS 1432 to resist enforcement of the Partial Award under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> contrary to public policy), and Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> “otherwise unable to present his case”). In this regard, it is necessary to touch on the events leading to the Arbitration, the Tribunal’s findings in the Partial Award as well as explain the FCPA Findings in some detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Before that however, it bears noting that the Partial Award is final and binding on the plaintiffs since it has not been set aside. On the face of the Partial Award, the findings of the Tribunal are that the MSA is not contrary to Philippines Law and thus, in that sense, there is no finding that the MSA and its performance, being lawful, is contrary to the public policy of the Philippines. In this case, the only purpose of the plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud is to use fraud under public policy considerations as a defence to resist the recognition or enforcement of the Partial Award and to set aside the enforcement orders. Whilst public policy exception exists to prevent enforcement in appropriate cases, proving the defence of violation of public policy based on the ground of fraud presents legal and evidentiary challenges that require the court to go behind a valid award. At any rate, the court will not disturb the principles of finality in arbitration without good reason; the court has to be satisfied that some form of reprehensible or unconscionable conduct that is within the spectrum of gravity of public policy considerations had contributed in a material way to procuring the Partial Award or had an important influence on the result. In this case, the public policy question under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of Model Law hinges on the plaintiffs’ allegations of fraud. If fraud is not proved, that is the end of the inquiry and the application to resist enforcement of the Partial Award fails. Likewise, the outcome of the plaintiffs’ reliance on Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no opportunity to present their case), which also hinges of the same allegations of fraud, would be the same if fraud is not proved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On 12 September 2013, the plaintiffs issued a Notice of Termination of the MSA to the defendants affirming “the termination of the [MSA] with GGAM because of material breach of the MSA under Clause 15.1(a) of the MSA”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arguments before the Tribunal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Tribunal was broadly faced with two key issues – one relating to whether the defendants had perpetrated causal fraud on the plaintiffs in inducing them into entering the MSA (the “Causal Fraud Issue”); the other being whether the plaintiffs were justified on any ground in terminating the MSA (the “Termination Issue”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Causal Fraud Issue was concerned with allegations of various misrepresentations purportedly made by the defendants to the plaintiffs ([72] of the Partial Award), which led the plaintiffs into entering the MSA. The misrepresentations related to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the following matters: (a) that GGAM could be equated with LVS; (b) that GGAM had pre-existing relationships with junket operators and guest data; (c) that GGAM was supposed to prepare proprietary documentation for the performance of services under the MSA to be furnished to the plaintiffs; (d) that the directors of GGAM would provide a “hands-on approach” to the management of Solaire; and (e) that the role of Cantor Fitzgerald (one of the owners of the holding company of GGAM) was not fully disclosed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As to the Termination Issue, the question was whether the plaintiffs had wrongfully terminated the MSA based on the defendants’ purported material breaches, particularly the defendants’ failure to deliver junkets or VIPs to Solaire. Notably, Mr Weidner gave evidence that the defendants had two unique strategies for attracting the junkets and foreign VIPs to Solaire: (a) a “government-led, top-down junket approach”; and (b) a “cross-border trading platform to promote business and gaming visitations between China and the Philippines”. This evidence was intended to refute the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants had failed to perform their obligations under the MSA.

</div>
</div> In OS 1432, Mr Yeo submits that Mr Weidner’s two strategies came up for the first time and belatedly at the Arbitration. In other words, the so-called strategies were an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As such, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had rightfully ended the MSA due to GGAM’s material breach of its obligations thereunder. The plaintiffs’ key arguments in the Arbitration can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The misrepresentations and/or conduct of GGAM amounted to causal fraud under Philippines Law that led the plaintiffs to enter into the MSA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Causal Fraud Issue);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs’ termination under cl 15.1 of the MSA (see [211] below) was justified because of the various breaches of the MSA committed by the defendants (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Termination Issue). These breaches include:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The failure to perform its obligations “through the Management Team”;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The  failure to submit business and marketing plans that met prudent industry practice under various clauses of the MSA;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Breach of the obligation to establish policies and procedures critical to the successful operation of an integrated casino as required under Annex A to the MSA;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Failure to use commercially reasonable efforts in the performance of its obligations pursuant to cl 2.5 of the MSA; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Breach of the obligation to provide “hands-on management” as promised by Mr Weidner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tribunal’s findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Tribunal dismissed the Causal Fraud Issue on the ground that to the extent that any representations were made by the defendants, they were not false or fraudulent at the time they were made. Under Philippines Law which governed the MSA, the Tribunal noted that causal fraud is fraud “present or employed at the time of the birth or perfection of the contract” ([124] of the Partial Award). The fraud in question had to be sufficiently serious and there must be “full, clear, and convincing evidence, and not merely by a preponderance thereof” ([126] of the Partial Award).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Amongst other things, the Tribunal found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no evidence that the defendants represented themselves as being the same entity as LVS. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The alleged representations about the defendants’ access to junket operators was made after the MSA had been signed, and thus could not constitute inducement ([131] of the Partial Award). In any case, given the standing of Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in the gaming industry, it was likely that the defendants did have access to the junket operators or “high rollers” that were to be brought to Solaire;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was simply no evidence of the defendants’ alleged representation that they would prepare proprietary documentation for the plaintiffs ([133] of the Partial Award). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As for the representations about the “hands-on approach” to be provided by the defendants’ directors, the Tribunal found that these were statements of intention that were true at the time they were made and there was insufficient evidence to show the contrary ([138] of the Partial Award). In any case, the plaintiffs themselves had altered the management structure subsequently, which meant that there could not have been any reasonable reliance on those previous statements. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Finally, the Tribunal found that the plaintiffs did not establish that any false statement was made as regards Cantor Fitzgerald’s role. In any event, the plaintiffs have also not demonstrated any legal basis mandating disclosure of information relating to the partnership between GGAM and Cantor Fitzgerald ([147] of the Partial Award).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 With respect to the Termination Issue, the Tribunal dismissed all of the plaintiffs’ purported grounds for termination and found that the plaintiffs had wrongfully terminated the MSA. Specifically, the Tribunal found, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) GGAM did perform its obligations through the Management Team in accordance with the MSA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) GGAM fulfilled its obligation to prepare, through the Management Team, the Business and Marketing Plans under cl 2.10 of the MSA, and through the Management Team, started to implement them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Again, GGAM fulfilled its obligation to produce policies and procedures under Annex A of the MSA, which were done through the Management Team headed by Mr French.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The evidence was insufficient to substantiate a material breach of the obligation to make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the standard of care enshrined in cl 2.5 of the MSA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The defendants had provided the necessary hands-on management and in any case, the purported representations in this regard could not have been justifiably relied upon because the management structure of Solaire had been revised.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The above grounds for termination relied on by the plaintiffs do not qualify as material or “substantial and fundamental” violations of the MSA that would justify rescission or annulment of the MSA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Events that are post-Arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The fraud now alleged by the plaintiffs to resist the enforcement of the Partial Award is premised on the FCPA Findings. On 31 August 2017, the plaintiffs filed a Request for Reconsideration of the Partial Award to the Tribunal in the light of the FCPA Findings. In the request, the plaintiffs sought, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>for the Tribunal to reconsider its Partial Award and make an award finding that the plaintiffs had “rightfully ended the [MSA] due to GGAM’s material breach of its obligations thereunder”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The first transaction concerns a basketball team. In early 2007, Mr Weidner sought to purchase a professional basketball team in China with the purported purpose of improving LVS’ image in China and increasing customer flow to the casinos (“the Basketball Team transaction”). Due to regulations by the Chinese Basketball Association, neither LVS nor its subsidiaries could purchase a team. Hence, the Consultant was used as a “beard” to buy the team through a wholly foreign-owned entity, while LVS entered into “what was ostensibly a sponsorship agreement for the team.” Funds were repeatedly transferred to the Consultant without any supporting documentation. Payments to the Consultant were also falsely recorded in the company’s books and records. In total, between March 2007 and January 2009, pursuant to a series of sponsorship and advertising contracts, approximately US$14.8m was paid to the Consultant in connection with the basketball team. Over one-third of the funds were paid after the accounting firm engaged by LVS to review the transaction had identified significant funds that were unaccounted for, and approximately US$6.9m was transferred without appropriate authorisation or supporting documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The second transaction relates to an Adelson Centre in China. Beginning in 2006, Mr Weidner sought to develop a non-gaming resort in Hengqin Island, China (“the Adelson Centre transaction”). Such a development would require the approval of government authorities and the Consultant introduced to LVS a Chinese state-owned travel agency, China International Travel Services Ltd (“CITS”), whose Chairman was believed to have “particular influence in connection with Hengqin”. Mr Weidner authorised using the Consultant as a “beard” to purchase a building in Beijing from CITS and it was named the Adelson Center. Mr Weidner gave little or no thought to agreeing to purchase the Beijing building. Between July 2007 and February 2008, approximately US$43m was transferred to one of the Consultant’s entities for the purchase of the real estate, but none of the payments were approved by an LVS employee with sufficient authorisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In August 2007, while significant concerns were raised that the Consultant intended to obtain the basement title to the building by making improper payments to government officials, the company proceeded to lease the basement from the Consultant. However, no documentation was obtained to prove that the Consultant had obtained the title legally or that his entity purchased the basement from CITS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Among other things, in September 2008, Mr Chiu signed contracts that cancelled the transfer of shares from the Consultant’s entity and agreed to receive in exchange from the Consultant a promissory note for approximately US$43m, which far exceeded Mr Chiu’s authority. The project for the Adelson Centre was shuttered at about the same time. In total, LVS transferred approximately US$61m in connection with the real estate transaction and ultimately received approximately US$44m in settlement from the Consultant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Third is a transaction concerning the Macau Operations. In 2007, LVS set up a high-speed ferry business to transport customers from China and Hong Kong to Macau (“the Macau Operations transaction”). Under pressure from Mr Weidner, the LVS employees selected a recently-formed ferry company, Chu Kong Shipping (“CKS”), which was indirectly owned by, amongst others, the Consultant and the Chairman of CITS. Mr Weidner stated in an e-mail that the selection of CKS would be politically advantageous to LVS. CKS was also “spending the majority of the entertainment expense on government officials”, providing them meals and giving them “red envelopes containing cash around the Chinese New Year”, which was known to LVS. LVS also did not enforce policies and procedures regarding purchasing and employees were able to use cash advances and expense reimbursements to circumvent them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The relevant provisions of the Securities Exchange Act 15 USC (US) 1934 (“Securities Exchange Act”) that were engaged are outlined in the SEC Order under the sub-heading of “Legal Standards and FCPA Violations”:

</div> This is the procedural fraud argument. In their view, the defendants have perjured themselves by putting forward a positive case of performance without disclosing the true facts involved in bribing Chinese state officials as a key part of their strategy to deliver those junket operators. This perjury or concealment of evidence, the plaintiffs add, was perpetrated in part by the defendants’ counsel in the Arbitration, Paul Hastings LLP (“Paul Hastings”), which was the same law firm that was representing Mr Weidner with respect to the US government’s investigations into LVS. In this vein, the plaintiffs took issue with the adequacy of the document collection process undertaken by Paul Hastings in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Alongside the argument on procedural fraud, Mr Yeo argues that “new evidence” in the FCPA Findings show that the Partial Award was “tainted by the fraudulent and/or corrupt nature of Mr Weidner’s strategies [in LVS] because… these strategies were deployed in performance of the MSA”.

</div> The basis of the plaintiffs’ allegation is the purported striking similarity in the entities implicated in the LVS investigations and those in the MSA. The plaintiffs and the Tribunal were prevented from discovering the fraudulent and/or corrupt nature of Mr Weidner’s strategies deployed in performance of the MSA due to the defendants<span class="font-weight-bold">’ </span>procedural fraud as outlined above. Thus, quite apart from the concealment and perjury that allegedly transpired in the course of the Arbitration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, procedural fraud), the plaintiffs argue that the new evidence shows that the defendants had committed actual fraud. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The purported consequence of both the procedural fraud and the new evidence argument (which in my view are inextricably intertwined) on the plaintiffs’ case is broadly twofold: (a) the Tribunal’s decision would have been different on a variety of issues (particularly the Causal Fraud Issue and the Termination Issue) if it had known about the purported fraud disclosed in the FCPA Findings; and (b) the Arbitration would have proceeded on an entirely different basis <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, focusing on different matters altogether. Pausing here, the plaintiffs’ allegation that they did not have an opportunity to present their case was also due to the procedural fraud perpetrated by the defendants.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT A</span><span class="font-italic">suransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT As</span><span class="font-italic">uransi</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>held that the public policy ground is invoked when the upholding of the award would “shock the conscience” or is “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public” or “where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice” (at [59]). While <span class="font-italic">PT As</span><span class="font-italic">uransi</span> concerns a setting aside application under Art 34 of the Model Law, the definition and principles therein also apply to the present case of resisting enforcement under Art 36 of the Model Law.

In <span class="font-italic">Beijing Sinozonto</span>, the court found Goldenray’s allegations – specifically that there was an improper arrangement between the respondent and the tribunal based on various e-mails – improbable and unsupported by cogent evidence.

As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT </span>at [62] with reference to <span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span>, where the law applicable to the impugned contract is Singapore law, “the court cannot abrogate its judicial power to the Tribunal to decide what the public policy of Singapore is and, in turn whether or not [the agreement] is illegal”. The court is entitled to decide whether an underlying contract is illegal and refuse to enforce an award that is tainted by the illegality as such. This broad legal proposition is to be understood in its context: that public policy is a question of law for the enforcing court to determine based on its domestic law (at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The plaintiffs are seeking denial of enforcement of the Partial Award against them on grounds of violation of public policy based on fraud. Hence, short of establishing fraud as alleged, the public policy ground is not engaged. The strictness of this approach is consistent with the view that a court should not be quick to interfere under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law and a line is drawn at where the court should observe the principles of finality in arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 An interesting aspect of this case is the new evidence argument explained earlier. The FCPA Findings represent the new evidence that was not in existence at the time of the Arbitration. In my view, the new evidence of fraud needs to be admitted; if it is incontrovertible, the new evidence of fraud could be “accepted” in the interest of saving time and costs. In this case, the defendants did not challenge the FCPA Findings on admissibility. Instead, the dispute was over what the FCPA Findings said and their effects.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Perjury and concealment of evidence during arbitral proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The law concerning perjury and the concealment of evidence has been canvassed in a number of decisions – notably, <span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore </span>and <span class="font-italic">Dongwoo Mann</span><span class="font-italic">+Hummel Co Ltd v Mann+Hummel Gmbh </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 871 (“<span class="font-italic">Dongwoo</span>”) and more recently considered in <span class="font-italic">BVU</span><span class="font-italic"> v BVX</span>. I will outline the key principles herein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Perjury and the deliberate suppression or withholding of documents in an arbitration can in a proper case amount to obtaining an award by fraud: <span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore</span> at [29] and <span class="font-italic">Dongwoo </span>at [139]. Broadly speaking, this means that there has to be fraud in the arbitration itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Specifically, where the fraud alleged is <span class="font-weight-bold">perjury by a party</span> in the arbitration, the applicant must prove that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) False evidence is given in a legal proceeding (and similarly in arbitration) which is intended to cause any person in that proceeding to form an erroneous opinion that touches any point material to the result of such proceeding (<span class="font-italic">Koh Pee Huat v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 816 at [44]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The new evidence demonstrating fraud could not have been discovered or produced, despite reasonable diligence, during the arbitration proceedings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The newly discovered evidence must be decisive in that it would have prompted the arbitrator to have ruled in favour of the applicant instead of the other party (<span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore </span>at [29] approving <span class="font-italic">DDT </span><span class="font-italic">Trucks of North America Ltd v DDT Holdings Ltd </span>[2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 213).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 If the fraud concerns<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">non-disclosure or concealment of material documents</span>, the applicant must prove that (<span class="font-italic">BVU</span><span class="font-italic"> v BVX </span>at [47], <span class="font-italic">Swiss </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>at [25] approving <span class="font-italic">Elektrim SA v </span><span class="font-italic">Vivendi Universal SA </span>[2007] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 693<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Elektrim</span>”)):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is deliberate (as opposed to innocent or negligent) concealment aimed at deceiving the arbitral tribunal or the other party/parties to the arbitration.

Put differently, is there a requisite causative link between the alleged fraud and the Partial Award?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As stated, the FCPA Findings were not in existence at the time of the Arbitration. Admissibility of the FCPA Findings was not an issue before me. Thus, as discussed below at [220], the non-availability of evidence requirement does not really arise taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest. The central debate in the present case is on the scope and effect of the FCPA Findings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is there procedural fraud?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 For the reasons explained below, the plaintiffs’ allegations of concealment of information against either the defendants or Paul Hastings are not made out. In any case, the procedural fraud allegation is short on the materiality requirement <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is not so material that it would have substantially affected the Partial Award. Consequently, it cannot be said, as the plaintiffs have so asserted, that Tribunal’s decision would have been different on the Causal Fraud Issue or the Termination Issue, or that the Arbitration would have proceeded on an entirely different footing altogether.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I will deal first with the plaintiffs’ allegations against the defendants before turning to those against Paul Hastings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged concealment by the defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 With respect to the plaintiffs’ allegations of concealment of information against the defendants, Mr Yeo argues that the defendants had deliberately concealed the matters disclosed in the FCPA Findings. This deliberate concealment substantially impacted the making of the award in the sense that that their fraud resulted in an award in which the Tribunal’s findings would have been materially different absent GGAM’s fraud.

The threshold problem that the plaintiffs encounter by predicating their allegation of procedural fraud on the 18 August 2012 statement is that there is nothing therein that can be remotely said to be given as part of a legal proceeding. Between then and the Arbitration which commenced in September 2013, Solaire was officially opened in March 2013. It was only in July 2013 that the plaintiffs sent a letter to the defendants outlining issues with their execution of the MSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Secondly, notwithstanding that preliminary hurdle, I am inclined to accept the defendants’ submission that the 18 August 2012 Statement was not dishonest or fraudulent.

However, the circumstances surrounding the statement must be appreciated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As just noted, the statement was made in August 2012, more than a year before the notice of arbitration was even filed by the defendants. In addition, while it appears that LVS was already undergoing investigations by the DOJ and SEC in August 2012, it was not until 2016 and 2017 that any findings were reported by these US government authorities. I do not think it can be seriously contested that at that time, investigations were more likely than not in their initial phases and Mr Weidner’s 18 August 2012 statement (and his <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for the purposes of making out a case of procedural fraud) must thus be understood in that context. The test for procedural fraud is not merely inconsistencies or even obvious inconsistencies. It is trite that the linchpin of fraud of any kind is dishonest intention at the material time. I do not see how anything in the 18 August 2012 statement discloses a subjective intent to defraud on the part of Mr Weidner or the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Thirdly, I note that the statement was drafted with the assistance of Mr Weidner’s solicitors and indeed the evidence suggests that the plaintiffs were also advised by their own solicitors at the material time. In OS 1432, Mr Weidner maintains that the statement “truthfully described [his] participation in the transactions under the [LVS] investigation”.

Notably, in one of these declarations filed on 14 June 2015 and in the course of the oral testimony given in the Arbitration itself, Mr Weidner refers to two strategies for managing Solaire as mentioned earlier: (a) developing “a sophisticated and unique government-led, top-down junket approach” and (b) directing “VIP play, by helping to establish a cross-border trading platform to promote business and gaming visitation between China and Philippines”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I am not persuaded that Mr Weidner’s evidence before the Tribunal, whether given in his Arbitration Declarations or in the course of the hearings, was dishonest or deceptive. Let me elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The assumption that resides in the plaintiffs’ reasoning is that whatever was disclosed in the FCPA Findings must have been practised in the context of the MSA as well. For reasons that will be detailed in a subsequent part of this judgment about the evidential value (or lack thereof) of the “new evidence” disclosed in the FCPA Findings, it is clear to me that such an assumption is unfounded (see [187]–[201] below). It suffices for now to state that the FCPA Findings are plainly and exclusively concerned with activities undertaken by an entity different from Solaire – that is, LVS. They are also concerned with a different time frame. In fact, I find that the FCPA Findings do not disclose fraud (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no bribery or corruption) in the defendants’ management of LVS, much less Solaire under the MSA (see [201]). In the absence of strong and cogent evidence of fraud, the evidential leap that the plaintiffs invite this court to make and conclude is untenable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged concealment by Paul Hastings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiffs also argue that Paul Hastings had failed to disclose to the plaintiffs or the Tribunal the involvement of Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in the LVS investigations. This alleged concealment of information by Paul Hastings is two-pronged: (a) how it dishonestly allowed the defendants to make certain false representations in the course of the parties’ relationship; and (b) how it dishonestly concealed various documents, the result of which essentially prevented the plaintiffs from presenting their case in the Arbitration. Thus, the plaintiffs argue that Paul Hastings’ conduct constitutes deceit and misrepresentation “in violation of professional ethic rules and undermined the integrity of the adversarial process”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Permitting the plaintiffs’ misrepresentations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I deal first with the allegations that Paul Hastings permitted the defendants to make certain incorrect representations. The plaintiffs refer to two particular episodes:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Paul Hastings permitted the defendants to falsely represent and warrant various terms in the MSA including representing that there were no investigations that could affect the defendants’ ability to perform their obligations even though when the MSA was being negotiated, investigations by US government authorities into LVS were already ongoing;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Paul Hastings “fully vetted” the first statement made by Mr Weidner on 15 August 2012 (see [119] above), which is wholly inconsistent with the FCPA Findings, and this constitutes white-washing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I find that there is no dishonest concealment of information by Paul Hastings in relation to the 15 August 2012 statement that amounts to procedural fraud. The several assertions by the plaintiffs that the solicitors of Paul Hastings were in breach of their ethical duty fall short of fraud. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In relation to the allegation that Paul Hastings permitted the defendants to misrepresent themselves in the MSA, weight was primarily placed on cl 10.2(G) of the MSA which states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.2 GGAM</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">GGAM represents and warrants as of the Effective Date that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(G) there is no litigation or proceedings pending or threatened against GGAM that could adversely affect the validity of this Agreement or the performance of GGAM of its obligations under this Agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The argument here essentially is that the DOJ Agreement and SEC Order show that there were investigations into LVS, which contradicts the defendants’ representation that there were no legal proceedings threatened. I do not accept that there was any breach of cl 10.2(G) of the MSA. The plain and unequivocal language of cl 10.2(G) of the MSA shows that the only entity whose conduct is of concern is GGAM. No mention is made of the conduct of LVS. Further, the LVS investigations (and the FCPA Findings) have nothing to do with the MSA, which is concerned with the management of Solaire. Therefore, it is patently unclear what litigation or proceedings were pending or threatened against the defendants (as legal entities) at the time it executed the MSA in September 2011. In any case, I accept that the lawyers from the Paul Hastings team that handled Mr Weidner’s representation in connection with the LVS Investigation (“PH Weidner Team”) had received specific assurances from the US government authorities conducting the LVS investigation that Mr Weidner was not a <span class="font-italic">target</span> of the investigation, prior to the vetting of the abovementioned statement. Thus, it cannot be said that there is any fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of Paul Hastings (simply on account of the apparent inconsistencies between the first statement dated 15 August 2012 and the FCPA Findings).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Essentially, the defendants’ submission is that prior to vetting the 15 August 2012 statement, Paul Hastings had received reliable information from the authorities and concluded thereon that Mr Weidner was not a subject of that investigation and was being treated solely as a cooperating witness.

In his third affidavit, Mr Patrizia states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I wish to clarify that (A) the United States government authorities have confirmed that they did in fact provide specific assurances that Mr. Weidner was not a “target” of the LVS investigations, and (B) the United States government authorities did <span class="font-weight-bold">not</span> directly state that Mr. Weidner was not a “subject” of the LVS investigations.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I pause to make two observations with regard to the evidence of alleged fraud by Paul Hastings. First, according to the defendants, the assurance received by Paul Hastings was premised on a conversation that Mr Patrizia (from the PH Arbitration Team) had with Mr Sullivan (from the PH Weidner Team) in 2014 in preparation for the Arbitration. It is regrettable that Mr Sullivan did not file an affidavit to attest to the assurance received from the US government authorities and the conclusion that was reached. Specifically, I find that the reasons furnished in Mr Patrizia’s affidavit for the conclusion that Mr Weidner was not a “subject” of the LVS investigations to be rather oblique. Second, I also note that Mr Patrizia’s evidence shifted in the course of the present application. His initial position in his first and second affidavits was that the US government had provided assurances that Mr Weidner was <span class="font-italic">neither a target nor a subject</span>. However, he clarified in his third affidavit that the assurance pertained only to Mr Weidner not being a target. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Nevertheless, the issues above do not rise to the level of strong and cogent evidence of fraud, or even evidence of fraud for that matter. The burden of proof remains with the plaintiffs to demonstrate procedural fraud by Paul Hastings. I should add that the plaintiffs’ own evidence also left much to be desired. For example, the following evidence of the plaintiffs’ expert, Mr Thomas Mason, is telling of the paucity of its allegation against Paul Hastings:

By August 2012, Mr. Sullivan of Paul Hastings had been retained by Mr. Weidner, and his function was to represent Mr. Weidner with respect to the on-going investigations…<span class="font-weight-bold">While the exact date of Mr. Sullivan’s retention is not provided by Mr. Patrizia, it is a fair inference that Mr. Sullivan would have been retained prior to August 2012, given that the investigation commenced no later than March 2011.

Also, as alluded earlier, the breach of any ethical duty, which is not the enquiry before me, is distinct from fraud – while the same set of facts that give rise to a finding of fraud (the central issue here) would more likely than not also support a finding of breach of ethical duty, the same cannot be said in the reversed situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 On the balance, I find that the conclusion that Mr Weidner was not a “subject” but rather a cooperating witness is neither unreasonable nor dishonest. In this regard, I am reminded that in assessing if there was dishonest concealment, the material question is whether at the time around 15 August 2012 when the first statement was released after having been reviewed by Paul Hastings, it can be said that Paul Hastings had dishonestly concealed information relating to Mr Weidner’s involvement in the LVS investigations or assisted the defendants in doing so.

</div> As noted earlier, the plaintiffs rely on the same set of facts to challenge the award on the ground of breach of natural justice, which I will consider at the end of this judgment separately. The plaintiffs refer to three categories of documents which they purport were withheld from them and/or the Tribunal: (a) a subset of documents of Mr Chiu; (b) documents of a non-party, Weidner Resorts; and (c) a subset of documents of GGAM’s joint venture partner, Cantor Fitzgerald and its Chairman and CEO, Mr Howard Lutnick (“Mr Lutnick”). It submits that Paul Hastings had “deliberately limited the search for documents in a way that subverted the Tribunal’s orders, standard arbitration practice, and the parties’ agreement to arbitrate”. This non-disclosure of documents constitutes “deceit and misrepresentation” by Paul Hastings.

Instead, the defendants produced documents only from the files of GGAM’s other executives. The defendants do not deny that they have not searched Mr Chiu’s personal files or produced them in discovery. They argue that it was Paul Hastings’ understanding that Mr Chiu performed his work in relation to Solaire exclusively at the behest and direction of GGAM’s principals.

</div> Accordingly, in respect of Mr Chiu, Paul Hastings collected the e-mails of persons at GGAM which sent to, received from or copied Mr Chiu. Paul Hastings believed it was unnecessary to collect documents from Mr Chiu’s personal e-mail account as these would most likely be duplicative. The defendants also highlight the prohibitive cost of searching, collecting and translating Mr Chiu’s communications, which would have been in Chinese and could not be effectively searched for using the English search term review database employed in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I do not see how there was any unlawful concealment by Paul Hastings in this regard. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sundaresh Menon CJ <span class="font-italic">et al</span>) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018), at para 11.031, the disclosure obligations in arbitration are not as wide as those in common law style litigation proceedings, where parties are under a continuing obligation to disclose all documents that are relevant and material to the case, including documents which have the potential to adversely affect the party’s own case or support the other party’s case. This comports with the International Bar Association rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (“the IBA Rules”), which applied to the present Arbitration. Article 3.1 of the IBA Rules states that “each Party shall submit to the Arbitral Tribunal and to the other Parties all Documents available to it <span class="font-italic">on which it relies</span>”. This distinction between disclosure obligations in litigation and arbitration has also been recognised in <span class="font-italic">BVU</span><span class="font-italic"> v BVX </span>at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In <span class="font-italic">BVU</span><span class="font-italic"> v BVX</span>, the plaintiff and defendant were in a supplier and purchaser relationship as part of a food supply project. The plaintiff-supplier commenced arbitration against the defendant-purchaser for breach of the agreement. The majority of the tribunal held in favour of the defendant. After the award was rendered, an employee of the defendant agreed to provide evidence on the facts and circumstances surrounding the formation of the agreement in question, which would go towards showing that the defendant had “deliberately put forward a false case in the [a]rbitration by concealing the true facts and withholding and suppressing crucial evidence” including the testimony of the said employee and key documents corroborating his testimony (at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The plaintiff applied to set aside the award on the grounds of fraud and public policy and also issued a subpoena to the said employee to attend court to produce the key documents. The central issue identified by Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) was whether the defendant’s deliberate decision not to call certain witnesses to give evidence and disclose certain internal documents, which it did not consider relevant to its case in the arbitration (but would have supported the plaintiff’s case), render the award liable to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The court held <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that there was no deliberate concealment aimed at deceiving the tribunal and also there was no requisite causative link between the alleged concealment and the decision. Notably, in holding that there was no deception by the defendant, Ang JC highlighted the following. First, there was no obligation on the defendant to call the employee as a witness or to adduce the key documents, as is consistent with the IBA Rules that governed the arbitration (at [61]). Second, the tribunal had thoroughly considered the question as to whether the employee should be called as a witness to the arbitration (at [62]). Third, the plaintiff could have requested for the documents that were the subject of the subpoena during the arbitration if it truly believed that those documents were crucial, but instead, its requests for production had been considerably narrower in scope (at [73]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It is plain to me that Paul Hastings’ conduct vis-à-vis Mr Chiu’s documents is not fraudulent. This was not a case where the defendants had failed to disclose the documents of Mr Chiu altogether. The plaintiffs’ unhappiness is with the scope of the defendants’ disclosure. Amongst the hundreds of e-mails involving Mr Chiu that have already been disclosed by the defendants to the plaintiffs, they include e-mails between Mr Chiu and Mr Chen Xiang,

In my view, the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to submit on the discovery of the documents but did not do so. The plaintiffs’ assertion that they could only have taken issue with Mr Chiu’s documents now in the light of the FCPA Findings lacks merit since the metadata showing that Mr Chiu was not the custodian of those documents was already available to the plaintiffs during the Arbitration. Furthermore, counsel for the plaintiffs in the Arbitration had first raised this issue with Mr Chiu’s documents in a series of  e-mail correspondence beginning on 14 June 2017 to Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed LLP, the defendants’ arbitral counsel that had taken over from the PH Arbitration team shortly after the liability phase.

Nonetheless, given the breadth of the plaintiffs’ arguments and submissions, I will comment on the materiality requirement first. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 For the sake of argument, assuming procedural fraud was made out on the evidence, the FCPA Findings do <span class="font-italic">not</span> satisfy the materiality requirement: they do not constitute material information that would substantially impact the making of the Partial Award or information so material that earlier discovery of it would have prompted the Tribunal to rule in favour of the plaintiffs ([105]–[106] above). Thus, it cannot be said that the Tribunal’s decision would have been different or that the Arbitration would have proceeded on an entirely different basis as the plaintiffs so argue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Not any or every case of fraud would impugn a judgment or award. As alluded earlier, even where fraud is proven, there must be sufficient degree of connection between the fraud and the award that is being enforced for the ground of public policy under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law to be engaged: The English decision in <span class="font-italic">Sinocore International Co Ltd v RBRG Trading (UK) Ltd </span>[2019] 1 All ER (Comm) 810 (“<span class="font-italic">Sinocore</span>”) is illustrative. This degree of connection test demonstrates that fraud does not unravel all and is in substance no different from the concepts of materiality and “causative link” adverted to above (see [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 By way of illustration, in <span class="font-italic">Sinocore</span>, the plaintiff, Sinocore, had agreed to sell goods to the defendant, RBRG to be shipped from China to Mexico. On instruction from RBRG, the bank purported to issue an amendment to the letter of credit so that the shipment period was changed. Subsequently, Sinocore’s collecting bank requested payment under the letter of credit and presented forged bills of lading. RBRG commenced arbitration proceedings for Sinocore’s breach of contract. The arbitral tribunal held that the fundamental cause of the termination of the contract and Sinocore’s failure to obtain payment was RBRG’s unilateral amendment of the letter of credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 RBRG sought to resist the recognition and enforcement of the award on the ground that it would be contrary to public policy under s 103(3) of the English Arbitration Act 1996 because of the forged bills of lading. Both the English High Court and the English Court of Appeal upheld the arbitral award. The Court of Appeal found that the degree of connection between Sinocore’s fraud in presenting forged bills of lading and its claim for enforcement of the award was not sufficient to engage public policy or, if it was engaged, was also insufficient to justify the refusal of enforcement on public policy grounds (at [30]). The decision <span class="font-italic">Sinocore </span>thus demonstrates this high watermark for proving fraud and the necessary nexus between the alleged fraud and the tribunal’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 A considerable body of submissions was marshalled by the plaintiffs in support of how the FCPA Findings would have a material effect on the Tribunal’s decision.

At its highest, the FCPA Findings implicate Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in the conduct of three transactions, pertaining to LVS’ violations of the FCPA Accounting Provisions but not the Anti-Bribery provisions. Consequently, I find that there is no sufficient degree of connection between the alleged fraud by the defendants and the Partial Award. I say this for a number of reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 As a preliminary point, it is apposite to recall that in the SEC Order, LVS settled the matter “without admitting or denying the findings herein” (see [74] above). Thus, the significance of the SEC Order is that LVS cannot challenge the alleged facts in any proceedings brought by SEC but it can do so in a proceeding brought by a party other than the SEC.

</div> The SEC Order and the DOJ Agreement are both negotiated documents between the US government and LVS that contain allegations based on the US government’s view of the evidence, including its inferences and extrapolations from the evidence. The findings itself were not placed before a court, an independent tribunal or fact-finder to evaluate the sufficiency of underlying evidence or its appropriateness. I also note that Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu were not parties to the FCPA Findings and to that extent, had no participation in the negotiations between LVS and the authorities that resulted in the documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Secondly, no charges were brought by the DOJ or administrative actions brought by the SEC against Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu, in particular under the Anti-Bribery Provisions of the FCPA. As noted by Mr Urofsky, the statutory limitation period for filing charges against both Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu lapsed at the end of 2017 for the alleged conduct that occurred between 2006 and 2009.

In addition, the legislation amended the Securities Exchange Act’s penalty provisions to include penalties for violations of the Anti-Bribery Provisions: Securities Exchange Act § 32(c). The second section of the FCPA applies the same prohibitions to US business entities and individuals who are not covered by the Securities Exchange Act provisions, which is immaterial for the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In the SEC Order, LVS violated Securities Exchange Act § 13(b)(2)(A) for its failure to<span class="font-italic"> </span>“<span class="font-italic">in reasonable detail, </span><span class="font-italic">accurately and fairly reflect</span> the purpose of the payments” in its books and records, and Securities Exchange Act § 13(b)(2)(B) for failing to “<span class="font-italic">devise and maintain a reasonable system of internal accounting controls</span> over operations in Macau and China to ensure that access to assets was permitted and that transactions were executed in accordance with management’s authorization” (see [83] above).

While there are some references to bribery (“a region known to be high risk for corruption” and “environment where significant bribery risks were present”), nowhere in the FCPA Findings is it stated that LVS or its directors themselves were directly involved in bribery. That LVS operated in those settings is simply too flimsy a basis for a finding of fraud which is a serious allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Fourth<span class="font-weight-bold">, </span>the circumstances surrounding the production of the FCPA Findings also diminishes its evidential value for the purposes of the present proceedings. I say this for two inter-related reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 It cannot be denied that on a systemic and practical level, there are various incentives available to LVS for entering into such agreements with the DOJ and SEC. In this regard, Mr Urofsky’s evidence is that a corporation that is intent on settlement (as opposed to litigation) would generally have very little or no incentive to contest the factual assertions contained in the FCPA Findings. It would likewise have little incentive to seek and include contrary or exculpatory evidence concerning the conduct under investigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I am inclined to accept Mr Urofsky’s evidence. A party may seek to settle a dispute for any number of reasons which do not relate to his legal liabilities or his views of them: <span class="font-italic">Lim Tjoen Kong v A-B Chew Investments Pte Ltd</span> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 168 at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and Another</span> [2010] SGHC 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span>”) at [15]. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span>, it was found that offers to settle did not amount to an admission of liability, in the context of protecting the “without prejudice” rule and allowing parties to speak freely in settlement negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 The DOJ for one offers considerable incentives to companies to cooperate and settle a variety of regulatory infringements instead of litigating issues of fact and liability. In the present case, LVS received a 25% discount off the bottom of the US Sentencing Guidelines range for the monetary penalty imposed on it, as stated explicitly in the DOJ Agreement.

</div> as well as his first statement given on 15 August 2012 to the plaintiffs, where he stated that “I had serious disagreements and concerns with company leadership, which I voiced to the board and ultimately led to my decision to resign” (see [120]). When considered with the earlier point about the availability of incentives to LVS in the context of investigations by the SEC and DOJ, some caution must be taken in according undue weight to the FCPA Findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 I hasten to add that none of the above should be construed as deprecating the quality of the SEC Order or DOJ Agreement in and of themselves. The present enquiry is a <span class="font-italic">specific</span> one that is concerned with assessing their particular relevance for the purposes of imputing actual fraud on the defendants, which the plaintiffs seek to do herein. Cogent and compelling evidence is needed to make good an allegation of fraud or dishonesty. On a holistic assessment of the nature and evidential value of the FCPA Findings, noting in particular that the FCPA Anti-Bribery Provisions were not breached and the fact that neither prosecution nor administrative action were initiated against Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu, I find that the plaintiffs have not discharged their burden of proof that LVS or its directors (Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu) had bribed Chinese government officials and state-owned entities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">In Solaire</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 As noted earlier, the plaintiffs aver that the FCPA Findings supposedly reveal that Mr Weidner’s strategies in Solaire were “strikingly similar” to those developed at LVS which involved the same Chinese governmental officials (through CLO) and Mr Weidner’s right-hand man, Mr Chiu. As such, notwithstanding the foregoing problems vis-à-vis the FCPA Findings in the context of LVS, the plaintiffs argue that fraud must have been practised by the defendants in Solaire as well. The plaintiffs submit that the “government-led, top-down junket approach” strategies which Mr Weidner testified he was pursuing to drive junkets and VIPs to Solaire, in reality, involved acts of bribery.

</div> The plaintiffs employed the language associated with <span class="font-italic">Boardman</span> <span class="font-italic">v DPP </span>[1975] AC 421 (“<span class="font-italic">Boardman</span>”) to determine the probative value of similar facts. In that case, evidence of facts that were so strikingly similar to the facts of the offence charged as to be of probative value was held to be admissible at the discretion of the court. I will however refrain from applying the legal definition in <span class="font-italic">Boardman</span> to the plaintiffs’ argument since no specific reference was made either to the case itself or the principles applicable to similar fact evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The ramp-up period </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Before I consider the plaintiffs’ argument about striking similarity of facts, there is a threshold problem with the plaintiffs’ submission that the FCPA Findings constitute evidence of fraud practised in Solaire. This pertains to the Tribunal’s finding regarding the ramp-up period that was at play in the performance of the MSA. One of the arguments raised by the plaintiffs in the context of the Causal Fraud Issue before the Tribunal was that “[n]ot a single VIP player has been identified as having come to Solaire as a direct result of Mr. Weidner’s ‘leveraging’” despite the defendants’ assurances of their strong relationships with the junket operators. It was also argued in the context of the Termination Issue that the defendants had failed to submit business and marketing plans that met prudent industry practice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The Tribunal was of the view that the plaintiffs’ arguments above were unmeritorious because the parties had envisioned an extended runway for attracting junket operators to Solaire.

The respondent there had commenced arbitration against the appellant in connection with a contract between the parties. After the notice of arbitration had been filed, the appellant lodged a complaint with the Thai prosecution authority alleging that parties associated with the respondent had induced it to enter into the underlying contract through fraud. This resulted in criminal proceedings against the relevant parties on charges of fraud and forgery. While the criminal proceedings were underway, the appellant and respondent signed a Concluding Agreement whereby the parties agreed that upon the withdrawal and/or discontinuation and/or termination of the said proceedings, the appellant would pay the respondent a sum of US$470,000 whereupon each of them would take steps to terminate and withdraw <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> all claims against each other in the Arbitration. The appellant then withdrew its complaint and the Thai prosecution authority issued a non-prosecution notice. Nevertheless, the respondent considered the non-prosecution order to be insufficient to fulfil the appellant’s obligations under the Concluding Agreement (at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Subsequently, when the appellant sought to terminate the arbitration on the grounds of the Concluding Agreement, the respondent alleged that the agreement was null and void on the grounds of duress, undue influence and<span class="font-italic"> </span>illegality. Importantly, the Tribunal then decided by way of an interim award that the Concluding Agreement was valid and enforceable and was <span class="font-italic">not</span> illegal as it did not require the stifling of prosecution. Dissatisfied, the respondent attempted to set aside the interim award, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>on the ground that the Concluding Agreement was against the public policy of Singapore under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 At first instance, the High Court judge set aside the interim award on the basis that the Concluding Agreement was an agreement to stifle the prosecution of charges and was hence contrary to the public policy of Singapore. On appeal, Chan Sek Keong CJ held as follows (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the Judge was not entitled to reject the Tribunal’s findings and substitute his own findings for them. On the facts of this case, s 19B(1) of the IAA calls for the court to give deference to the factual findings of the Tribunal. The policy of the IAA is to treat IAA awards in the same way as it treats foreign arbitral awards where public policy objections to arbitral awards are concerned, even though, in the case of IAA awards, the seat of the arbitration is Singapore and the governing law of the arbitration is Singapore law. Arbitration under the IAA is international arbitration, and not domestic arbitration. That is why s 19B(1) provides that an IAA award is final and binding on the parties, subject only to narrow grounds for curial intervention. <span class="font-weight-bold">This means that findings of fact made in an IAA award are binding on the parties and cannot be reopened except where there is fraud, breach of natural justice or some other recognised vitiating factor.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 This position has since been echoed by the Court of Appeal recently in <span class="font-italic">Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 131. Briefly put, one of the grounds for setting aside pursued by the appellant there was that the Master Agreement in question was illegal and contrary to public policy. The Court of Appeal dismissed the argument as such (at [99]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before we can consider the applicability and scope of Singapore public policy, however, [the appellant] has first to establish that the Master Agreement and the other agreements were illegal under their governing law. Such an issue would be pre-eminently one for the Tribunal to decide based on the facts and law before it as it was the forum concerned with the validity of the underlying obligations. [the appellant] did not put this issue before the Tribunal. Notwithstanding that, the Tribunal did look into the question and found that the Master Agreement clearly showed “no sign of illegality or even in the slightest [way], indicate that such Agreement and/or Agreements are contrary to public policy”. <span class="font-weight-bold">That finding is binding on the parties and [the appellant] cannot challenge it before this court as the court of the arbitral seat. It is well established that a finding of fact by an arbitral tribunal cannot be re-opened</span> by the supervisory court as the Judge observed, relying on <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span> … In these circumstances, there is no need to consider public policy at all. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 It is clear from the Partial Award that the Tribunal found, or at least, accepted that no junkets came to Solaire as a result of the defendants’ efforts. This is notwithstanding the fraud or corruption that the plaintiffs now allege. In the plaintiffs’ own rejoinder filed in the Arbitration, it was accepted that it was the <span class="font-italic">plaintiffs</span> themselves that had brought VIP players or junket operators to Solaire, not the defendants.

</div> Therefore, while I accept that the Tribunal had declined the plaintiffs’ Request for Reconsideration of the Partial Award in the light of the FCPA Findings, and to that extent, did not take an explicit position on the fraud that the plaintiffs now allege against the defendants, the factual findings in the Partial Award, based on the plaintiffs’ own evidence, cannot be criticised just because the plaintiffs now mount a different case in OS 1432.

When asked by the Tribunal, Mr Weidner testified in the liability hearing as to the role of Dr Chen Xiang and the CLO vis-à-vis the procurement of a major Macanese junket operator named SunCity to Solaire as such:

The Spectrum Report goes on to note that the time period in which the two payments of US$25,000 were made from GGAM to Sahara ASF (“Sahara Payments”) was between April and early June 2013 and corresponded precisely with the period of time when Dr Chen Xiang had been actively assisting GGAM in its efforts to develop relationships with junket operators in Macau. In doing so, the plaintiffs seek to draw similarities between these unexplained transactions and Mr Chiu’s authorisation of several suspicious payments at LVS as stated in the Statement of Facts of the DOJ Agreement (see above at [189]).

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 In fairness to the plaintiffs, the circumstances surrounding the Sahara Payments along with Mr Weidner’s and Mr Chiu’s behaviour, are arguably suspicious. However, that is as far as the evidence provided by the plaintiffs can show. The plaintiffs still have not proven what the transactions were for. Further, it is insufficient to draw an inference of bribery just because the key individuals involved in the breaches of the Accounting Provisions in the FCPA Findings (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu) and the consumer base (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> junket operators) are the same as those in Solaire. The FCPA Findings make no findings with regards to Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in respect of the strategies deployed at Solaire or the Sahara Payments for that matter. They also make no mention of junket operations at all. The FCPA Findings pertain to misconduct by LVS, a different company from GGAM, in a different venture (LVS, not Solaire), in a different country (China, not the Philippines), which occurred from 2006 to 2009, four years prior to the opening of Solaire in 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200  The strategies employed in LVS, which were impugned in the FCPA Findings are also clearly different from those employed in Solaire. It will be recalled that the FCPA Findings concern three specific transactions (only two are mentioned in the DOJ Agreement): the Basketball Team transaction, the Adelson Centre transaction and the Macau Operations transaction (see [78]–[82]). On the other hand, GGAM’s strategies for delivering VIP customers to Solaire did not involve any similar transactions to those highlighted in the FCPA Findings. Moreover, all that was mentioned in the DOJ Agreement was the limited role of the CLO: in 2006, the Consultant was first retained by LVS and introduced by a high-level person with the CLO in Macau. The plaintiffs have also yet to establish positively that the Consultant in LVS was Dr Chen Xiang in Solaire. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Therefore, I find that the FCPA Findings do not, on a balance of probabilities, prove that Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu, whilst in LVS, were involved in bribing Chinese government officials and state-owned entities. There are insufficient factual similarities between the operations in LVS and Solaire. It must be borne in mind that the court must take a careful and cautious approach in utilising similar fact evidence with regard to establishing fraud and dishonesty: <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan and another v Johnny Lian Tian Yong</span> [2018] SGHC 169 at [276]–[278]. Especially for findings of fraud and dishonesty, I would be slow to draw an inference based on similar fact evidence, assumptions and unestablished facts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The violation of the FCPA of the nature set forth by the U.S. authorities by William Weidner and Eric Chiu who are senior officers of GGAM, and GGAM’s hiring Michael French as President and Chief Operating Officer of Solaire, a person whom they have previously fired for rigging a drawing and Mr. French’ failure to disclose this in his [Gaming Employment License] application are, to my mind, <span class="font-weight-bold">reasons enough for PAGCOR to disqualify GGAM from being involved in</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">gaming in the Philippines</span>. Had PAGCOR been aware of these facts, it would have <span class="font-weight-bold">required that Bloomberry dissociate itself </span>from Mr. Weidner, Mr. Chiu and Mr. French. <span class="font-weight-bold">In fact, PAGCOR would have required the immediate termination of the MSA if its continuation would not be possible without the involvement of Mr. Weidner, Mr. Chiu and Mr. French</span> or if it would allow a circumvention of the requirement that only persons of the highest integrity are allowed to participate in the operations of the Philippine gaming industry… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to the plaintiffs, this shows that PAGCOR would have required the termination of the MSA either because of the misconduct of Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu, or the hiring of Mr French without disclosing his unethical conduct in LVS, which had resulted in fines imposed by Nevada’s Gaming Control Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 I disagree. The text of cl 15.1(f) of the MSA makes clear that a ground for valid termination arises where there is a final order that is not “remedied within the cure period as may be allowed by PAGCOR”. At best, Mr Sarmiento’s evidence is that the information contained in the FCPA Findings might have been sufficient to disqualify GGAM. While that conduct relates only to LVS, PAGCOR would presumably be entitled to take into account past conduct in its assessment of an applicant’s suitability in managing such facilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 However, Mr Sarmiento stops short of saying that the misconduct of Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in LVS would have resulted in a final and irremediable order, as contemplated in cl 15.1(f) of the MSA. Indeed, I do not think an irremediable order would have arisen for two inter-related reasons. For one, Mr Sarmiento’s report states that in the counterfactual scenario, PAGCOR would likely have required the first plaintiff to “dissociate itself from Mr Weidner, Mr Chiu and Mr French”. In other words, if the individuals “implicated” in the LVS investigations or other forms of misconduct were removed from the defendants and not involved in the MSA, PAGCOR may at the very least have considered allowing the defendants’ application to be involved  in the Philippines gambling sector. Furthermore, cl 15.1(g) of the MSA essentially provides that it is not a ground for termination where Mr Weidner ceases to be the CEO of GGAM, if the other principals “continue as a senior officer of GGAM actively involved in the performance of GGAM’s obligations”. Therefore, should the situation arise that Mr Weidner is “dissociated” from Solaire, cl 15.1(f) would not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>justify termination in the light of cl 15.1(g).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Fifth, I also have difficulty with the plaintiffs’ argument that the undisclosed misconduct of Mr French when taken together with the new revelations of misconduct by other individuals in GGAM, constitute a valid ground of termination. The premise of this submission is that the Tribunal had found that Mr French’s conduct (that he was previously fired for rigging a drawing and failed to disclose this in his Gaming Employment License application with PAGCOR) was an isolated event and that “there is no other evidence of unethical conduct by GGAM”.

</div> Consequently, the Tribunal found that there was no breach of cl 2.5 of the MSA, which essentially requires the defendants to act in accordance with the highest standards of business ethics (the “Standard of Care” proviso).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Notwithstanding the FCPA Findings indicate some wrongdoing by Mr Weidner and Mr Chiu in LVS<span class="font-italic"> </span>confined to the Accounting Provisions, I do not consider them to be material for the purposes of the Standard of Care proviso in the MSA, when considered in the totality of the circumstances. The same reasons explicated above in the section on the evidential value of the FCPA Findings are applicable here (see [167]–[184]). Importantly, I note also that the Tribunal dismissed the plaintiffs’ argument because (a) it was not pleaded; (b) it was not submitted that Mr French’s unethical conduct itself was a breach of cl 2.5 of the MSA; and (c) that misconduct was not known by the plaintiffs at the point of termination. In any case, the Tribunal expressed reservations about whether that conduct would fall within the ambit of cl 2.5 of the MSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Finally, I also reject the argument that the FCPA Findings show that the defendants violated the requirement to perform its obligations through the Management Team pursuant to cl 2.4(a) of the MSA.

</div> In my view, this argument is unsupported by any evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 It is unclear to me how anything in the DOJ Agreement or the SEC Order suggests that the defendants have operated outside the Management Team framework stipulated by the MSA.

It follows also from the foregoing analysis that there was a good reason for non-disclosure of the information relating to the FCPA Findings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-availability of evidence: is this a legal requirement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 In the light of my finding that there is no procedural fraud in the first place and that in any case, the FCPA Findings do not satisfy the requirement of materiality, I need not express a view on the legal requirement of non-availability of evidence at the time of the Arbitration. I am, however, satisfied that the new evidence to demonstrate fraud was not available or could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of the Arbitration in this case. The FCPA Findings were not in existence at the time of the Arbitration. The question of the plaintiffs’ due diligence, if any, does not arise in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Suffice to say for now that <span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Dongwoo </span>and <span class="font-italic">BVU v BVX </span>suggest that this requirement of due diligence applies in an unattenuated manner despite the allegation of fraud. A more relaxed position however appears to be taken in <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul, deceased, and others v Ching Pui Sim and others </span>[2011] 3 SLR 869, a case pertaining to the setting aside of judgments in cases of fraud. Steven Chong J, as he then was, noted that the court would “generally expect the applicant alleging fraud to adduce new evidence which could not have been discovered at the time of trial with due diligence” (at [41]). However, it is stated that this non-availability requirement “ought not to be imposed rigidly such as to cause injustice in a situation where fresh evidence uncovers fraud on the other party”. This represents at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> point of apparent divergence between the principles governing the setting aside of judgments and the resisting of enforcement of arbitral awards in the cases of fraud that is best left to another occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 I note that the English position in a recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Takhar v Gracefield Developments Ltd and ors </span>[2019] UKSC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Takhar</span>”) appears to go even further. The Supreme Court there was concerned with an application to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud. After considering the divergent authorities in the lower courts, Lord Kerr, with whom the majority agreed, held that where a judgment had been procured by fraud, and no allegation of fraud was raised at the trial, there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> <span class="font-italic">requirement</span> that the evidence of the fraud could not have been obtained before the first trial by exercise of reasonable diligence (at [46]). The court qualified this conclusion by stating that where a deliberate decision had been taken not to investigate the possibility of fraud in the first trial, even if that had been suspected, the court will exercise its discretion whether to allow the setting aside application (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Resisting enforcement under Art 36(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)(ii) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">of the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 As explained at the outset of this judgment, the plaintiffs also rely on a distinct ground of being unable to present their case to resist enforcement of the Partial Award under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law.

The typical scenarios being those where there has been a lack of proper participation or proper representation in the proceedings that is attributable to the arbitral tribunal or extraneous circumstances beyond the parties’ control (<span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL 2012 Digest of Case Law on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</span> (United Nations, 2012) at p 178). I understand the plaintiffs’ case, more appropriately, to be described as one where they were arguably deprived of an opportunity to present a <span class="font-italic">different </span>case rather than one where there were unable to present their case <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Therefore, it is difficult to see <span class="font-italic">how</span> the <span class="font-italic">audi alteram partem </span>rule has been breached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In addition, it bears reiterating, with respect to the plaintiffs’ accusations of suppression of documents by Paul Hastings, that a tribunal’s ruling in accordance with the rules of the arbitration on discovery or admissibility of evidence after hearing the parties cannot, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, constitute evidence that the party was therefore unable to present its case: <span class="font-italic">Dongwoo </span>at [55]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 I also find that there is also no foundation to the plaintiffs’ allegations of the defendants’ interference during the hearings. From my examination of the transcript in the Arbitration, the purported instances of interference appear to be nothing more than the usual cut-and-thrust of oral advocacy. I also note that at the close of the liability hearing, the Tribunal invited the plaintiffs to ventilate their complaints concerning the procedure of the Arbitration. The Tribunal, in the Annex to the Partial Award, had comprehensively addressed the plaintiffs’ complaints on procedural fairness. None of those complaints touched on the alleged inappropriate interference by the defendants’ counsel, which the plaintiffs have now raised.

In the absence of any finding of fraud, it cannot be said that the FCPA Findings have any material effect on either the arguments that were advanced in the Arbitration as to the Causal Fraud Issue and Termination Issue, or that the Arbitration would have proceeded differently altogether.
