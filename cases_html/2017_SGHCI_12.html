Following submissions on behalf of Graceland, the Plaintiff, Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”) and the Second Defendant in Counterclaim (“Mr Wolfe”), I informed the parties of my decision to grant Graceland leave to amend its defence and counterclaim, apart from the proposed amendments in para 8, the last sentence of para 12, para 15.7, para 26 and para 44. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Thereafter, counsel on behalf of Graceland sought to advance what were described as “further arguments” pursuant to s 28B(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) in relation to the proposed amendments which I had disallowed, as set out in its letter to the Registry dated 27 December 2017. However, attached to this letter was a new draft amended defence and counterclaim which included additional proposed amendments. By its letter dated 28 December 2017, counsel on behalf of Macquarie submitted that such “further arguments” should be refused. In the event, I decided to have a further oral hearing in relation to such further arguments and the additional proposed amendments. That hearing took place on 8 January 2018 (the “second hearing”). In light of the further arguments, I decided to grant Graceland further leave to amend, as set out below, in respect of certain of the proposed amendments. However, other proposed amendments remained in a form which were, in my view and for various reasons, ambiguous or unsatisfactory. For that reason, I decided to give Graceland’s counsel a further opportunity to serve a yet further draft amended defence and counterclaim with a view to ensuring that Graceland’s case was properly pleaded without uncertainty and ambiguity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Following the service of that further draft, it was unfortunately necessary to have a yet further oral hearing to hear further arguments and to finalise matters. That hearing took place on 10 January 2018 (the “third hearing”). In the event, at that hearing, I gave leave to amend the defence and counterclaim in a final form as referred to below and as subsequently extracted by the Registry. These are my brief reasons for the various decisions which I have taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The application for amendment of pleadings was originally issued on behalf of Graceland by Summons No 41 of 2017 dated 28 November 2017 supported by an affidavit of Sun Jiawen. Thereafter, there was served an affidavit of Amber Riley dated 7 December 2017 on behalf of Macquarie. On 12 December 2017, Graceland filed and served a second affidavit of Sun Jiawen in response, as well as its written submissions in support of the application. This was followed by Macquarie’s written submissions on 18 December 2017 in opposition to the application. Finally, on 19 December 2017, Graceland filed its written submissions in reply. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In summary, Graceland submitted that the proposed amendments were necessary to ensure that the relevant issues and facts would be fully canvassed at trial and/or for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. Further, the proposed amendments would not cause surprise to Macquarie and Mr Wolfe, or give rise to any form of prejudice. For instance, the proposed amendment in para 13 of the defence and counterclaim concerned a potential fertiliser derivative transaction (“the proposed DAP transaction”) which had been addressed in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of Mr Liu Zhongjin filed on behalf of Graceland, the expert report of Mr Darrell Ingram filed on behalf of Graceland, and the expert report of Mr Joseph Bauman filed on behalf of Macquarie. From these documents, it was submitted, Macquarie would have known all along what Graceland’s case was. Graceland therefore asserted that the proposed amendments were simply clarificatory in nature, and did not materially change the complexion of its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Macquarie made several points in opposition to Graceland’s application. I should mention that underlying much of Macquarie’s written submissions was the suggestion that Graceland had commenced the present application in bad faith, with a view to seeking to vacate the trial dates fixed for 19–23 February 2018. However, as I made it clear to the parties during the first hearing that those trial dates would remain save for any exceptional circumstances, that objection fell away. Macquarie’s oral submissions therefore focused primarily on two points: Graceland’s failure to provide an adequate explanation for the lateness of its application, and Graceland’s egregious conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On the first point, Macquarie pointed out that Graceland had not explained its reasons for bringing the amendment application beyond stating that “part of the impetus” for doing so was my prior decision in Summons No 32 of 2017.

</div> I had there denied Graceland’s application for specific discovery of Macquarie’s internal correspondence relating to the proposed DAP transaction, on the basis that the relevance of the proposed DAP transaction had not been properly spelt out in Graceland’s pleadings. Macquarie submitted that the lack of proper explanation for the application and its lateness prevented the court from deciding on the proper consequential directions or cost orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On the second point, Macquarie raised, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following arguments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The proposed amendments raised allegations that were based on facts entirely within Graceland’s knowledge or possession, control or power.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Graceland had previously represented to this court, via the proposed case management plan filed in the parties’ joint case management bundle dated 10 July 2017, that it did not intend to amend its pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The proposed amendments in paras 13, 16, 20.1 and 33.3 of the defence and counterclaim sought to introduce the very particulars that Graceland had earlier refused to provide pursuant to Macquarie’s letter of request dated 24 March 2017. Macquarie had then asked for details of the “language” and “correspondence” that formed the basis of Graceland’s case for mistake and misrepresentation, but Graceland had responded that Graceland was “not entitled as the same goes to evidence”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Graceland’s proposed amendments were an attempt to take an impermissible second bite at the cherry and re-litigate an issue that has already been determined by the Singapore High Court. Macquarie had previously commenced an application to strike out Graceland’s defence and counterclaim. Macquarie’s appeal from the decision of the assistant registrar had been heard by Woo Bih Li J, who had, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, struck out para 9 of the defence and counterclaim which averred that no contract had been concluded between Macquarie and Graceland.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, the proposed amendments purported to put in issue again whether there was a binding contract between the parties, and what the terms of that contract were. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The proposed amendments were deficient. For instance, the proposed amendment at para 15.7, which referred to Graceland providing Macquarie with “commercially sensitive and confidential information belonging to Wengfu Group and [Graceland]” was vague.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I agreed with Macquarie that Graceland had displayed egregious conduct. Graceland’s application to amend its defence and counterclaim came very late in the day, close to the festive season and a mere eight weeks ahead of the trial fixed for February 2018. I also agreed with Macquarie that Graceland had had plenty of opportunities previously if they had wanted to make the necessary amendments, but they had either failed or refused to do so. As counsel for Macquarie, Mr Foo, correctly pointed out, Graceland had previously indicated to the court on at least one occasion that it was not going to make amendments to its pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I recognise that, in certain circumstances, such egregious conduct might, of itself, justify the refusal of any application for leave to amend. However, in my view, it is also necessary to consider what prejudice has or might be suffered by Macquarie if I were to allow the amendments proposed by Graceland, and whether such prejudice can be adequately compensated by an appropriate order as to costs (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loong</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [113]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I therefore asked Mr Foo at the first hearing where in its affidavit evidence or its written submissions Macquarie had dealt with the issue of prejudice. Mr Foo pointed me to the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Paragraphs 12 and 13 of Macquarie’s written submissions, which set out potential steps that Macquarie and Mr Wolfe “may well” need to take in response to the proposed amendments, and made the point that in view of the holiday season, Macquarie and Mr Wolfe “may well require additional time to confer with and instruct their respective solicitors.” I note, however, that the phrase “may well” is very tentative.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Paragraph 25(b) of the affidavit of Amber Riley, which stated that Macquarie did not have the opportunity to file an AEIC to address allegations raised in the proposed amendments to the defence and counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Paragraph 27 of the affidavit of Amber Riley, which stated that Macquarie would suffer prejudice in the form of “added expense and drain on management time” and “through having various Macquarie staff (including its legal, credit and internal document management teams) diverted to, among other things, providing responses to the [p]roposed [a]mendments and filing […] supplemental AEICs. This will inevitably impact Macquarie’s preparation for trial in February 2018”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I bore all the above in mind as I considered each of the major amendments proposed by Graceland.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The first major amendment application was in respect of para 8 of the defence and counterclaim. By this proposed amendment, Graceland sought to extend its denial of paras 7–13 of the statement of claim to paras 4–6 of the same. Although this amendment seemed at first blush to be a relatively small amendment as a matter of form, it was in truth potentially a very significant amendment because paras 4–6 of the statement of claim address the issues of when the parties entered into the commodity swap transaction in respect of 30,000 metric tonnes of urea fertiliser and where the terms of that agreement were set out. Linked to that was the proposed amendment in para 44 of the defence and counterclaim, by which Graceland sought to deny that any damages which Macquarie may be entitled to (which was denied) should be calculated on the basis of the 2002 International Swaps and Derivatives master agreement (“the ISDA agreement”), because parties had not negotiated and/or expressly agreed to adopt the terms of the ISDA agreement into any agreement between parties. At the end of the first hearing, my view was that the proposed amendments in paras 8 and 44 sought to raise entirely new issues. The suggestion that certain terms in the agreement were not negotiated and/or expressly agreed was, on the face of the pleadings, something entirely new. To be clear, I use the term “entirely new” bearing in mind that such issues might have once been a part of the original pleadings but, as the result of a previous judgment of Woo J, are no longer a part of the pleadings. It was for these main reasons that I originally concluded that, given the proximity to trial, to allow the proposed amendments in paras 8 and 44 would cause real prejudice to Macquarie and raise matters that could not be properly compensated by an order as to costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, in the letter dated 27 December 2017, counsel on behalf of Graceland brought to my attention certain matters which had not previously been raised. It is unnecessary to explain this in detail. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that in the course of argument during the second hearing, counsel on behalf of Graceland abandoned the application to deny para 4 of the statement of claim and, in effect, made plain that the purpose of the remainder of the proposed amendments to paras 8 and 44 of the defence and counterclaim was limited to putting in issue what were the terms of the contract pleaded by Macquarie. However, it seemed to me that this did not appear properly from the face of the proposed amendments; and that if that was indeed the intended purpose of these proposed amendments, Graceland should, at the very least, identify properly what its case was as to what the terms of the contract were – subject as always to its case on mistake. For these reasons, I set down a tight timetable for Graceland to set out fully such a case. As stated at [2] above, counsel for Graceland subsequently served a revised draft defence and counterclaim. Counsel on behalf of Macquarie objected to certain parts of this revised draft. Again, the details do not matter. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that it was for this reason that it was necessary to have the further third hearing. In the event, counsel for Graceland proposed certain further amendments to meet such objections and after hearing further argument, I was content to grant leave in the form as stated at [3] above. For the avoidance of doubt, I am satisfied that such amendment was necessary to identify properly the relevant issues and did not cause any prejudice to Macquarie which could not be compensated by an order for costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The second major amendment application was in respect of para 12 of the defence and counterclaim. Graceland sought to add a sentence at the end of the paragraph stating that it was “not aware that a bank could be a counterparty to a commodity derivative transaction”. On its face, this might again seem a relatively innocuous plea. However, in reality, it potentially raises considerable difficulty because it pleads the negative, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the absence of knowledge of a certain kind. I had, in the course of the first hearing, asked counsel for Graceland, Mr Wong, whether he could say that all documents in relation to that issue had already been disclosed. Mr Wong informed me that he could not answer that question directly, but that it would potentially require further disclosure and he would have to take further instructions from his client. Mr Wong said that at this stage, he could not say when any such disclosure could be made or what further steps would be taken. Mr Wong also recognised that there was a continuing obligation on his part to provide disclosure. Therefore, he needed to confer with his client and satisfy himself, as solicitor on record, that such proper disclosure had been given. Mr Wong told me that on his current instructions, Graceland has never carried out a commodity derivative transaction with a bank as a counterparty. Irrespective of whether that is the case, that does not, in my view, address the question of whether there are any documents as to what Graceland may or may not have been aware of. In such circumstances, given the proximity to trial and the absence of satisfactory assurances by Mr Wong, it originally seemed to me that there was very considerable potential for prejudice if I were to allow that plea to be introduced at this stage. Therefore, I originally refused leave in relation to the proposed amendment in para 12.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 However, following the first hearing, counsel for Graceland took further instructions and thereafter expressly confirmed in its letter dated 27 December 2017 that Graceland had been unable to locate any document which may be relevant and material to this issue. In light of such express confirmation and in the absence of any prejudice to Macquarie, I therefore decided to allow this proposed amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The third major amendment application was in respect of para 13 of the defence and counterclaim concerning the proposed DAP transaction. Although much lengthier than the other proposed amendments, most of that length came from the particulars to that paragraph, which were simply a recitation of particular correspondence between the parties. It seemed to me that there was much less difficulty with this amendment. Mr Wong informed me that Graceland had already provided all relevant documents in respect of the proposed DAP transaction. I was also informed that Macquarie had, in a previous case management conference on 24 October 2017, taken the position that the same had been provided. Mr Wong also pointed out that the proposed DAP transaction had been dealt with in affidavit evidence and expert reports (see [5] above). Even if that is not correct, based on the evidence or submissions submitted on behalf of Macquarie before me, I was of the view that there would not be great difficulty in dealing with those matters at trial. I did not think that, at least in relation to this point on the proposed DAP transaction, the matters mentioned at para 12 of Macquarie’s written submissions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, filing consequential amendments to their pleadings, seeking further and better particulars, requesting specific discovery and filing supplementary AEICs) would be as great a burden as Mr Foo suggested. I also did not consider that the amendment at para 13 would give rise to the need to conduct any particular investigations, but even if it did, I am satisfied that any further matters to be investigated would be a peripheral matter. Therefore, I allowed the amendment in relation to para 13 of the defence and counterclaim. Flowing from that, I also allowed the amendments in paras 14 and 15 of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The fourth major amendment application was in respect of paras 15.7 and 26 of the defence and counterclaim. These amendments concerned the alleged fiduciary relationship between Macquarie and/or Mr Wolfe and Graceland. I agreed with Macquarie that, as originally formulated prior to the first hearing, the proposed amendment at para 15.7 was far too vague and lacking in particulars. It did not identify what “commercially sensitive and confidential information” had been requested by and provided to Macquarie and/or Mr Wolfe by Graceland. On that basis alone, I was of the view that that paragraph was embarrassing for lack of particulars. The same must be said in respect of para 26 (as originally formulated), which utilised similar language. In an ordinary case, I might have allowed the amendments and granted the other party leave to ask for further particulars. However, given the proximity to trial in the present case, Graceland should have provided the necessary particulars at the outset. I therefore originally refused leave in relation to the proposed amendments in paras 15.7 and 26. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 However, the revised draft defence and counterclaim which Graceland served on 27 December 2017 did set out further particulars, and after considering the further arguments set out in the covering letter of that date and the further arguments raised at the second hearing, I decided to grant leave in respect of these proposed amendments, with some edits to the wording thereof which Mr Wong consented to. Once again, for the avoidance of doubt, I should make plain that I am satisfied that such amendment was necessary to identify properly the relevant issues and did not cause any prejudice to Macquarie which could not be compensated by an order for costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The final major amendment application was in respect of para 33.1 of the defence and counterclaim, which sought to refer to certain “follow-up phone conversations between Mr Wolfe and Mr Liu on 16 to 21 May 2014”. Mr Wong informed me that this matter had been addressed in an AEIC filed on behalf of Graceland while Mr Foo informed me that it had not been dealt with by Mr Wolfe in his AEIC. Mr Wong indicated that Graceland would not object to Macquarie leading additional evidence on this point. In light of Mr Wong’s assurances and Macquarie’s assent, it seemed to me that the appropriate course was to allow the amendment at para 33.1, subject to Mr Wolfe’s being able to serve a further AEIC dealing only with those follow-up phone conversations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is for these reasons that I ultimately granted Graceland leave to amend its defence and counterclaim as set out above and in the form extracted by the Registry. I also gave certain further directions as set out in my order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Although Graceland’s amendment application was eventually allowed in large part, it seemed to me that costs of the application and costs in relation to consequential amendments to the pleadings ought to be paid by Graceland to Macquarie and Mr Wolfe. This was in view of the lateness of the application, the fact that Graceland’s application had failed in part as well as Graceland’s egregious conduct which I have already mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 So far as costs in relation to consequential amendments were concerned, Macquarie and Mr Wolfe submitted that they were entitled to such costs and that the quantum could be dealt with at a later stage. Graceland also accepted that in principle, it should bear such costs in any event. I therefore awarded Macquarie and Mr Wolfe costs consequential upon the amendments in any event, with the quantum of costs reserved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As regards the costs of the application itself and the first hearing, parties relied on Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, the Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards in the Supreme Court of Singapore. That document provided, as a useful benchmark, that the quantum of costs typically awarded in relation to applications for amendments of pleadings ranges between $1,000 and $6,000. Macquarie submitted that in light of Graceland’s egregious conduct, it was entitled to costs at the very top end of the range. It thus sought a total of $8,000, which included $2,000 in disbursements. Counsel for Mr Wolfe, Mr Lim, submitted for $4,000 in costs on the basis that he had had to review the submissions filed by Graceland and Macquarie and prepare for the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In response to Macquarie, Graceland argued that costs at the top end of the range were reserved for full day hearings. Graceland therefore submitted that Macquarie should only be entitled to costs of $3,000, excluding reasonable disbursements. As regards Mr Wolfe, Graceland submitted that $4,000 in costs was “manifestly excessive” in light of the fact that no affidavit evidence or written submissions had been filed, nor any oral submissions made, on behalf of Mr Wolfe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The present application was an important one for Graceland and, in my view, also a heavy one. On each side, several affidavits were filed and the quantity of documents was extensive, approaching something in the order of 2,000 pages. Given that the application no doubt involved considerable work on Macquarie’s part, I agreed that Macquarie should be entitled to costs at the higher end of the scale. In relation to the first hearing, I therefore ordered that Graceland pay costs to Macquarie fixed at $6,000, including disbursements. However, I agreed with Graceland that Mr Wolfe’s claim for $4,000 was excessive. In relation to the first hearing, I therefore ordered that Graceland pay costs to Mr Wolfe fixed at $1,500, including disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As for the costs of the second and third hearings, I ordered Graceland to pay additional costs to Macquarie and Mr Wolfe in the total sum of $3,500 and $1,000 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><br/>Henry Bernard Eder <br/>International Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nish Kumar Shetty, Jerald Foo and Tay Jia Wei, Kenneth (Cavenagh Law LLP) for the plaintiff by original action and first defendant in counterclaim;<br/>Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Priscylia Wu Baoyi and Wong Zi Qiang, Bryan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant by original action and plaintiff in counterclaim; and<br/>Abraham Vergis and Lim Mingguan (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the second defendant in counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p><strong>24 January 2018</strong></p> <p><strong>Media Summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Singapore International Commercial Court Suit No 5 of 2017 (Summons No 41</strong></p> <p><strong>of 2017)</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Macquarie Bank Limited v Graceland Industry Pte Ltd</em> [2017] SGHC(I) 12</strong></p> <p><strong>______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Background facts</strong></p> <p>1             The dispute arises out of the defendant’s refusal to pay amounts that were<br/> allegedly due to the plaintiff as a consequence of the termination of an agreement<br/> involving a commodity swap transaction. Summons No 41 of 2017 was the<br/> defendant’s application under O 20 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev<br/> Ed) seeking leave to amend its defence and counterclaim, some eight weeks ahead of<br/> the trial on 19–23 February 2018.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>2             The plaintiff, Macquarie Bank Limited (“Macquarie”), is an Australian<br/> company and a global provider of banking and financial services. The second<br/> defendant in the counterclaim, Mr Stephen Becher Wolfe (“Mr Wolfe”) was, at the<br/> material time, a Senior Adviser in Macquarie’s Fixed Income, Currencies and<br/> Commodities Group. The defendant, Graceland Industry Pte Ltd (“Graceland”), is a<br/> Singapore company that engages in trading of phosphate-based chemical products.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>3             Sometime in 2014, Macquarie and Graceland entered into an agreement (“the<br/> Agreement”) which involved a commodity swap transaction regarding 30,000 metric<br/> tonnes of urea fertiliser (“the Transaction”). According to Macquarie, the Agreement<br/> incorporates some terms of the 2002 International Swaps and Derivatives Association<br/> Master Agreement (“ISDA Form”). Macquarie claims that Graceland breached the<br/> Agreement by failing to execute an ISDA Master Agreement by the stipulated date,<br/> and therefore that Macquarie had the right to terminate the Agreement. Macquarie<br/> thus claims $1,200,000, the amount allegedly owed to it by reason of the early<br/> termination, calculated in accordance with the terms of the ISDA Form.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>4             Graceland disputes the terms of the Agreement as pleaded by Macquarie. It<br/> also denies liability on other alternative bases. First, that Graceland had entered into<br/> the Agreement under a mistaken belief as to the nature of the Transaction (ie, that it<br/> was an exchange-traded transaction rather than an over-the-counter transaction with<br/> Macquarie as the counterparty). Second, that Macquarie and Graceland were mutually<br/> mistaken as regards the nature of the Transaction. Third, that Macquarie and/or Mr<br/> Wolfe breached the fiduciary duties they owed to Graceland. Fourth, that Macquarie<br/> and/or Mr Wolfe had made various fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations to<br/> Graceland and/or made material non-disclosures. Graceland counterclaimed for the<br/> loss and damage suffered as a result of the above.</p> <p><strong>The application</strong></p> <p>5             Graceland’s proposed amendments to its defence and counterclaim dealt with<br/> five major categories: (a) the terms of the Agreement, particularly whether the parties<br/> had agreed to adopt the terms of the ISDA Form in the calculation of the early</p> <p>termination amount; (b) Graceland’s knowledge on whether a bank could be a<br/> counterparty to a commodity derivative transaction; (c) particulars of correspondence<br/> relating to a potential fertiliser derivative transaction that had preceded the<br/> Transaction; (d) Graceland’s provision of certain commercially sensitive and<br/> confidential information to Macquarie on the latter’s request; and (e) certain phone<br/> conversations between Mr Wolfe and a representative of Graceland. Graceland argued<br/> that these amendments were necessary to ensure that relevant issues and facts would<br/> be fully canvassed at trial for the purpose of determining the real questions in<br/> controversy between the parties. Further, the proposed amendments were merely<br/> clarificatory in nature and would not cause surprise to or prejudice Macquarie.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>6             Macquarie opposed the application on the basis that Graceland had brought<br/> the application in bad faith with a view to seeking to vacate the trial dates. It also<br/> argued that Graceland had failed to provide an adequate explanation for the lateness<br/> of its application and that Graceland had demonstrated egregious conduct. On the<br/> latter issue, Macquarie highlighted, among other points, that Graceland had<br/> previously informed the court that it did not intend to amend its pleadings, the<br/> proposed amendments sought to introduce the very particulars that Graceland had <br/> previously refused to provide to Macquarie, were an attempt to re-litigate issues that<br/> had already been decided, and were deficient.<br/> <br/> </p> <p><strong>Procedural history</strong></p> <p><br/> 7             At the first hearing of the application on 21 December 2017, the court granted<br/> Graceland leave to amend its defence and counterclaim, apart from the proposed<br/> amendments relating to the categories (a), (b) and (d) mentioned at [5] above.<br/> Thereafter, Graceland sought to make further arguments pursuant to s 28B of the<br/> Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) in relation to those<br/> disallowed amendments and provided a revised draft defence and counterclaim. There<br/> was a further oral hearing on 8 January 2018 to hear those arguments and consider the<br/> proposed amendments. However, as the court considered some of the proposed<br/> amendments to be, for various reasons, ambiguous or unsatisfactory, the court granted<br/> Graceland a further opportunity to serve a further draft amended defence and<br/> counterclaim. A third hearing was convened on 10 January 2018 to finalise matters.</p> <p><br/> <strong>The decision</strong></p> <p><br/> 8             The court eventually granted Graceland’s amendment application in large part.<br/> However, having regard to Graceland’s egregious conduct, the lateness of the<br/> application and the fact that Graceland’s application had failed in part, the court held<br/> that Macquarie and Mr Wolfe were entitled to costs of the application, and costs<br/> consequential upon the amendments in any event.</p> <p><strong><br/> Reasons for the judgment</strong></p> <p><br/> 9             The court noted that in certain circumstances, an applicant’s egregious<br/> conduct could of itself justify the refusal of an application for leave to amend.<br/> However, it was also necessary to consider what prejudice has or might be suffered by<br/> the other party, and whether such prejudice could be adequately compensated by an<br/> appropriate order as to costs.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>10           The court had originally refused leave to amend in relation to category (a)<br/> because in its view, the amendments raised issues that were entirely new on the face<br/> of the pleadings. Given the proximity to trial, to allow such amendments would cause<br/> real prejudice to Macquarie that could not be properly compensated by an order as to<br/> costs. However, upon further arguments and Graceland’s abandonment of part of its<br/> amendment as originally proposed, the court allowed the amendments to the extent<br/> that they only put in issue what were the terms of the Agreement.<br/> <br/> </p> <p>11           The court had also originally refused leave to amend in relation to category (b)<br/> because during the first hearing, Graceland’s counsel was unable to provide the court<br/> with satisfactory assurances that all documents relevant to that issue had already been<br/> disclosed. Subsequently, Graceland’s counsel took further instructions and expressly<br/> confirmed in its letter to the court that Graceland had been unable to locate any<br/> further documents which may be relevant and material to this issue. Given the<br/> absence of prejudice to Macquarie, the amendment was allowed.</p> <p><br/> 12           In relation to category (c), the court took the view that allowing the<br/> amendment would not cause much prejudice to Macquarie. All of the relevant<br/> documentation had already been disclosed and the point had been dealt with in<br/> affidavit evidence and by expert reports filed by both sides. Thus, any consequential<br/> steps that Macquarie might need to take would not be a great burden.</p> <p><br/> 13           As for category (d), the court had originally refused leave because the<br/> proposed amendments were too vague and lacking in particulars. However, Graceland<br/> subsequently provided a revised draft and counterclaim which set out those further<br/> particulars. The court was satisfied that the amendment was necessary to identify<br/> properly the relevant issues and did not cause any prejudice to Macquarie which could<br/> not be compensated for by an order as to costs.</p> <p><br/> 14           Finally, in relation to category (e), the court allowed the amendment on the<br/> basis that Graceland would not object to Macquarie filing of a supplementary affidavit<br/> limited to only dealing with that proposed amendment. </p> <p> </p> <p>* This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
