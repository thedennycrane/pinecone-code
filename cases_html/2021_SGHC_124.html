</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I consider the defendant’s starting point and approach to be correct. This is not an application to set the award aside under either s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act or Art 34 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”). If it were, I would agree with the plaintiff that the parties’ arbitration agreement is the natural starting point. This is instead an application to set aside the plaintiff’s leave to enforce the award. This application therefore springs from the award, not from the parties’ arbitration agreement or from events during the arbitration. All of that is now water under the bridge. The correct starting point for determining whether the plaintiff can enforce this award must be the award itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I therefore adopt the defendant’s starting point and approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The questions to be answered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The defendant’s approach poses the following five questions for me to answer. The first four are substantive questions arising from the award. The fifth is a procedural question arising from the plaintiff’s conduct in the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for leave to enforce the award. The five questions are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the tribunal issue the award in favour of Hydralift or in favour of the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Is the use of Hydralift’s name for the respondent in the arbitration merely a mistake as to the name of the correct respondent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Is the plaintiff estopped by representations that it made to the defendant in the arbitration and in certain related litigation (see [125]–[126] below) from denying that the respondent in the arbitration is Hydralift?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Does the Contract prohibit the 2004 mergers from transferring Hydralift’s rights under the Contract to the plaintiff, including its rights under the arbitration agreement in the Contract?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Did the plaintiff make full and frank disclosure to the court when it applied <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> for leave to enforce the award?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Before I answer these five questions, I make three observations on the expert evidence before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The expert evidence on Norwegian law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The effect of a merger is a matter relating to the status of the companies involved. Hydralift, NOH and the plaintiff are all companies incorporated in Norway. The effect of the 2004 mergers is therefore governed by Norwegian law (<span class="font-italic">JX Holdings Inc and another v Singapore Airlines Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 988 (“<span class="font-italic">JX Holdings</span>”) at [21]–[22] and [43(b)]–[43(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Both parties have adduced substantial expert evidence on the applicable Norwegian law. The plaintiff’s expert is Mr Robert Sveen. The defendant’s expert is Mr Olav Fredrik Perland.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I make the following three observations about the expert evidence on Norwegian law before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 First, it is undisputed that Hydralift ceased to exist as a legal person from the moment it was struck off the Norwegian companies register as a result of its merger with NOH taking effect on 6 October 2004.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, there is no evidence that the effect of a merger under Norwegian law is that the transferee acquires the <span class="font-italic">name</span> of the transferor. In other words, there is no evidence that Norwegian law deems any use of Hydralift’s name on and after 6 October 2004 to be a reference to NOH and, on and after 15 October 2004, to be a reference to the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the effect of a change of name under s 28(6) of our Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Mr Sveen places great emphasis on the principle of “continuity” under Norwegian company law (see [158(b)] below).

</div>
</div> But he does not go so far as to say that the principle of continuity means that, once a merger takes effect under Norwegian law and the transferor ceases to exist, the transferor’s <span class="font-italic">name</span> is deemed by Norwegian law to point to the transferee. As soon as Hydralift ceased to exist, therefore, its name no longer pointed to a legal person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, on the evidence before me, the only name by which the plaintiff has ever been “formerly known” is the name “National Oilwell Norway AS” (see [8(d)]–[8(e)] above). Although the plaintiff merged with NOH, the plaintiff was never “formerly known” by NOH’s name. And although NOH had merged with Hydralift a few days earlier, the plaintiff was never “formerly known” by Hydralift’s name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is therefore factually wrong for the plaintiff to describe itself, as it does in the title to these proceedings, as being “formerly known as Hydralift AS”. Hydralift never changed its name to “National Oilwell Varco Norway AS”, whether directly or by any intermediate steps. It is, of course, true that the plaintiff absorbed the entire business of Hydralift via NOH. But that is not at all the same thing as the plaintiff having been formerly known by Hydralift’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I now turn to consider the five questions which I must answer to determine the ultimate issue on this application (see [19] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the tribunal issue the award in favour of Hydralift or the plaintiff?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The first question the defendant poses is whether the tribunal issued the award in favour of Hydralift or in favour of the plaintiff. I find that the tribunal intended to and did issue its award in favour of Hydralift and not in favour of the plaintiff. I make that finding for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, the award describes the respondent in the arbitration as the legal person who entered into the Contract with the defendant in 1996.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff did not. The plaintiff may have acquired Hydralift’s rights and obligations under the Contract by reason of the 2004 mergers. But the mergers do not change the historical facts of 1996 or operate to bring the plaintiff within this description.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, the award describes the respondent in the arbitration as being a legal person <span class="font-italic">other than</span> the plaintiff. The award refers to the respondent as simply “the Respondents”. And the award refers to the plaintiff by its full name, “National Oilwell Varco Norway AS”. The award therefore uses a different term for each, thereby indicating that it sees the plaintiff and Hydralift as two different legal persons. This is also evident from the way the award describes Hydralift’s sole factual witness in the arbitration, one Mr Frode Jensen:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">B.  The Respondents' Evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">133 As stated earlier at [87], Jensen was the only factual witness of the Respondents. … Jensen rose through the ranks and is now the managing-director of the <span class="font-italic">Respondents' parent company</span> National Oilwell Varco Norway AS.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This is the only capacity in which the award refers to the plaintiff: as the respondent’s parent company. The award does not refer to the plaintiff as the legal person who subsequently acquired all of Hydralift’s rights and obligations under the Contract following the 2004 mergers. That is for the simple reason that the plaintiff never told the tribunal about the 2004 mergers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Paragraph 133 of the award (see [32] above), coupled with the award’s description of the plaintiff only as the respondent’s parent company, establishes that the award rests on the following premises: (a) that Hydralift is the respondent in the arbitration; (b) that Hydralift is still in existence; and (c) that Hydralift is a subsidiary of the plaintiff. All of this necessarily implies that the award: (a) treats Hydralift as a different legal person from the plaintiff; and (b) does not consider the respondent in the arbitration to be the plaintiff. The award does not rest on either of the following premises: (a) that “National Oilwell Varco Norway AS” and “Hydralift AS” are alternative names for the same legal person; or (b) that the plaintiff is a transferee of Hydralift’s rights and obligations under the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For both of these reasons, I find that the tribunal intended to and did issue the award in favour of Hydralift, and not in favour of the plaintiff. The question which follows from this finding is whether the plaintiff is entitled to enforce an award which the tribunal intended to issue and did issue in favour of another legal person. The fact that Hydralift did not exist as a legal person even when the defendant commenced the arbitration is not material to this question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Answering this question requires me to consider the proper approach to enforcement under s 19 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The mechanical approach to enforcement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As it stood at the time of the plaintiff’s application, s 19 of the Act read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Enforcement of awards</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. An award on an arbitration agreement may, by leave of the High Court or a Judge thereof, be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or an order to the same effect and, where leave is so given, judgment may be entered in terms of the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The procedure for invoking s 19 of the Act is set out in O 69A r 6 of the Rules of Court. Order 69A r 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) defines the party seeking to enforce an award as “the creditor” and the person against whom it is sought to enforce an award as “the debtor”. I adopt the same terms in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Enforcement under s 19 is a two-step process. In the first step, the court grants the creditor leave to enforce the award. In the second step, the court enters judgment against the debtor on the award. It is only when judgment is entered that the award is formally put on the same legal footing as a judgment of the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The critical point about s 19 is that it does not empower an enforcing court to vary or deviate from the dispositive terms of the award at either of these two steps. Section 19 empowers the court to grant a creditor leave to enforce the award against a debtor only “in the same manner as a judgment or an order <span class="font-italic">to the same effect</span>” [emphasis added]. Further, s 19 empowers the court to enter judgment against the debtor only “<span class="font-italic">in terms of</span> the award” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Such a mechanical approach to enforcement under s 19 may appear unduly narrow and technical. But a mechanical approach is, in my view, dictated by the policy imperative of party autonomy. I say that for two reasons. First, parties who choose arbitration ought not to have any more or any fewer rights or obligations as against each other than those which have been determined in the award produced by their reference to arbitration. Second, no legal person can be held liable on an award unless it is a contracting party to the arbitration agreement invoked in the reference which has produced the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Further, it is also my view that the mechanical approach is dictated by the policy imperative of minimal curial intervention. I say that also for two reasons. First, it is wrong in principle for an enforcing court to do anything which might, even indirectly or unintentionally, alter the substance of the parties’ rights and obligations as determined in the award. Second, it is also wrong in principle for an enforcing court to go behind the dispositive terms of an award in order to analyse the tribunal’s reasons for arriving at those terms, even if the sole reason for doing so is simply to ensure that a proposed deviation from the dispositive terms of the award makes no change of substance to the parties’ rights and obligations as determined in the award. Both of these things would amount to a court intervening at the enforcement stage contrary to the spirit of Art 5 of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The only way to advance both of these policy imperatives is for the court to grant leave to enforce an award and to enter judgment thereafter in terms which mirror, precisely and mechanically, the dispositive terms of the award. That is why s 19 of the Act gives an enforcing court no power to vary or deviate from the dispositive terms of an award, however well-intentioned the desire to do so might be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This is the position in English law. Section 101 of the English Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (“the English Act”) is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 19 of the Act. Section 101 “makes it clear that the enforcement process is a mechanistic one, and that the court may simply give a judgment which implements the award itself”: Robert Merkin, <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Law </span>(Informa UK, March 2021 release) at para 19.48. Thus, for example, an English court has no power to give leave to enforce an award in favour of or against anyone other than the parties to the arbitration (Merkin at para 19.48):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It follows that the award cannot be enforced on terms not specified in the award. … In particular, an award can only be enforced against a losing party in the arbitration. The party successful in the arbitration is not, therefore, entitled to seek enforcement of the award against another person who is alleged in the enforcement proceedings to be the principal of the losing party in the arbitration. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The authority which Merkin cites for the mechanical approach is the decision at first instance of Gross J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro ASA v State Property Fund of Ukraine and others </span>[2002] EWHC 2120 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>”).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>, a tribunal issued an award against a number of legal persons including a single legal person named in the arbitration and in the award as “The Republic of Ukraine, through the State Property Fund of Ukraine”. But the court granted the creditor leave to enforce the award against, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, two separate legal persons: (a) the Republic of Ukraine; and (b) the State Property Fund of Ukraine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Gross J set aside the leave. He explained that the approach to granting leave to enforce an award must be mechanical for two reasons. First, the mechanical approach avoids the court having to go into the merits of the tribunal’s reasoning. Second, where the question is as to the identity of the person against whom the award is to be enforced, any other approach would amount to the court using the state’s sanctions to compel a legal person who was not a party to the arbitration and who is not the subject of the award to comply with the award (at [17]–[18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 … There is an important policy interest … in ensuring the effective and speedy enforcement of such international arbitration awards; the corollary, however, is that the task of the enforcing court should be as “mechanistic” as possible. Save in connection with the threshold requirements for enforcement and the exhaustive grounds on which enforcement of a New York Convention award may be refused … the enforcing court is neither entitled nor bound to go behind the award in question, explore the reasoning of the arbitration tribunal or second-guess its intentions. Additionally, the enforcing court seeks to ensure that an award is carried out by making available its own domestic law sanctions. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 Viewed in this light, as a matter of principle and instinct, an order providing for enforcement of an award must follow the award. No doubt, true “slips” and changes of name can be accommodated; suffice to say, that is not this case. Here it is sought to enforce an award made against a single party, against two separate and distinct parties. To proceed in such a fashion, necessarily requires the enforcing court to stray into the arena of the substantive reasoning and intentions of the arbitration tribunal. Further, enforcement backed by sanctions, is sought in terms other than those of the award. … In my judgment, this is all inappropriate territory for the enforcing court. The right approach is to seek enforcement of an award in the terms of that award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I therefore accept the defendant’s submission that the court’s approach to an application under s 19 of the Act ought to be and is a mechanical one. The pure mechanical approach is subject only to four qualifications. The first is that which Gross J himself mentions in [18] of <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>. The court may deviate from the terms of the award when granting leave to enforce it if the deviation does no more than correct a minor clerical error of the type which comes within the slip rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second qualification is that it must be the case that the court may deviate from the terms of the award when that is necessary to take into account matters which have occurred <span class="font-italic">after</span> the tribunal issued its award and became <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. Examples of such matters would be a post-award change of name or a post-award assignment or other transfer of the benefit of the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The third qualification is that the court may deviate from the terms of the award with the parties’ consent to the deviation. Arbitration being founded on consent, a deviation from the terms of the award supported by the parties’ consent at the time of enforcement cannot be objectionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The fourth qualification is that, quite obviously, the court may deviate from the terms of the award if there is a statutory basis for doing so. There is at present no such statutory basis in s 19 or elsewhere in the Act (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the express power conferred upon the English courts by s 67(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the English Act to vary an award when disposing of a challenge as to the tribunal’s substantive jurisdiction).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 These four qualifications must obviously be kept within narrow confines lest they undermine party autonomy and go beyond minimal curial intervention. Furthermore, a creditor will ordinarily be expected to explain why it did not seek the assistance of the tribunal itself to incorporate the terms of the desired deviation directly in the award, whether under Art 33 of the Model Law or in some other way. Subject to these points, however, I do not think that these narrow qualifications contradict the twin policy imperatives which mandate the mechanical approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the mechanical approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The pure mechanical approach applies to this case. The plaintiff, quite correctly, does not suggest that any of the four qualifications I have identified has any possible application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Applying the pure mechanical approach, the leave which has been granted to the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to enforce an award in favour <span class="font-italic">Hydralift</span> cannot stand. The tribunal did not intend to issue and did not issue the award in favour of the plaintiff. The leave which the plaintiff has secured goes beyond merely allowing it to enforce the award in the same manner as a judgment <span class="font-italic">to the same effect</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The result of applying the pure mechanical approach is that only Hydralift has standing to apply for leave under s 19 to enforce the award. It is not to the point that Hydralift cannot now make any such application (unless, of course, it is restored to the Norwegian companies register under the Norwegian equivalent of s 208 of our Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) or of ss 344(5), 344D(1) and 344F of our Companies Act). The mere fact that Hydralift has ceased to exist does not supply a power to deviate from the dispositive terms of the award when s 19 contains no such power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is of course true that the rights against the defendant which the award has created spring from the Contract and, in particular from the arbitration agreement in it. It may also be true that the effect of the 2004 mergers has somehow been to project forward in time such that they operated in 2007 (when the arbitration commenced) and 2019 (when the award was issued) to transfer to the plaintiff the contractual benefit of the award. But even that hypothetical prospective transfer cannot supply a power to the court to vary or deviate from the dispositive terms of the award when s 19 contains no such power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 If Hydralift had ceased to exist <span class="font-italic">after</span> the arbitration commenced in 2007, instead of before, the plaintiff could have plausibly made the following argument. By its award issued at the end of the arbitration, the tribunal intended to benefit Hydralift, the legal person whom the defendant had named as the respondent at the start of the arbitration. But that legal person had ceased to exist while the arbitration was going on. As a result, at the enforcement stage, the court should carry the tribunal’s manifest but miscarried intent through to the transferee of Hydralift’s contractual rights, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the plaintiff. That could warrant the enforcing court taking a slightly broader view of the tribunal’s intent and construing the use of Hydralift’s name in the award as pointing to the plaintiff, being the ultimate transferee of Hydralift’s contractual rights. On that basis, having regard to substance over form, it could be said that the plaintiff’s leave to enforce nevertheless comes within the strictures of s 19 of the Act. I say only that this argument would have been plausible, not that it would have succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 But on the facts of this case, the plaintiff cannot even begin to make this argument. Hydralift ceased to exist well before the defendant commenced the arbitration. This means that the tribunal’s objective intent, manifest in the award, did not miscarry. To grant leave to the plaintiff to enforce this award against the defendant would be to assume a power to enforce an award that the tribunal never intended to issue, had no reason to issue and did not in fact issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 This finding is sufficient in itself to set aside the plaintiff’s leave to enforce the award. In case I am wrong on this, however, I go on to consider the four remaining questions the defendant poses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Is the use of Hydralift’s name in the arbitration a misnomer? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The second question the defendant poses (see [19] above) is whether the defendant’s naming of Hydralift as the respondent in the arbitration was a mere misnomer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a mistake merely as to the name of the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proceedings commenced by or against a non-existent legal person are a nullity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The cases on misnomer follow a dismally familiar pattern. First, a party to an arbitration is misnamed. That could be because the party has changed its name and the arbitration is commenced using its former name (<span class="font-italic">Unisys International Services Ltd (formerly Sperry Rand Ltd) v Eastern Counties Newspapers Ltd and Eastern Counties Newspapers Group Ltd </span>[1991] 1 Lloyd's Rep 538 (“<span class="font-italic">Unisys</span>”)). Or it could be because the party transferred its rights under the contract to another legal person and ceased to exist (<span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg Liv Holding </span><span class="font-italic">AB v Manches and others</span> [2006] 1 WLR 2276 (“<span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Harper Versicherungs AG v Indemnity Marine Assurance Co Ltd and others </span>[2006] 2 All ER (Comm) 225 (“<span class="font-italic">Harper</span>”)). Or it could be because the party did not enter into the arbitration agreement under which the arbitration is commenced (<span class="font-italic">Internaut Shipping GmbH and another v Fercometal SARL </span>[2003] 2 All ER (Comm) 760 (“<span class="font-italic">Internaut</span>”)). Next, depending on where incentives lie, the claimant (<span class="font-italic">Unisys</span>;<span class="font-italic"> Harper</span>;<span class="font-italic"> Internaut</span>) or the respondent (<span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>) claims that the misnaming is merely a misnomer, while the opposing party argues that it is fatal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The analysis which follows raises multiple metaphysical issues. Among them are three. What does it mean to speak of “a non-existent legal person”? What does it mean to speak of an act being done by or to “a non-existent legal person”? And how can “a non-existent legal person” be a party to an arbitration? I gloss over these issues by using the phrase “non-existent legal person” to mean simply “a name which does not point to a legal person at the time the name is used”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is common ground that, where an arbitration is commenced by a non-existent legal person, the arbitration is a nullity unless the use of the name can be characterised as a misnomer.

I do not detect in <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">EB Trygg (CA)</span> any intent to draw a distinction between these two categories. The lack of any such distinction is also consistent with authority, including the first instance decision from which <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span> arose (<span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg Holding Aktiebolag v Manches and others </span>[2005] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 129<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (HC)</span>” at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Finally, I consider to be artificial any attempt to draw a distinction between the foundation and the target of legal proceedings. It is axiomatic that all proceedings must be brought by a legal person against a legal person. It is only if both of those conditions are satisfied that the proceedings are in truth proceedings. A name recognised by law under which one can both sue and be sued is one of the defining features of legal personality (see s 24(2) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed), s 19(5) of the Companies Act and s 2(2) of the Minister for Finance (Incorporation) Act (Cap 183, 2014 Rev Ed)). <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic">oth</span> of these conditions must be satisfied for proceedings to be, in truth, proceedings. If it were otherwise, the concept of legal personality would lose one of its defining and distinguishing features. That is even more true when the proceedings in question are arbitration rather than litigation. Only a legal person can be party and counterparty to an arbitration agreement. Therefore, only a legal person can assert a right to arbitrate and be subject to an obligation to arbitrate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The plaintiff submits that the arbitration is not a nullity because the use of Hydralift’s name to describe the respondent in the arbitration was a mere misnomer for the plaintiff.

A finding of misnomer is not sufficient in itself to save an arbitration by or against a non-existent legal person from being a nullity. A finding of misnomer saves the arbitration only if the misnomer is corrected within the arbitration itself.

</div> In this case, even if the use of Hydralift’s name for the respondent was a misnomer for the plaintiff, the plaintiff made no attempt whatsoever to have the tribunal correct the misnomer before it delivered its award.

It contradicts the mechanical approach to enforcement and the twin policies underlying that approach which I have analysed above (at [37]–[50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Nevertheless, I analyse the plaintiff’s submissions on misnomer in the terms in which they are made.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>, four corporate vendors sold shares to a purchaser. One of the vendors: (a) transferred to a subsidiary the beneficial interest in its rights under the contract of sale; (b) merged with its parent, thereby transferring to the parent its obligations under the contract and the bare right to sue on the contract; and (c) ceased to exist (at [5]–[6] and [8]). All four vendors commenced an arbitration against the purchaser (at [2]). The purchaser brought a counterclaim against the four vendors. When the purchaser discovered that one of the vendors had ceased to exist even before commencing the arbitration, it sought a declaration from the court that the tribunal had jurisdiction over the parent, and that the parent would be bound by any award on the counterclaim against the non-existent vendor (at [12]). The parent argued in response that it had never been a party to the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The English Court of Appeal held that naming the non-existent vendor was a mere misnomer. It found that the purchaser, as the respondent in the arbitration, would reasonably have understood that the intended claimants were the four holders of the vendors’ rights under the contract and no other persons. Therefore, naming the non-existent vendor as a claimant was a mere misnomer for the parent, being the transferee of the non-existent vendor’s bare right to sue on the contract. This meant that the arbitration was not a nullity in so far as it involved a claim by and against the non-existent vendor (at [51]–[52] and [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 … We prefer to state the question as one of principle, namely, <span class="font-italic">who would reasonably have been understood by the party against whom the claim was asserted to be the entity bringing the claim?</span> Within the misnomer cases, that approach is that of Lloyd LJ in <span class="font-italic">The Sardinia Sulcis </span>[1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 201 …. In our case, the proceedings were commenced on the instructions of [the vendors’ agent], acting on the authority of [a director]. But what was the nature of that authority?

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my view, the plaintiff’s formulation is not supported by the authority of <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>. In any event, it is also my view that the test as framed at [51] of <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span> turns on the facts of that case and is not capable of universal application. For the reasons which follow, I consider the defendant’s formulation of the test to be more accurate, to be closer to the authority of <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span> and also to be capable of universal application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Every time a party is misnamed in an arbitration, there are two roles on offer: (a) there is the person who introduces the mistaken name into the arbitration; and (b) there is the person who is in a better position (as between the parties) to detect and correct the mistaken name. I use the word “person” here rather than “party” because the subject of the inquiry must extend beyond the party formally misnamed in the foundational documents of the arbitration to the person who instructs agents such as solicitors to do acts on behalf of the misnamed party in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 With those two roles in mind, I make two points about <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 First, both roles in <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span> were played by the same person: the parent. Not only that, but the parent was also the person arguing that its own misnaming of one of the vendors rendered the arbitration a nullity, at least in part. It is exceedingly unattractive for a person to argue that a name which it has mistakenly introduced into an arbitration – being a mistake which it was and is in the better position to detect and correct – renders the arbitration in part a nullity. The English Court of Appeal identified this as one of the singular features of <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span> (at [50]). That is perhaps one reason why this decision represents the high-water mark of the misnomer cases. It is not unreasonable to think that the analysis, and perhaps even the outcome, could well have been different if it had been the purchaser, rather than the parent, who argued that the arbitration was a nullity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The second point I make about <span class="font-italic">Seb Trygg (CA)</span> is that the court framed the test solely from the perspective of the party opposite the misnamed party because that was a case in which one person – the parent – played both of the roles I have identified at [77] above. In that sense, there was in <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>, one party (the parent) who bore all of the notional responsibility for misnaming and another party (the respondent) who bore none of that responsibility. It was therefore entirely correct and understandable for the court to frame and apply the test <span class="font-italic">only</span> from the perspective of the party opposite the misnamed party. But the same person will not always play both roles. The present case is an example. Like <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>, it was the defendant (as the claimant in the arbitration) who mistakenly introduced Hydralift’s name. But unlike <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>, it was the plaintiff (as the party instructing solicitors to participate in the arbitration in the name of Hydralift) who was in the better position to detect and correct the mistaken name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my view, therefore, it is wrong in principle to attempt to identify a misnomer in a situation such as this where the roles are split by looking at the misnaming solely from the perspective of the party opposite the misnamed person. This approach would result in an incomplete analysis of whether the case is indeed one of misnomer. In a case where the roles are split, the test must consider both parties’ perspectives: to whom did each party intend to refer when it used the non-existent legal person’s name in the arbitration? This is, in essence, the defendant’s formulation of the test (see [70] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There are two other conceptual reasons for rejecting the plaintiff’s formulation of the test. First, the plaintiff’s formulation incorporates an external reference point against which the intent of the party opposite the misnamed party is to be assessed. That external reference point is the concept of the “correct” legal person to participate in the arbitration. It appears to me that assessing intent against an external reference point in this way amounts to rigging the test in favour of a finding of misnomer. Conceptually, whether there is or is not a misnomer should turn only on the parties’ intent. I therefore consider the defendant’s formulation, confined as it is to an assessment of each party’s intent, to be preferable. Second, the plaintiff’s test is capable of yielding different answers over time. The “correct” legal person to participate in an arbitration can change, as a result of assignment or by transmission through mergers. This can happen even after the arbitration is well under way. It appears to me to be wrong conceptually to use a dynamic test such as the plaintiff’s to identify a misnomer. In any given arbitration, there is either a misnomer or there is no misnomer. The defendant’s formulation of the test is static, as it should be. It turns on the parties’ intent taken as a whole, assessed from the time the misnamed party is introduced into the arbitration. It can yield only one, unchanging answer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In terms of applying the test for misnomer, it is common ground that the test turns on objective intent and not subjective intent.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA)</span>, the court drew a distinction between litigation and arbitration for this purpose. As the court put it (at [50]), litigation is governed by statute (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the rules of court) whereas arbitration is governed by contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the parties’ arbitration agreement). Whatever may be the position in litigation, therefore, the usual objective contractual approach applies to the intent necessary to identify a misnomer in an arbitration. That is why the court (at [51]) framed the test objectively, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> in terms of reasonableness. That is also why the court (at [52] and [54]) applied the test objectively, by examining the subject-matter of the arbitration and by scrutinising the pleadings (see the italicised passages cited at [74] above).The test thus turns in the usual contractual way on what the parties said or did, not on what they thought, believed or intended without manifesting it. Relevant evidence of objective intent therefore includes the notice of arbitration and the pleadings (<span class="font-italic">Unisys </span>at 550 and 560; <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (CA) </span>at [52]). Uncommunicated (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, subjective) intent is not relevant (<span class="font-italic">Unisys </span>at 560).

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Incorporating objective intent into the test for misnomer, it can be formulated as follows: to whom did each party objectively intend to refer when it used the misnamed party’s name in the arbitration? Because the test is both bilateral and objective, it can also be reformulated without changing its meaning as follows: to whom did each party reasonably understand the other party to be referring when it used the non-existent legal person’s name in the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In applying this test from a given party’s perspective, it is legitimate to take into account that party’s knowledge or ignorance of the material facts, provided that its knowledge or ignorance was manifest. This does not amount to turning an objective test into a subjective test. The test still considers the question of intent in objective terms: solely from each party’s outward manifestations of its intent and how those outward manifestations would have been reasonably understood. But it is meaningless to assess how those outward manifestations would have been understood in a vacuum. They can only be reasonably understood in light of that party’s state of manifest knowledge or ignorance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I now apply this test to the facts of this case. I start by making findings about the parties’ manifest knowledge or ignorance of the material facts. I then apply the test from each party’s perspective.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ knowledge or ignorance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In this case, there are two facts which are material to applying the test for misnomer: (a) the fact that the 2004 mergers transferred Hydralift’s rights and obligations under the Contract to the plaintiff; and (b) the fact that Hydralift ceased to exist upon its merger with NOH taking effect. I make four findings about the parties’ knowledge or ignorance of these two material facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, and quite obviously, I find that the plaintiff knew both of these material facts at all times. The plaintiff does not allege any mistake or oversight on its own part about these two material facts. Indeed, it cannot credibly do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, I find that the plaintiff’s knowledge of these facts was manifest. Who better to know where Hydralift’s rights and obligations under the Contract resided in 2007 than the plaintiff? In the absence of any contemporaneous indication that the plaintiff was in doubt about either of these material facts, the plaintiff’s knowledge of these facts was manifest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Third, I accept the defendant’s evidence that it was ignorant of these material facts until the plaintiff attempted to enforce the award in 2019. The mere fact that the defendant used Hydralift’s name to refer to the respondent in the arbitration establishes this. The defendant had no incentive to do so if it had known either of these facts. Indeed, the defendant had a very strong disincentive against doing so. The defendant was the claimant in the arbitration. It was pursuing a claim against the respondent which was several multiples of the counterclaim (see [7] above). No reasonable claimant in these circumstances would have named Hydralift as the respondent – let alone incurred the time, cost and expense of pursuing the arbitration for 12 years – unless it was ignorant of these two facts. The plaintiff does not go so far as to suggest that the defendant had some ulterior or tactical purpose for using Hydralift’s name in the arbitration despite knowing these two facts. I am therefore satisfied that the defendant was ignorant of both of these facts until the plaintiff revealed them to the defendant in 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Fourth, I find that the defendant’s ignorance of these facts was manifest throughout the arbitration. That is established not only by the objective points which I have set out to support my third finding, but also by the plaintiff’s conduct on behalf of Hydralift in 2015 and 2016. That is when the defendant commenced litigation related to the arbitration against various members of the tribunal and Hydralift (see [125]–[126] below).

</div> As I find below (at [125]–[126]), the plaintiff actively concealed the merger and Hydralift’s dissolution from the defendant. The plaintiff would not have engaged in this extraordinary conduct if the defendant’s ignorance of these two facts was not manifest and if the plaintiff did not want the defendant to continue with the arbitration in its ignorance. In making this finding, I reject Mr Jensen’s evidence that the plaintiff “always thought that [the defendant] knew that [the plaintiff was] the successor company” of Hydralift.

Further, as far as the defendant knew: (a) the plaintiff was a stranger to the Contract; (b) the plaintiff was not the transferee of any of Hydralift’s rights or obligations arising under the Contract; and (c) the plaintiff was a holding company of Hydralift.

As I have already mentioned (at [90] above), the defendant had absolutely no incentive to commence the arbitration against any legal person other than the person it then believed to be liable on the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Third, the fact that the defendant chose to commence the arbitration using Hydralift’s name for the respondent despite these descriptions of Hydralift in this contemporaneous correspondence supports the defendant’s case, not the plaintiff’s. Names are treated with a relative degree of informality in correspondence, particularly between lay persons, and with a high degree of formality when commencing proceedings. The defendant’s conduct in naming Hydralift as the respondent despite Hydralift’s description in this contemporaneous correspondence suggests that the defendant made a conscious decision to reject any implication or inference arising from these descriptions and intended objectively to bring in Hydralift – and only Hydralift – as the respondent to the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The plaintiff even goes so far as to generalise its proposition and submit that <span class="font-italic">every</span> claimant in <span class="font-italic">every</span> arbitration objectively intends to name as the respondent to the arbitration whoever is the correct legal person then liable to the claimant on the underlying contract. I reject this submission. It puts the analysis at such a high level of abstraction that it renders any use of a name completely otiose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For this submission, the plaintiff relies on <span class="font-italic">Unisys, SEB Trygg (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis” and “Al Tawwab” </span>[1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 201 (“<span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span>”).

</div> Given that <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis” </span>is the case which most directly supports this submission, I focus my analysis on that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> a plaintiff had merged and ceased to exist under Italian law before an action was commenced in its name. The defendant argued that the action was a nullity and should be struck out, having been commenced by a non-existent legal person. The English Court of Appeal held that what had happened was a mere misnomer. The plaintiff was therefore granted leave to amend its own name to reflect the name of the legal person which continued in existence after the merger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Lloyd LJ (as he then was) framed the test in terms of whether there could have been any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intending to sue. The plaintiff adopts Lloyd LJ’s formulation and transposes it to apply to a respondent. The plaintiff’s submission is thus that the legal person “intended to be sued” in an arbitration is the legal person in whom the obligations under the contract in question are vested at the material time.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I do not accept the plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> for four reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 First, the plaintiff’s submission overlooks the conceptual difficulties with the test which Lloyd LJ himself acknowledged. Thus, Lloyd LJ expressly acknowledged that the concept of “the person intending to sue” or “the person intended to be sued” could be applied at such a high level of abstraction as to render it meaningless as a test for misnomer (at 207 RHC):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In one sense a plaintiff always intends to sue the person who is liable for the wrong which he has suffered. But the test cannot be as wide as that. Otherwise there could never be any doubt as to the person intended to be sued, and leave to amend would always be given. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 He therefore added a gloss to the test which assesses intent by looking at how the misnamed respondent has been described, not simply at whether the person is liable for the wrong. Thus, if the legal person intended to be sued is described in the proceedings in a way which is clear, an error in stating its name will be a mere misnomer (at 207 RHC):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if, in the case of an intended defendant, the plaintiff gets the right description but the wrong name, there is unlikely to be any doubt as to the identity of the person intended to be sued. But if he gets the wrong description, it will be otherwise. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Returning to the facts of the present case, there could be no reasonable doubt as to <span class="font-italic">the identity of the person intending to sue, namely, the person in whom the rights of ownership were vested at the date when the writ was issued</span>. … The description of the intending plaintiffs was clear enough. It follows that [the] mistake was a mistake as to name, and not a mistake as to identity. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By omitting all reference to the description of the misnamed party, the plaintiff is advocating and applying a test for misnomer for which <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> is not authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Second, on the test for which <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> is authority, the plaintiff fails. This is not a case where the defendant got the right description for the plaintiff but got its name wrong. All of the historical facts used to describe the respondent in the arbitration point only to Hydralift. None point to the plaintiff. It was Hydralift who entered into the Contract with the defendant. It was Hydralift who carried out the rectification work which was part of the subject matter of the arbitration. It was Hydralift who incurred the loss and expense which was also part of the subject matter of the arbitration. These descriptions are all matters of historical fact. The historical facts do not change when the rights and obligations under the Contract are transferred. These historical facts are incapable of describing the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Third, the test formulated in <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> is the test for the misnomer necessary to secure leave to amend the name of a party in <span class="font-italic">ongoing proceeding</span>s, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before the proceedings conclude and before the court becomes <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. That is precisely what the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> did. So too, in <span class="font-italic">Unisys </span>and <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg (HC)</span>, the party alleging misnomer took the issue to the court while the arbitration was ongoing and before the tribunal became <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>That is not the situation in this case. The plaintiff never applied during the arbitration – whether to the tribunal or (to the extent permissible) the court – to adjudicate upon the nature and effect of using Hydralift’s name for the respondent in the arbitration. Instead, the plaintiff permitted the tribunal to issue the award in favour of Hydralift and become <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The plaintiff complains that, following the award, the defendant refused to consent to the plaintiff taking the question of misnomer to the tribunal under Art 33 of the Model Law outside the 30-day window stipulated in that provision. But the defendant had no duty to consent. The real question is why the plaintiff did not raise this issue with the tribunal before the tribunal became <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> or, even after it had issued the award but before the plaintiff needed the defendant’s consent to refer the issue of misnomer to the tribunal. All of this, of course, assumes that a change of this nature comes within the limited scope of Art 33 of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Finally, <span class="font-italic">The “Sardinia Sulcis”</span> was decided under the English rules of court and not in the context of arbitration. As the court pointed out in <span class="font-italic">SEB Trygg</span>, the two types of proceedings raise different considerations (see [83] above). In particular, the proper approach in arbitration to an allegation of misnomer is a contractual approach, not a statutory approach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the defendant’s objective intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 For all of the foregoing reasons, I find that the defendant objectively intended its use of Hydralift’s name, and reasonably understood the plaintiff’s use of Hydralift’s name, to refer to Hydralift and not to the plaintiff throughout the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 From the defendant’s perspective, therefore, there was no misnomer. Indeed, the defendant’s mistake was neither a mistake as to the name of the respondent nor as to the identity of the respondent. The defendant’s only mistake was as to one of the attributes of its intended respondent, albeit a most fundamental attribute: whether it existed as a legal person. However, it is not the defendant’s mistake as to this attribute which is relevant to whether the arbitration is a nullity. What is relevant is whether the defendant objectively intended to commence the arbitration against a non-existent legal person. From the defendant’s perspective, I have found that that was indeed its objective intent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I now apply the test at [84] above from the plaintiff’s perspective.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s objective intent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 What I now have to determine, bearing in mind the plaintiff’s knowledge to the extent it was manifest, is this: to whom did the plaintiff objectively intend to refer when it used Hydralift’s name in the arbitration? I find that the plaintiff’s objective intent in using Hydralift’s name in the arbitration was also to refer to Hydralift and not to refer to the plaintiff. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 First, the plaintiff made no mistake of any sort in using Hydralift’s name in the arbitration. Quite unlike the defendant, the plaintiff knew both material facts (see [87] above). Despite this, it used Hydralift’s name in the arbitration rather than the plaintiff’s name. The only inference I can draw is that this was a deliberate and a conscious choice. The fact that the plaintiff was merely, at first at least, following the defendant’s lead does not detract from this inference. In these circumstances, the plaintiff’s objective intent in using Hydralift’s name can only have been to refer to Hydralift and not to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Second, the plaintiff’s own description of the respondent in its pleadings in the arbitration matches Hydralift, not the plaintiff. For example, the plaintiff’s defence and counterclaim describes the respondent in the arbitration as the legal person who carried out various rectification works on the subject matter of the Contract.

Our civil procedure requires the claimant to specify the unique identification number of the parties to the proceedings, to the extent that it can. In the four originating summonses which it filed in 2015 and 2016, the defendant left Hydralift’s unique identification number unspecified. The plaintiff’s affidavits, however, volunteered a unique identification number for Hydralift. The number the plaintiff chose to provide was not Hydralift’s historical identification number, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the registration number which had been assigned to Hydralift in the Norwegian companies register before it was struck off in 2004.

</div> The number was also not the plaintiff’s own identification number, on the basis that any use of Hydralift’s name after it had ceased to exist now pointed to the plaintiff. Instead, the identification number which the plaintiff chose to provide for Hydralift was the identification number of a completely different legal person: a legal person who was neither the plaintiff nor Hydralift and who was entirely unrelated to the Contract and to the dispute which arose from it.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Second, Mr Jensen’s explanation confirms the plaintiff’s desire to conceal the 2004 mergers and Hydralift’s striking off from the defendant and the tribunal in the arbitration; and from the defendant, the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the related litigation. That is the only conclusion I can draw from the plaintiff’s decision to provide the registration number of a company unrelated to the dispute which coincidentally bore the same name as Hydralift and the carefully chosen words “in order not to complicate matters” in the explanation which Mr Jensen now offers. A reasonable litigant in this situation would have readily “complicated” matters by disclosing the truth to the defendant, to the tribunal and to both courts. The truth was that the plaintiff could not provide Hydralift’s identification number because Hydralift did not exist. The plaintiff’s decision to provide the identification number of another company with the same name did not avoid complicating matters. It merely postponed the reckoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 For all these reasons, I find that the plaintiff’s objective intent in using Hydralift’s name in the arbitration was to refer to Hydralift and not to refer to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiff’s objective intent was therefore the same as the defendant’s (see [115] above). From both parties’ perspective, the use of Hydralift’s name in the arbitration was objectively intended to refer to no legal person other than Hydralift. I therefore reject the plaintiff’s submission that the parties’ use of Hydralift’s name in the arbitration was a misnomer for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In fact, as with the defendant, the plaintiff made neither a mistake as to name nor a mistake as to identity when it used Hydralift’s name to refer to the respondent in the arbitration.

</div> In that case, the English Court of Appeal had to determine whether one Mr Pharaon was the respondent in an arbitration. He had entered into a contract using his unincorporated trading name, “Al Ameen Development and Trade Establishment” (“the Establishment”) and its registration number. He later incorporated a company named “Al Ameen Development &amp; Trade Co” (“the Company”). But Mr Pharaon did not transfer his rights or obligations under his contract with the claimant to the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The claimant named the Establishment as the respondent in its notice of arbitration. But the claimant’s pleading defined the respondent as follows: “Al Ameen Development &amp; Trade Establishment (also known as Al Ameen Development &amp; Trade Co.) a limited liability company”. This was wrong in two respects: (a) it defined the Company’s name as a legal synonym for the Establishment; and (b) it averred that the Establishment was in fact an incorporated legal person. But the registration number given in this pleaded definition was the Establishment’s registration number (at [18]–[19]). Given that the claimant’s contractual counterparty was Mr Pharaon, the Court of Appeal treated the references to the Company in the pleaded definition as a mere mistake as to name and held that the Establishment was the respondent in the arbitration (at [67]–[69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The plaintiff argues by analogy that the fact that the documents in this arbitration repeatedly used Hydralift’s name for the respondent does not establish that the parties objectively intended Hydralift’s name to refer to Hydralift.

</div> That is undoubtedly so. The question which remains is whether this is a misnomer. But <span class="font-italic">Hussmann </span>does not assist the plaintiff in establishing that this was a misnomer. In <span class="font-italic">Hussman</span>, the claimant conflated two legal persons (Mr Hussman and the Company) into a single legal person and wrongly treated their separate names as legal synonyms pointing to the same legal person.

</div> That is a completely unnatural use of a name, whether as a matter of ordinary language, as a matter of law or as a matter of procedure. The natural use of a name even in – indeed, especially in – a foundational document in legal proceedings is to point to a legal person. A name cannot be stripped away from the legal person to whom it belongs and to whom it points and turned into a pointer to a pointer simply on the pretext of advancing substance over form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The plaintiff argues that names are less important in arbitration than in litigation because arbitration is consensual.

Second, the effect of cl 21.1 of the Contract (set out at [162] below) is to prohibit a transfer of Hydralift’s rights under the Contract upon a merger, including its rights under the arbitration agreement. Third, there is therefore no arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant to sustain the tribunal’s award against the defendant on the counterclaim. Finally, the award is therefore unenforceable (see Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law and <span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372 at [148]).

The interpretation of a contract must take into account the parties’ background.

There is, however, no reason to expect a non-Norwegian legal person, such as the defendant, contracting under Singapore law to do so, even if its contractual counterparty is a Norwegian legal person.

</div> Its submission is that, as a merger is a voluntary act, a transfer of rights upon a merger is a voluntary transfer and falls within the meaning of “assign” in cl 21.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In <span class="font-italic">Stansell</span>, the English Court of Appeal accepted that the word “assign” in an anti-assignment clause connoted “an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>disposition by one party in favour of another as an act of their joint volition” (at [64] and [66]). While I accept that <span class="font-italic">Stansell</span> is authority for the defendant’s submission, I have some difficulty with extending the word “assign” to cover a transfer of rights which takes place by operation of law upon a merger. No doubt that transfer of rights is the ultimate result of a voluntary act of the transferor and transferee in passing the resolutions and taking the other steps necessary to effect the merger. But it seems to me that the natural meaning of the verb “assign” requires these acts to be the direct cause of the transfer of rights and not merely an ultimate or indirect cause of the transfer. In other words, I consider that an assignment requires a voluntary act which, in itself, directly brings about the transfer of rights. That would exclude a transfer upon a merger. In a merger, it is the statute or a court order which operates in law to bring about the transfer of rights. The voluntary acts merely initiate the process and satisfy the conditions precedent for the statute or court order to operate to bring about the transfer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 This view of assignment is one which both the Court of Appeal and the judge at first instance rejected in <span class="font-italic">Stansell</span> (at [65]). This view finds some indirect support, however, in <span class="font-italic">JX Holdings</span>.

</div> <span class="font-italic">JX Holdings</span> establishes that a transfer of shares by operation of law upon a merger is different in legal character from a contractual transfer by the owner of the shares (at [18]). In that case, Edmund Leow JC held that the transfer of shares upon a merger is not a “transfer” within the meaning of s 130(1) of the Companies Act but is instead a “transmission” (at [43(d)]). In other words, the shares vest in the transferee not as a result of “a voluntary disposition of legal title to the shares brought about by an act of the shareholder” but as a result of “an automatic devolution of title which takes place by operation of law upon the occurrence of a legally significant event” (at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 This is also the position taken in a more recent English case decided in the specific context of both merger and arbitration on facts very similar to those before me. In <span class="font-italic">A v B </span>[2017] 1 WLR 2030, an Indian company (P) was the claimant in an arbitration against another company (E). In the course of the arbitration, P merged with another Indian company (F) by a scheme of amalgamation under Indian company law. The amalgamation resulted in: (a) F acquiring P’s entire business as a going concern by operation of Indian law and (b) P being dissolved and ceasing to exist (at [10]–[11]). The tribunal allowed F’s application to be substituted for P in the arbitration and rendered an award in favour of F against E. E applied to the English High Court to set aside the award on the basis that: (a) the transfer of P’s rights to F upon the merger operated in English law as an equitable assignment of those rights by P to F; (b) P failed to give notice of the equitable assignment to E before P’s dissolution; and (c) the arbitration had therefore become a nullity upon P’s dissolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Sir Jeremy Cooke held (at [44]) that there is a well-established distinction in English law between a transfer of rights upon a scheme of amalgamation and a transfer of rights upon an assignment. The distinction turns on whether the rights are transferred wholesale or only by a series of particular transfers. Only a transfer of the latter type is an assignment. Further, because the distinction between these two types of transfer is familiar to English law, the court should observe that distinction when considering transfers under foreign law, without getting bogged down in the technical question as to whether the transfers under the foreign law are considered a true universal succession in the civil law sense (at [45], italics added):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It would be wrong to classify [the transfer of the whole undertaking of P to F] by reference to that English law concept [of equitable assignment], particularly when the wholesale form of transfer <span class="font-italic">per universitatem</span> in an amalgamation or merger by statute or order of the court is familiar enough in [English law] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Following Sir Jeremy’s approach, the division between the experts on the meaning of “universal succession” or transfer “<span class="font-italic">per universitatem</span>” is immaterial.

</div>
</div>
</div> On the authority of <span class="font-italic">A v B</span>, I therefore hold that Singapore law does not consider a wholesale transfer of this type to be an assignment. As a result, Hydralift did not “assign” its rights under the Contract to the plaintiff via NOH simply by voluntarily initiating a merger which satisfied the conditions precedent for this wholesale transfer of rights by operation of Norwegian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 There are two other indicators that the Contract intended to draw a distinction between what is prohibited by cl 21 and what occurs upon a merger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 First, the subject matter of cl 21 is both “Assignment and Subcontracting”. Subcontracting assumes that the head contractor continues to exist after entering into the subcontract. That is consistent with “assign” being limited to a voluntary transfer following which the transferor continues to exist. That is not what happens under Norwegian law upon a merger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Second, it is of interpretive significance that cl 21.1 makes no reference to a transfer of Hydralift’s rights upon a reconstruction or amalgamation. As in <span class="font-italic">A v B</span> (at [18]), the Contract shows that, where the parties intended to provide for contractual consequences upon a reconstruction or amalgamation, they did so by expressly using those words. Thus, cl 13.1(c) of the Contract expressly provides that the defendant has no right to terminate the Contract on certain grounds if those grounds arise purely for the purpose of reconstruction or amalgamation. The omission of any similar reference to reconstruction or amalgamation in cl 21.1 indicates to me that that clause was not intended to prohibit a transfer of rights upon a merger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 For all of these reasons, I find that cl 21.1, on its proper construction under Singapore law, does not meet the “specific basis” requirement of Norwegian company law. As a result, cl 21.1 of the Contract does not prevent the 2004 mergers transferring Hydralift’s rights under the arbitration agreement to the plaintiff via NOH.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of cl 21.1 on the arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The result of my finding is that Hydralift’s rights under the Contract, and in particular its right to arbitrate a counterclaim arising from the Contract, are now vested in the plaintiff. But that does not assist the plaintiff in enforcing this award. This result means only that, if the defendant had commenced this arbitration against the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> in 2007, the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> would then have had a right to bring a counterclaim against the defendant and would now be entitled to enforce an award against the defendant on the counterclaim. It does not mean that the plaintiff was in substance the respondent to the arbitration or that the plaintiff is in substance the creditor under the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 I accept the defendant’s submission that, even if the plaintiff was the transferee of Hydralift’s rights under the arbitration agreement, it remains the case that the plaintiff cannot: (a) enforce an award which the tribunal intended to and did issue in favour of Hydralift; and (b) cannot enforce an award arising from an arbitration which was a nullity from the outset.

</div> These included: (a) the defendant’s position that the plaintiff had no standing to participate in the arbitration because it was not Hydralift and because Hydralift had ceased to exist in October 2004; and (b) the plaintiff’s response that it had the necessary standing because it had succeeded to all of Hydralift’s rights and obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I therefore find that the plaintiff did not fail to make full and frank disclosure on the first two matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 On the third matter, it was and is clearly incorrect for the plaintiff to describe itself in the title to this application as having been formerly known by Hydralift’s name (see [27] above). The plaintiff suggests, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Velstra Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Dexia Bank NV (formerly known as Artesia Banking Corp NV)</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 653, that this is the correct way to reflect the result of a merger in the title to proceedings.

</div> That case is no authority to that effect. In any event, whatever may have been done or not done in past cases, for whatever reasons, the assertion that one company was formerly known by a different name is a factual assertion. Whether the factual assertion is true or false turns on the facts, not on precedent. In this case, as I have pointed out, the plaintiff was never known at any time by Hydralift’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Nevertheless, Mr Jensen’s affidavit supporting the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application did disclose that the plaintiff and Hydralift were two different legal persons with two different names.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 I am therefore satisfied that the plaintiff discharged its duty to make full and frank disclosure of material facts even on this third matter. This is not a ground on which to set aside the plaintiff’s leave to enforce the award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The final result is that I have allowed the defendant’s application and set aside the plaintiff’s leave to enforce the award on three independent grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 First (see [35] above), the tribunal objectively intended to and did issue the award in favour of Hydralift, not the plaintiff. Under 19 of the Act, I have no power to allow the plaintiff to enforce an award which the tribunal did not intend to issue and did not issue in the plaintiff’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Second (see [115] and [133] above), both parties objectively intended to use Hydralift’s name in the arbitration to refer only to Hydralift and not to the plaintiff. Neither party therefore made any mistake as to Hydralift’s name or as to its identity. Hydralift having ceased to exist as a legal person long before the arbitration commenced, the arbitration was a nullity from the outset. The award is also a nullity and cannot be the subject of enforcement under s 19 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Third, the plaintiff is estopped by its representations in the arbitration and in the related litigation from denying that Hydralift was the respondent in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Costs follow the event. I have therefore ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant its costs of and incidental to this application, such costs fixed at $20,000. I have also ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant its reasonable disbursements, such disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I have allowed the defendant’s application with great reluctance. This arbitration took 12 long years. There was no impediment in the arbitration to the defendant presenting its case or to the plaintiff presenting Hydralift’s case. Therefore, the fact that Hydralift had ceased to exist before the arbitration was commenced does not, in itself, detract from the tribunal’s resolution of the parties’ dispute or from the procedure which it followed in doing so. That is no doubt why the defendant did not apply to set the award aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 My decision now to refuse enforcement sets to nought all of the time, money, effort and other resources which the parties and the tribunal have expended over 12 years. In addition, the limitation period for any fresh arbitration on the same claim and counterclaim has long since expired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Despite all these misgivings, the logic of the defendant’s case and the persuasiveness with which counsel for the defendant has presented it compels me to set aside the plaintiff’s leave to enforce the award. The only consolation is that the predicament in which the plaintiff finds itself now is entirely the result of its own extraordinary decision, sustained over 12 years, to impersonate Hydralift both in the arbitration and in the related litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">John Seow, Kelvin Poon, Aleksandar Georgiev and Kristin Ng (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wendy Lin, Goh Wei Wei and Ling Jia Yu (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
