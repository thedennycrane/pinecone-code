The Plaintiff highlights that in the present case, the Court did not direct for an affidavit of service to be filed with the request to enter judgment.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law applicable to setting-aside applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The legal principles relating to the setting aside of default judgments are well settled. These legal principles are set out in the seminal Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>, the Court of Appeal drew a clear distinction between default judgments which have been obtained regularly and those that have been obtained irregularly. As such, an important preliminary question is whether the default judgment sought to be set aside is regular or irregular.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The key principles that may be distilled from <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In assessing whether a regular default judgment should be set aside, the appropriate test was that laid down in <span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam </span>[1937] AC 473, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the defendant could establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defence in the sense of showing that there were triable or arguable issues: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [60];</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Notwithstanding the courts’ wide discretion to uphold or vary irregular default judgments, the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae </span>rule should continue to be the starting position in assessing an application to set aside an irregular default judgment, because litigants are expected to observe procedural rules. However, this starting position could be departed from if there were proper grounds for doing so. The key question for the court is whether there had been such an egregious breach of the rules of procedural justice to warrant setting aside the irregular default judgment as of right: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [74] – [76], [96];</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where an irregular default judgment was not set aside as of right, the court may nonetheless set it aside if there are merits in the defence. Should the court find that the defendant was “bound to lose” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Sir Staughton in <span class="font-italic">Faircharm</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Ltd v Citibank International plc </span>[1998] EWCA Civ 171 (“<span class="font-italic">Faircharm</span>”)) if the default judgment was set aside and the matter re-litigated, the court should ordinarily uphold the default judgment, subject to any variation which the court deemed fit to make and/or any terms which it deemed fit to impose:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [77], [91] – [93], [96] and [97];</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where the default judgment has been regularly<span class="font-italic"> </span>obtained, the legal burden rests on <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span> to show that its defence raises triable issues. In contrast, where it is alleged that the default judgment was irregularly<span class="font-italic"> </span>obtained, <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff</span> has the burden of persuading the court that the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae </span>rule should not be followed and if successful, the plaintiff has the additional burden of showing that the defendant is “bound to lose” in the event that the judgment in question is set aside and the matter re-litigated: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [98]; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The defendant’s delay in applying to set aside a default judgment – whether regular or irregular – was a relevant consideration and could be determinative where there had been undue delay. As a rule of thumb, the longer the delay, the more cogent the merits of the setting-aside application would have to be: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [30] – [36], [97].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In accordance with the framework espoused in <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>, the issues that arise sequentially for determination are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the Default Judgment is regular or irregular; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) if regular, has the Defendant raised any triable issue such that the Default Judgment ought to be set aside;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) if irregular, does the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae </span>rule apply such that the Default Judgment must be set aside as of right; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) if the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae </span>rule does not apply, whether the Defendant is bound to lose. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Default Judgment: regular or irregular?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 At first blush, the Defendant seems to have a somewhat compelling case.

Accordingly, an argument may be raised that the Plaintiff’s act of entering judgment against the Defendant <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Defendant had filed and served his D&amp;CC does not accord with O 19 r 2(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Furthermore and as stated at [14] above, the Plaintiff’s solicitors had on 9 September 2020 given the Defendant’s solicitors written notice of their intention to enter default judgment by <span class="font-italic">close of business </span>on 11 September 2020 pursuant to r 28 of the PCR.

</div>
</div> I shall now analyse each of the relevant authorities in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Gibbings</span><span class="font-italic"> v. Strong</span> (1884) 26 Ch.D. 66 (“<span class="font-italic">Gibbings</span>”), the defendant Strong gave Gibbings a charge upon costs due from another defendant, Burbidge, to Strong. Gibbings brought an action against both defendants, asking for an account and foreclosure against Strong, and that Burbidge be ordered to pay the amount of the bill of costs, £359, into Court. The time for serving the defence was extended from 1 August to 16 August 1882. No defence having been served, notice of motion of judgment was served on 18 November 1882. On 2 December 1882, Burbidge took out a summons for leave to serve a defence, which was dismissed on 6 December 1882. Burbidge’s defence was that there were other dealings between Burbidge and Strong, that no substantial part of the bill of costs was due, and moreover, that Burbidge was going to have the bill taxed. On 19 February 1883, the motion for judgment came on for hearing. The Court refused to look at the defence and gave judgment directing an account against Strong and ordering Burbidge to put the sum of £359 into Court. On appeal, the appellate court held that on a motion for judgment for want of defence, if a defence has been put in, though irregularly, the court will not disregard it, but will look at the merits of defence which, if proved, will be material, and if so, will deal with the case in such manner that justice can be done. The appellate court therefore ordered that the order for placing the £359 into Court be discharged, and an account directed of what was due from Burbidge from Strong in respect of the bill of costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The next authority is <span class="font-italic">Lady Elizabeth Anson (t/a Party Planners) v. Trump</span> [1998] 3 All ER 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Anson</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Anson</span>, the plaintiff, Lady Elizabeth Anson, commenced proceedings against the defendant, Mrs Ivana Trump, for breach of contract. The defendant was ordered to serve a defence within 21 days of service of the amended statement of claim, but she failed to comply with that order or to apply for an extension of time. The plaintiff’s solicitors indicated the date on which they intended to enter judgment in default of defence pursuant to O 19 r 2(1) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court (“UK RSC”) (which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 19 r 2(1) of our ROC). At 9.42am on that date, the defendant’s solicitors faxed a defence to the plaintiff’s solicitors, who had no knowledge of the fax, entered judgment in default of defence. On the defendant’s application to set aside the judgment, the deputy judge held <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that a judgment entered under O 19 r 2 of the UK RSC was regular where the defence was served outside the time limit provided by the rules or order of the court and that, in any event, under O 65 r 5(2B) of the UK RSC, the defence had not been served when judgment was entered. The deputy judge refused to exercise his discretion to set aside the judgment on the ground that the defence was unarguable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On appeal, Otton LJ referred to the commentary on O 19 r 2 of the UK RSC and the two 19th century decisions (one of which is <span class="font-italic">Gibbings</span>) to which reference was made. Otton LJ cautioned that those decisions should be considered in light of the then existing procedural rules, which were fundamentally different from the judicial process in place under O 19 r 2 of the UK RSC. He held that, consequently, little assistance may be gained from those earlier decisions. More importantly, Otton LJ held that the plaintiff had neither been blameworthy nor acted irregularly in entering judgment since she had no knowledge and could not reasonably have discovered that the defendant had purported to serve a defence; that a defence served out of time and without leave of the court, was served irregularly, and a judgment in default entered pursuant to O 19 r 2 of the UK RSC in those circumstances was regular, although it was liable to be set aside by the court as a matter of discretion. Crucially, Otton LJ agreed with the deputy judge that the reference to a defence under O 19 r 2(1) of the UK RSC must mean a regular defence and cannot include an irregular defence. The appeal was allowed in part as the English Court of Appeal found that the deputy judge had erred in concluding that the defence was unarguable, and leave was granted to defend part of the claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We turn next to the Malaysian High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span>. The Defendant cites the following passage from Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2014</span> vol 1 (LexisNexis, 2014) at p 804:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A judgment in default may be pre-empted by the service of a legitimate defence out of time but before the actual entry of the judgment. The court should take the defence into account, even if served beyond the period of validity; otherwise, the court’s time would be wasted by a subsequent application to set aside the judgment in default on the basis of merits in the defence. See <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span> <span class="font-italic">v BTC Clothier</span> [1996] 5 MLJ 45; … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The facts in <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span> are simple. The defence was filed out of time. The plaintiffs subsequently applied to enter judgment in default of defence. The defendants thereafter filed a defence and counterclaim, along with an application for an extension of time to file their defence. The plaintiff then took out an application to set aside the defence. The court allowed the defendants’ application for an extension of time to file their defence and held that insofar as procedural non-compliance is concerned, the court would always weigh the default as against the achievement of justice as a whole and that a defence delivered out of time must nevertheless be considered. It was further held that the courts in a case of this nature prefer that it be decided on merits and do not invoke procedural rules to prevent a defendant from defending an action <span class="font-italic">unless it has no merits in its application</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span>, the defendants showed that there was a real dispute as to the subject matter and the court held that it would be a waste of time to shut out the defence because if judgment in default was given, the defendants would apply to set it aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I pause here to make two brief observations. First, the term “legitimate defence” in the quote from <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2014</span> (at [54] above) refers to a meritorious defence as opposed to a procedurally regular defence. This is clear from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span>, coupled with the fact that there was no discussion therein on whether the defence was regular or irregular. Second, the facts in <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span> also show that whilst there was an application to enter judgment in default of defence, no default judgment had been obtained. As such, there was no discussion in the decision on the regularity of a default judgment to be entered. It is therefore difficult to see how <span class="font-italic">Metrojaya</span> would assist the Defendant in his submission that the Default Judgment is irregular.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Lastly, paragraph 19/2/2 of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>makes reference to a recent English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">MacDonald and another v D &amp; F Contracts Ltd</span> [2018] 1 WLR 5695 (“<span class="font-italic">MacDonald</span>”). In that case, the claimant property owners claimed against the defendant building contractor for damages arising from the defendant’s alleged repudiatory breach of a building contract entered into by the parties. The defence was filed out of time without leave. The plaintiff, unaware of the defence, applied to enter judgment in default of defence. The Court held that if a defence was filed out of time, an application for an extension of time to file the defence must be made in order for there to be a valid defence under the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (“UK CPR”). The Court went on to state that in that scenario, default judgment should be entered, and the onus is on the defendant to make the application to set aside the default judgment if he has grounds for doing so on the merits. Otherwise, the refusal to enter judgment in default because a defence has been filed would wrongly shift the procedural burden from the defaulting defendant to the plaintiff, to compel the plaintiff to apply for summary judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, although <span class="font-italic">MacDonald</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was decided based on the UK CPR, the above principles are equally applicable to the Singapore context. Our ROC allows for such an application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of the parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The crucial fact remains that the Defendant was out of time to file his defence. As alluded to above, the time limited for the Defendant to file and serve his defence fell on 7 September 2020 and he failed to do so. As at 9 September 2020, he still had not filed a defence which resulted in the Plaintiff’s solicitors issuing notice under r 28 of the PCR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Even though Default Judgment was entered on 11 September 2020 <span class="font-italic">at 4pm</span> which is just an hour before the stipulated deadline of close of business in the notice, I agree with the Plaintiff that, at law, the notice given under r 28 of the PCR does not extend time for filing a defence. Indeed, this is the position stated in paragraph 19/2/4 of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under r.28 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015, it is a matter of professional practice that before applying for a default judgment, at least 2 working days’ notice must be given to opposing counsel. <span class="font-italic">Failure to comply with this would not affect the application for judgment. The breach of etiquette would be dealt with professionally</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In addition, r 28(3) of the PCR provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To avoid doubt —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">this rule does not extend the time stipulated by an order of court, or by any provision of the Rules of Court, for taking any action or step</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) a legal practitioner need not give any notice under paragraph (1) before taking any action or step on a failure to comply with an order of court within the time stipulated by the order of court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is apt at this juncture to state that it is not for this court to decide if r 28(1) of the PCR was breached in the present case as that is ordinarily a matter for another forum: see <span class="font-italic">Karats Pte Ltd v Asia Capital and Brokerage Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGMC 20 at [21].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 What is pertinent to note is that the Defendant neither obtained leave to file the D&amp;CC out of time nor applied for an extension of time to file the D&amp;CC. O 18 r 2(1) of the ROC states that “[a] defendant who enters an appearance in, and intends to defend, an action must, <span class="font-italic">unless the Court gives leave to the contrary</span>, serve a defence on the plaintiff before the expiration of 14 days after the time limited for appearing …”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I accept the Plaintiff’s submissions that the consequence of the Defendant not obtaining leave, but proceeding <span class="font-italic">anyway </span>to file and serve the D&amp;CC is that the D&amp;CC was “<span class="font-italic">as good as not having been filed at all</span>”: see <span class="font-italic">Panwell</span><span class="font-italic"> Investments Pte Ltd v Lau Ee Theow </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 73 at [15]. It is incumbent on the Defendant to comply with the procedural rules. Where leave was not obtained to file the D&amp;CC out of time, the Plaintiff was entitled to proceed as if no defence had been filed at all, notwithstanding the Defendant’s purported service of the D&amp;CC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Applying the legal principles in <span class="font-italic">Anson</span> and <span class="font-italic">MacDonald</span> to the present facts, the D&amp;CC, being served out of time and without leave of court, was served irregularly, and the Default Judgment entered pursuant to O 19 r 2 was regular, although it is liable to be set aside by this court as a matter of discretion. It follows that the reference to “a defence” under O 19 r 2(1) of the ROC (see [47] above) must mean a regular defence and not an irregular defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one which has either been served within the time permitted by the ROC or in respect of which leave of court or an extension of time has been granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As regards the Defendant’s objection that the Plaintiff’s failure to file an affidavit of service upon entry of the Default Judgment constituted an irregularity, this objection should be viewed with reference to the applicable provisions, such as O 19 r 8A of the ROC and paragraph 76(4) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, both of which are reproduced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">O 19 r 8A of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entry of judgment (O. 19, r. 8A)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8A.

On 3rd July 2020, I met with the Plaintiff and updated him on the ongoinng (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) difficulties encountered by the Company. The Plaintiff insisted that I execute a document to acknowledge the debt owed by the Company to the Plaintiff pursuant to the [Funding Agreements] and included a revised payment schedule.

I wish to state that I was not given any opportunity to review the “Deed of Acknowledgment of Debt dated 03 July 2020” which was to be executed whether on my own or with any professional assistance, prior to signing the same. I believed that I was simply acknowledging the debt owed by the Company to the Plaintiff and I signed the Deed to reassure the Plaintiff that the Company would make all efforts to honour its commitment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26. I did not sign the Deed to personally undertake payment of the Company’s debts to the Plaintiff and am in no way liable for the Company’s debts. Further, I have no personal debts to the Plaintiff.

I would like to state that the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> should only be allowed in exceptional situations to rectify injustice and unfairness. It is fundamental that the sanctity of contract or agreement must be adhered to and respected. If the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> is allowed to be invoked liberally, then anyone who is not satisfied with the contract or agreement that he has entered into will easily renege on his contractual obligations by invoking the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>. This will lead to chaos and uncertainty to business and commerce …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53. It is, therefore, proper that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> must be a narrow one and is applicable only in very exceptional cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The requirements for the application of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> were laid out in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar bte Mohd Ali and others v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin</span> [2015] 5 SLR 62 at [119]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Non est factum</span> is a specific category of mistake that operates as an exception to the general rule that a person is bound by his signature on a contractual document even if he did not fully understand the terms of the document. If successfully invoked, the transaction entered into by the document so signed is void. Two requirements need to be established for this doctrine to apply … <span class="font-italic">First, there must be a radical difference between what was signed and what was thought to have been signed. Second, the party seeking to rely upon the doctrine must prove that he took care in signing the document, that is, he must not have been negligent</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Accordingly, in order to succeed on the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>, the Defendant must prove that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Deed which the Defendant signed was radically different from the document that the Defendant had thought he signed (“the First Requirement”); <span class="font-underline">and</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Defendant had exercised reasonable care and was not negligent when he signed the Deed (“the Second Requirement”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The First Requirement is easily disposed of. The Defendant needs to prove, or at least for the purposes of this Setting-aside Application, raise a triable issue that he was under a mistaken belief at the material time that he had signed a document to acknowledge the debt owed by the Company to the Plaintiff pursuant to the Funding Agreements. The clear terms of the Deed and the contemporaneous documentary evidence belie the Defendant’s assertion that he was labouring under any mistake when he signed the Deed. In fact, his conduct and the documentary evidence show an admission of liability on his part to the Plaintiff’s claim under the Deed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Terms of the Deed are clear and unequivocal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the terms of the Deed (see [8] above) are unequivocal.

I use the term “purports” because the said message only shows the introductory paragraph and paragraphs 1 and 2, with the “Read more” option at the end of the message. In any event, the Defendant did not state in his Reply Affidavit that the text of the Deed in the message was incomplete. All the Defendant could say in his Reply Affidavit was self-serving and that the Deed does not express any undertaking on his part to take on the Company’s liability. As we have seen, the text for the introductory paragraph and paragraphs 1 and 2 adequately show that the Defendant’s response is simply untrue.

It would appear that the Defendant only responded on 18 August 2020 after the Writ and the Statement of Claim were served personally on him on 17 August 2020. When the Defendant’s request to repay the debt by way of instalments was rejected on 19 August 2020, the Defendant replied by way of a further email on 20 August 2020 to the Plaintiff’s solicitors stating: “Please do advise what need to be added for the settlement.”

</div> Second, I am cognisant that the Defendant’s pleaded case (set out fully at [29] above) is that he was under a mistaken belief at the material time that the document he was signing was merely to record the Company’s acknowledgement of debt.

It is clear that the upshot of the pleading in [20] of the D&amp;CC relates to the defence of a lack of consideration and not so much the averment that the Defendant had assumed the Company’s liability to the Plaintiff. Further, [20] of the D&amp;CC must be read subject to the other parts of the D&amp;CC such as [5], where the Defendant avers that he is not indebted to the Plaintiff in any manner whatsoever. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Funds transferred from personal bank account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Plaintiff argues that out of the $240,000 received by the Plaintiff from the Company (see [6] above), $175,000 was transferred from the Defendant’s personal POSB bank account.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In my view, the Plaintiff’s submission is a neutral point, and at best, only goes to prove that the Plaintiff had a propensity to use his personal funds to pay for the Company’s debts. Further, the said payments were transferred from 3 April 2020 to 10 June 2020 and they pre-dated the Deed. Accordingly, this submission neither aids the Plaintiff’s case nor assists the Defendant in raising a triable issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged failure to explain how debt arose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For completeness, I shall now deal with the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff failed to explain that the debt arose out of the Funding Agreements with the Company and that the debtor is the Company. The Defendant also argues that the Deed does not explain how the Defendant became personally liable to the Plaintiff for the sum of $1,425,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my view, this is a red herring. The upshot is that the Defendant had signed on the Deed and has admitted liability for the debt on that document, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Defendant has recognised that this was a debt he was personally liable for. The Plaintiff, in this action, is suing the Defendant on that document, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Deed. The provenance of the debt is completely irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Delay and prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">First Property Holdings Pte Ltd v U </span><span class="font-italic">Myo Nyunt @ Michael Nyunt</span> [2020] SGHC 276 (“<span class="font-italic">First Property</span>”), the Court held that a defendant’s delay in applying to set aside a default judgment will be viewed differently depending on whether the default judgment is entered without a trial (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in default of appearance, pleadings or discovery) or after a trial in the defendant’s absence. The Court further held that in the former, if the defendant is able to show triable issues, the Court would be slow to refuse to set aside the judgment on the ground of delay (even if the delay is deliberate and contumelious) unless the delay was to gain some litigation advantage or the prejudice to the plaintiff outweighs the fact that there are triable issues. However, where the default judgment has been obtained after a trial, the Court would be most reluctant to set aside the judgment in the face of deliberate and contumelious delay unless there are very compelling countervailing factors. The dicta in [59] of <span class="font-italic">First Property </span>is instructive and reproduced as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 Where a defendant applies to set aside a default judgment entered without a trial: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the question of whether there is a defence on the merits is the dominant feature to be weighed against the applicant’s explanation for the default and any delay as well as against prejudice to the other party: <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Sh-Hsyu</span>”) at [42]–[43]; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the court will scrutinise the reasons for the delay; where the delay is deliberate, with the intent to gain some litigation advantage, a late application should <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be viewed uncharitably. Procedural rules must not occasion injustice by unfairly depriving a party of an opportunity to argue its case but the indolent cannot as a matter of course be awarded the same measure of justice as the diligent. The greater the delay, the more cogent the explanation must be as to why a miscarriage of justice would be occasioned if the default judgment were allowed to stand: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>”) at [32] and [35]–[36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 From the above legal principles, where a defendant applies to set aside a default judgment entered without a trial, the question of whether there is a defence on the merits is the <span class="font-italic">dominant</span> factor. In such a situation and going back to first principles, if the defendant is <span class="font-italic">unable</span> to show triable issues, the Court should <span class="font-italic">not </span>set aside the judgment. A court should uphold a default judgment where there is no meritorious defence as “it is in line with the goal of efficient case and resource management that the courts continuously strive towards”: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [87]. Ordinarily, the court may dismiss the setting-aside application on this ground (that there are no merits in the defence) alone. However, the court may, in my view, also take into account the defendant’s explanation for the default and delay as well as any prejudice to the other party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 First, the Defendant’s only explanation for the default, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the reason why the D&amp;CC was filed out of time, is because he “took some time to accumulate [his] supporting documents”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s 1st Affidavit at para 5.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This is not a satisfactory explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Second, as one will observe from the procedural history of this action, there has been delay on the Defendant’s part in bringing the Setting-aside Application. The said application was filed on 8 December 2020, more than 12 weeks after the Default Judgment was entered and after enforcement proceedings (a garnishee application and EJD proceedings) were taken out. The Defendant offered the following explanation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I had been on reservist on 2nd November to 7th November 2020 … As I was staying in camp, I had to go back to work thereafter in order to secure funds for the company and to meet all liabilities. It has been a difficult time because covid 19 (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) has shut down all our contracts. The company was also contemplating other lines of business including entering the provision of personal protection equipment for hospital staff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The reasons given above, simply put, do not justify the Defendant taking more than 12 weeks to file the Setting-aside Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The procedural history also shows that the Defendant was indolent in the conduct of his defence or in setting-aside the Default Judgment despite the reasonable opportunities or notice given by the Plaintiff. For instance, whilst it is true that the Defendant’s solicitors wrote to the Plaintiff’s solicitors confirming that the Defendant will be applying to set aside the Default Judgment, that occurred on <span class="font-italic">22 September 2020</span>. Prior to that, the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors by way of a letter dated 16 September 2020 requesting that either the Defendant makes payment of the judgment sum or provide a written confirmation by 23 September 2020, that the Defendant will be making the necessary application to set aside the Default Judgment within 14 days, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">by 30 September 2020</span>. I agree with the Plaintiff that it would not have been reasonable to wait indefinitely for the Defendant to apply to set aside the Default Judgement. I therefore find it reasonable that the Plaintiff waited for more than three weeks before filing the garnishee application on 8 October 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 On another occasion, the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors by way of a letter dated 9 November 2020 informing them of the EJD Order and asking whether they had instructions to accept personal service of the EJD Order on behalf of the Defendant. There was no reply to this letter thereby resulting in many attempts to effect personal service of the EJD Order on the Defendant. Much time and resources were wasted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I turn now to the issue of prejudice against the Plaintiff. Should the Default Judgment be set aside, quite apart from the significant time and costs incurred by the Plaintiff, I am mindful of the principle in <span class="font-italic">MacDonald</span> where the procedural burden is wrongly shifted from the defaulting defendant to the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiff in this action will be compelled to apply for summary judgment notwithstanding that the default lies with the Defendant. As such, I find that, if the Default Judgment is set aside, there will be undue prejudice to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I also find that there will inevitably be some prejudice or inconvenience caused to third parties such as the garnishee bank if the Default Judgment is set aside. The question that arises is whether the garnishee order and the EJD Order will be deemed as nullities. If so, does that mean the sums garnished ought to be returned to the Defendant’s DBS bank account? What about the impact on the garnishee bank that has acted on the garnishee order? All these questions could have been easily avoided had the Defendant simply not been dilatory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 For the above reasons, I find that the Defendant has not raised any <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>defences or triable issues to set aside the regular Default Judgment. All in all, I am of the view that no miscarriage of justice would arise if the Default Judgment is allowed to stand. My view is fortified by the Defendant’s explanation for the default and the delay as well as the prejudice to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remaining issues need not be considered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Given the findings in [69] and [114] above, it is not necessary for this Court to consider the issues pertaining to the application of the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">debito justitiae </span>rule and the test for setting aside an irregular default judgment.
