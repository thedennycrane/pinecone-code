During one of the plaintiff’s visits in late 2008 or early 2009 to the defendant’s house, the defendant asked the plaintiff whether the latter was interested in making money from foreign currency investments.  The plaintiff expressed her interest.  Over further discussions, it was agreed that the plaintiff would entrust the defendant with her funds and that the latter would invest them in foreign currencies.  The plaintiff transferred S$300,000 to the defendant in May 2009, and the defendant transferred that sum to a Dual Currency Investment account with CIMB bank (“DCI account”) which had been opened in their joint names.

The documentary evidence and the exchange of correspondence between the parties on the foreign currency investments were also limited.  Most of the evidence on this issue was based on the affidavit evidence and oral testimony of the plaintiff and defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span><span class="font-italic"> v Tan Choon Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”), the Court of Appeal recognised several important principles in relation to fiduciary duties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, “the hallmark of a fiduciary obligation is that the fiduciary is to act in the interests of another person”. In this regard, the “<span class="font-italic">distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty</span> … This core liability has several facets. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A fiduciary must act in good faith </span>… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> he may not act for his own benefit or the benefit of a third person </span><span class="font-italic">without the informed consent of his principal</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>…” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew </span>[1998] Ch 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Bristol</span>”) at 18, cited in Tan<span class="font-italic"> Yok Koon </span>at [192]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, a person “is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary” (<span class="font-italic">Bristol</span> at 18, cited in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [192]). In other words, whether a person is a fiduciary “is a <span class="font-italic">conclusion </span>which is reached only once it is determined that particular duties are owed” [emphasis in original] (James Edelman, “When do Fiduciary Duties Arise” (2010) 126 LQR 302 at 316, cited in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [193]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, “<span class="font-italic">fiduciary obligations are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">voluntarily</span><span class="font-italic"> undertaken</span> … the undertaking arises where the fiduciary <span class="font-italic">voluntarily places himself</span> <span class="font-italic">in a position</span> where the law can <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">objectively</span> impute an intention on his or her part to undertake those obligations” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [194]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hence, to determine whether the defendant was the plaintiff’s fiduciary with respect to the investments, the appropriate query is whether the defendant had voluntarily placed herself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention on her part to undertake fiduciary obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On my analysis of the evidence, it did not appear to me that the plaintiff was familiar with how the defendant had invested the money in foreign currencies, or what trades had been carried out by the defendant.  For example, in the emails they exchanged in July 2010, it was the plaintiff who was asking the defendant for information about the amounts that were due to her.

</div>  While this is not determinative, it provides some support for the plaintiff’s evidence that she was unfamiliar with the investments made, and she left it to the defendant to manage them.

This can be seen by the fact that the plaintiff had initially transferred S$300,000.00 to the defendant’s sole Standard Chartered Bank account, which indicates that she was simply entrusting her moneys to the defendant, and leaving her to decide how to place the moneys into the appropriate foreign currency investments.  Given the reliance that the plaintiff placed on the defendant, I find that the defendant had agreed to assume responsibility to act in the plaintiff’s interests as far as these foreign currency investments were concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For these reasons, I find that the defendant had voluntarily undertaken fiduciary duties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the plaintiff to act honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of the plaintiff, and to account to the plaintiff in relation to the use of her moneys for these foreign currency investments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claim arising from the Northvale property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for the plaintiff’s investment in relation to the Northvale property, the position is far clearer.

</div>  I also find that there was really no satisfactory explanation by the defendant or Eunice as to why the plaintiff was not reflected as one of the registered owners of the property.  There was some suggestion that the plaintiff wanted to hide her ownership of the property from her husband at the time because she was undergoing divorce proceedings.  However, the plaintiff’s ex-husband gave evidence that he was fully aware of her investment in the Northvale property at the material time.

What makes her evidence particularly hard to accept is that, throughout this entire period of almost ten years of funding the plaintiff’s trading and despite the significant losses, there is no evidence in the form of any email, text message, letter or any written communication which shows that the plaintiff ever asked her to fund the IG Asia accounts, or that the defendant had informed the plaintiff that she was going to transfer funds to the accounts pursuant to a request.  There is not even any documentary evidence to show that the plaintiff and defendant had ever communicated about trading in the IG Asia accounts or about transfers of funds to those accounts.  In other words, the defendant’s case in this regard is based entirely on alleged <span class="font-italic">oral</span> discussions with the plaintiff over the years.  I find this state of affairs to be most unusual, if it were true, in view of the number of transfers and the large sums involved.

</div>  Second, she accepted that she and the plaintiff were discussing the return of the amount of US$313,827.30 that was due to the plaintiff.  Third, she insisted that she was only offering to return the amount of US$313,827.30 if the plaintiff paid her back the equivalent in Singapore dollars, that is, approximately S$450,000, based on the exchange rate prevailing at that time.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On this third point, I do not accept that the defendant was telling the truth.  This can be seen from her last response sent on 3 October 2013 that is quoted above.  That made it clear that, when she was referring to the plaintiff having to return her Singapore dollars, she was actually referring to an issue that had arisen about two years earlier in 2011.  In August 2011, the defendant had sent an email to the plaintiff to inform her that CIMB Bank had in 2009 wrongly debited S$100,000 from her savings account, instead of the plaintiff’s savings account, when she asked for a conversion to US dollars from the foreign currency investments.

</div>  As a result, US$69,832.40 was being held by the defendant for the plaintiff, in respect of which the defendant expected the plaintiff to repay her S$100,000, the Singapore dollar equivalent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This issue was then resolved when the two of them agreed that the defendant would keep the US$69,832.00, thus reducing the amount that was owed to the plaintiff from US$383,659.70 to US$313,827.30.  This can be seen from the difference in the figures set out by the defendant in her emails to the plaintiff as being owed to the latter in 2010 as compared to in 2011.

It is possible that the defendant might have forgotten at that time that the issue had been resolved.  Or, she might have been trying to obfuscate.  Whatever might be the case, I am satisfied that the SMS messages sent by her constitute a clear admission of the debt of US$313,827.30 owed to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The following SMS exchange on 3 January 2014 between the plaintiff and defendant only serves to confirm my conclusion:

I do not accept the defendant’s explanations about sisterly love, support and restraint because it is quite clear from the tone of the messages that the relationship between the two of them was quite strained at that time and, in fact, got progressively worse.

As already mentioned, from October 2008 to July 2016, the defendant sent regular emails to her two sisters to inform them about the net rental proceeds.  In many of these emails, when she calculated the net amounts she would pay to the plaintiff and/or Eunice, the defendant would make very precise deductions of relatively small amounts that she had paid on behalf of her sisters.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For example, in an email in September 2012, the defendant informed the plaintiff that she had transferred the sum of S$988.73 to the plaintiff as her share of the Northvale property net rental proceeds for May to August 2012.

</div>  Trading on margin involves the investor paying for only a percentage of the security or asset, while borrowing the remainder from the bank.  The bank acts as a lender and the securities and/or assets which remain in the investor’s account act as collateral for the bank’s loan.  As the value of these securities and/or assets fall, the investor may be required to top up the account to a minimum level before further trades may be conducted.  In so doing, risk to the bank is minimised.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In my judgment, the plaintiff did not come across as someone who was sophisticated or knowledgeable about margin trading.  Her evidence was that she was not experienced in investing and was not a risk-taker.

</div>  Between the two of them, the defendant quite clearly dominated when it came to questions of trading and investments.  The defendant also struck me as being an extremely clever individual, who was always ready with a glib answer for any question that was asked of her in cross-examination, as one can see from the examples I have cited above.  There is little difficulty to conclude that between the two of them, the plaintiff was the more credible witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For the above reasons, I have no hesitation in rejecting the defendant’s evidence about the set-off agreement with the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does a proprietary estoppel arise to extinguish the plaintiff’s 25% share of the Northvale property?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102  To recapitulate, the defendant’s case in this regard is that the plaintiff made oral representations to her that she could appropriate the plaintiff’s 25% interest in the Northvale property if the plaintiff could not pay her what was owed arising from the funding agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Given my findings above that there were no funding or set-off agreements to which the parties had agreed, there is no basis for this claim of proprietary estoppel.  In short, I do not accept that the plaintiff had made the representation to the defendant as alleged.  In any event, I have my doubts that the doctrine of proprietary estoppel could apply on the facts as asserted by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> those facts were established.

The plaintiff denies this.  She also argues, in any event, that the defendant has admitted her claims so there is no issue of time bar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claims in relation to the sum of US$313,827.30 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The defendant relies on ss 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or 6(7) of the Limitation Act to argue that the plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract and fiduciary duties are time-barred.  These provisions are set out as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6.—(1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) actions founded on a contract or on tort; … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(7) Subject to sections 22 and 32, this section shall apply to all claims for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction or for other equitable relief whether the same be founded upon any contract or tort or upon any trust or other ground in equity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s causes of action accrued in or around December 2009 when the defendant transferred the proceeds from the foreign currency investments from the DCI account, which was a joint account, to her personal account in CIMB Bank.  Since this suit was only commenced on 21 November 2017, after the six-year limitation period, the plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I am unable to agree with the defendant’s argument as to when the plaintiff’s causes of action for the recovery of the US$313,827.30 accrued.  On my analysis of the evidence of both parties, I find that the positions of the plaintiff and defendant in relation to this US dollar amount are actually more nuanced.  It is true that the parties had agreed that the defendant would invest the plaintiff’s money in foreign currency investments with CIMB Bank, and return the proceeds to the defendant when the investments matured.  It is also true that the defendant, for reasons best known to herself, deposited the proceeds from the maturity of the investments into her personal account with CIMB Bank, without first seeking the plaintiff’s consent, sometime in or around December 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, when the plaintiff first discovered that this had happened, she did not immediately demand the return of her money.  Instead, after the defendant explained to the plaintiff that the money had been converted to US dollars and placed in fixed deposits that were rolled over periodically, the plaintiff appeared content to leave the money with the defendant for the time being.

In my view, the requirement of the SMS messages being “signed” is fulfilled by how the SMS messages were sent by the defendant from her mobile phone and the fact that the defendant’s name was appended in front of each message, the plaintiff evidently having saved the defendant’s number in her phone under “Diana”.  That this was how the messages would appear to the plaintiff was obviously something the defendant knew.  This suffices to indicate the defendant’s objective approval of the contents of the SMS messages, <span class="font-italic">which she does not dispute in any case</span>.  I draw support from the Malaysian Federal Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Yam Kong Seng &amp; Anor v Yee Weng Kai</span> [2014] 4 MLJ 478, where the same view was taken by the court in deciding that SMS messages were “signed” acknowledgements in the context of an <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> statutory provision on limitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Quite apart from the acknowledgement of the debt of US$313,827.30 via the SMS messages, a review of the defence and counterclaim filed by the defendant also shows quite clearly that there is really no arguable issue of time-bar.  In her defence and counterclaim, as I have already explained at [22] to [26] above, the defendant does not deny that she owed the sum of US$313,827.30 to the plaintiff.  The thrust of her defence is that this sum had been set-off against what was owed by the plaintiff to the defendant arising from the funding and set-off arrangements.

</div>  I am of the view that this pleading itself was an acknowledgment of the debt owed by the defendant,  notwithstanding how the defendant does go on to plead that the debt had been extinguished by reason of a set-off.  That a pleading may contain an acknowledgment of a claim for the purposes of re-setting the time bar is not controversial.  An example was in the case of <span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 565 (“<span class="font-italic">Murakami</span>”), where the Court of Appeal found that an earlier version of a statement of claim, which had then been amended, had acknowledged the defendant’s claim to an interest in certain real property in Singapore.  The effect was that the defendant’s counterclaim was accordingly not time-barred: <span class="font-italic">Murakami </span>at [39]–[40].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 For the above reasons, I am unable to accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff’s causes of action are time-barred under ss 6(1) and 6(7) of the Limitation Act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 But that is not the end of the inquiry.  I have found at [37] to [45] above that the defendant had assumed fiduciary duties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the plaintiff insofar as the proceeds from the foreign currency investments were concerned, that is, the sum of US$313,827.30.  In breach of her fiduciary duty, the defendant failed to account for this sum by not returning the said sum to the plaintiff when there was a demand for this to be done.  In such a case, a constructive trust arises by operation of law, as the circumstances in which the defendant came into ownership of the sum of US$313,827.30 make it unconscionable for her to assert her own beneficial interest and to deny the beneficial interest of the defendant in the sum: <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance</span><span class="font-italic"> plc v D B Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm) </span>[1999] 1 All ER 400 (“<span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 409.

Hence, for s 22 of the Limitation Act to even apply, it must first be determined that the defendant holds the sum of US$313,827.30 as a Class 1 constructive trustee.  The distinction between the two classes were explained by Millett LJ in <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance </span>at 409<span class="font-italic"> </span>(cited in <span class="font-italic">Panweld </span>at [45]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the first class of case … the constructive trustee really is a trustee.

It arises when the defendant is implicated in a fraud. Equity has always given relief against fraud by making any person sufficiently implicated in the fraud accountable in equity. In such a case he is traditionally though I think unfortunately described as a constructive trustee and said to be ‘liable to account as constructive trustee’. Such a person is not in fact a trustee at all, even though he may be liable to account as if he were. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The distinction between the two classes of constructive trustees was applied to the facts of <span class="font-italic">Panweld.  </span>In that case, a company director paid his wife salary out of the company’s assets for over 17 years even though she was never an employee of the company.  In the circumstances, the court held that he was a Class 1 constructive trustee.  This was because “[h]e was, by virtue of his directorship, lawfully able to deal with [the company’s] assets, albeit in accordance with his fiduciary duties” as a director (<span class="font-italic">Panweld </span>at [48]).  By thereafter unlawfully disposing of the company’s assets to his wife, he was in breach of the trust and confidence placed in him as a director, and he fell squarely within the description of a Class 1 constructive trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Similarly, in the present case, the plaintiff entrusted her moneys with the defendant for the purposes of the foreign currency investments, and the resulting proceeds was the sum of US$313,827.30.  In breach of her fiduciary duties in respect of that sum, the defendant refused to return the sum to the plaintiff when the plaintiff so requested.  The defendant is accordingly a Class 1 constructive trustee, and s 22 of the Limitation Act therefore applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Applying s 22 of the Limitation Act, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant is a constructive trustee for the sum of US$313,827.30 will be time-barred unless she is able to establish fraud or a fraudulent breach of trust, or that the defendant has converted the trust property to her own use, or is still in possession of the trust property.  In my judgment, since it is the defendant’s own evidence that she had regarded the sum of US$313,827.30 as the plaintiff’s contribution to the funding arrangement which I have found to be concocted (at [90]), the sum clearly has been converted to the defendant’s own use.  Hence, I find that no time bar arises in relation to this proprietary claim.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The claims in relation to the Northvale property </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For the Northvale property, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that she is a 25% owner of the property and for an order that the land-register be rectified to reflect her ownership.  The relief can be granted given my earlier finding at [48] that the defendant holds the plaintiff’s 25% interest in the property on a resulting trust.  No issue of time bar arises in this regard, as s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act prescribes an exception in cases where a beneficiary seeks recovery of trust property in the possession of the trustee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 However, the plaintiff also seeks an order that the defendant give an account of the expenses and rental proceeds arising from the Northvale property.  The defendant relies again on s 6(7) of the Limitation Act, which has been referred to above, to argue that the cause of action for an account is time-barred.  The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s cause of action for an account of rental proceeds accrued in or around October 2008.  That was when the defendant started providing statements of account for the expenses incurred and the rental proceeds earned from the Northvale property to the plaintiff.  The defendant argues that, if there were any shortfall in the rent due to her or any improper deductions, the plaintiff should have been aware of it by then and commenced any proceedings within six years.

</div>  Section 22(1) of the Limitation Act deals, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, with situations where there has been a fraud or a fraudulent breach of trust, or where there is an action to recover trust property from the trustee which has been converted by the trustee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The plaintiff submits that both s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would apply.  This is because there was a fraudulent breach of trust by the defendant in dishonestly overcharging the plaintiff for the upkeep of the Northvale property.  Also, by making unnecessary and inappropriate deductions from the gross rental proceeds, the defendant had converted a portion of the rental proceeds, which constitutes trust property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 While I agree that s 6(7) of the Limitation Act is relevant because, as pointed out by the defendant’s counsel, it refers to all claims for equitable relief, including the obligation to account to the beneficiary for income earned from trust property, I have some difficulty with the defendant’s submissions on this issue of time-bar.  In particular, I disagree with the defendant that the cause of action accrued from as early as 2008, when she started sending statements of account, and when the plaintiff was in a position to ask for an account if she felt that what was being provided was inadequate.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In this regard, s 6(2) of the Limitation Act states that “[a]n action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter which arose more than 6 years before the commencement of action”.  In <span class="font-italic">Ang Toon Teck v Ang Poon Sin</span> [1998] SGHC 67, it was held that a cause of action for an account arises when the accounting party has assets of the claimant in his hands for which he is liable to account, unless there is an agreement or other arrangement between them that the liability to account would only arise at a later time (at [67]–[68]).  Applying that principle, the defendant’s equitable obligation to account to the defendant for the rental proceeds would accrue from the time she received the rental income earned from the Northvale property.  Considered with s 6(2) of the Limitation Act, the defendant would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> only be liable to account for the rental received in the six years prior to the commencement of this suit.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As for the plaintiff’s reliance on s 22(1) of the Limitation Act, I find her arguments in that regard to be unsustainable.  In relation to s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), there is simply insufficient evidence before me to show that there was fraud on the part of the defendant in the manner in which she accounted for the expenses and net rental proceeds.  The evidence showed that there might be a difference of opinion as to what the defendant was entitled to deduct as expenses in computing the net rental proceeds, or that the defendant might inadvertently have made some errors in her deductions because she relied on estimates, for example, of property tax payable rather than the actual figures.  Such conduct does not amount to fraud.  Dishonesty must be established by the plaintiff, which has not been done.  As Vinodh Coomaraswamy J stated at [196] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah Leh v Heng Fock Lin</span> [2018] SGHC 156, when discussing the requirement of fraud: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The meaning of “fraud” and “fraudulent” for the purposes of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is well established. In <span class="font-italic">Armitage v Nurse and Others</span> [1998] Ch 241 at 260F (“<span class="font-italic">Armitage</span>”), Millett LJ held that for the purposes of s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the English Limitation Act 1980 (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of our Limitation Act),<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“fraud” requires dishonesty</span> and that dishonesty is defined as follows (at 251E–F): “[i]f [a trustee] acts in a way which he does not honestly believe is in the interests of the beneficiaries then he is acting dishonestly”. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As for s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act, I do not accept that it has been shown on the evidence that the defendant has converted a part of the rental income to her own use, or still retains possession of that portion of the rental income that should have been paid over.  It is alleged that the defendant made an over-deduction of expenses, for example, by deducting a sum as property tax which is higher than what was actually levied by the Comptroller,

</div>
</div> but it does not follow from this that the excess amount charged has been converted by the defendant or is still in the possession of the defendant.  This has not been established on the evidence.  Therefore, the exceptions in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) do not assist the plaintiff in overcoming the six-year limitation period for an action for an account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 On my analysis of the evidence and the parties’ respective positions, I find that the plaintiff’s real complaint is that she wants the defendant to continue giving an account of the rental proceeds from the Northvale property.  This was what the defendant was doing up to July 2016.  Throughout the period when accounts were furnished from October 2008 to July 2016, there was no evidence that the plaintiff had raised any complaint that the accounts were inaccurate or wrong, or that there had been any wrongful deductions from the gross rental proceeds.  It is only from July 2016 that the defendant stopped giving an account of the rental proceeds.  That was when the plaintiff raised her complaint.  Further, it was only then that the plaintiff looked carefully at the expenses that had been deducted over the years, giving rise to the allegations in these proceedings that the defendant had made improper deductions.  However, as per s 6(2) of the Limitation Act, she is limited to an account only for the six years prior to the date she commenced these proceedings given her inability to establish fraud, or that the wrongfully withheld rental proceeds are still in the possession of the defendant, or had been converted by the latter.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I thus find that the plaintiff is entitled to an account of the expenses and rental proceeds from the Northvale property from 21 November 2011, being six years before the commencement of this suit.  The expenses and outgoings in relation to the property must be shared between the three sisters in proportion to their ownership shares.  The same manner of division applies to the net rental proceeds.   After a proper and full account is given, the defendant must pay over to the plaintiff her share of the net rental proceeds, insofar as such payment has not already been made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Doctrine of laches inapplicable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133     For completeness, I find that the plaintiff’s causes of action are not barred by the doctrine of laches.  In <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng </span>[2016] 2 SLR 464 at [44], the Court of Appeal affirmed the following principles in <span class="font-italic">Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 at [46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Laches is a doctrine of equity.

</div>  Hence, the lack of documentary evidence with regard to the funding and set-off agreements is not caused by the lapse of time, as no documentary evidence in fact existed for those agreements.  Accordingly, it would not be practically unjust to give the plaintiff the remedies sought, in particular as her conduct cannot be regarded as having been equivalent to a waiver of her claims.  From as early as 2012, the plaintiff had repeatedly sent emails and SMS messages to the defendant, pestering her for the return of the US$313,827.30 and the proceeds thereof.
