</div> were in truth, attacks on the adjudicator’s decision rather than his decision-making process. These allegations ought to have been taken up in an adjudication review application under s 18 of the Act. They are not valid grounds for judicial review of the adjudicator’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 There could have been an argument that the adjudicator’s decision was tainted by extraneous (and therefore irrelevant) considerations such as concerns about the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of [DEF Contractor]’s contract with the plaintiff. But I saw nothing necessarily wrong with such an approach. Naturally, any adjudicator is vigilant about the possibility of fraudulent or sham contracts. The plaintiff’s complaint was that it did not have a chance to address the adjudicator’s doubts before these were memorialized in an adjudication determination. But an adjudicator is not under any obligation to test his reasoning with the claimants/respondents before him. He is not obliged to inform the parties of his thoughts during the adjudication conference and certainly not expected to zealously search for arguments that would persuade him to adopt a different position. His duties extend to reason giving, and that was amply done in the present case. The plaintiff’s real complaint therefore, was with the adjudicator’s <span class="font-italic">reasoning</span>. Again, these went to the merits of the adjudication determination and were therefore untenable in an application to set aside an adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 This left me with the two main issues for this application:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Whether a payment claim for works performed prior to termination of employment amounted to a patent error. (“The Termination Issue”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Whether the adjudicator acted in excess of jurisdiction in considering the bond proceeds in the adjudication.

In support of this, he cited s 5 of the Act which expressly provides that “[a]ny person who has carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or service, under a contract is entitled to a [progress payment]”. In the absence of any statutory or contractual bars, the fact that these payment claims were served two years after employment termination was inconsequential.

It pointed out that the REDAS Form of Contract envisions a certifier (the ER) certifying payment claims before any payment is given. The plaintiff claimed that the ER’s certification was a condition precedent to the contractor’s right to receive payment, a role that could be likened to the architect’s in an SIA Form of Contract.

</div> Though there was no explicit provision bringing the ER’s powers of certification to an end, the plaintiff claimed that when the ER’s employment was terminated, his powers of certification naturally came to an end. Any payment claim after that point would accordingly, be invalid since the certifying authority was now <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant, in reply, began by addressing the larger issue of whether a payment claim can be made for works prior to termination.  It argued that such payment claims are certainly valid, and cited two authorities in support of that proposition. First, parliamentary debates suggested that references to “contracts” under the Act have <span class="font-italic">always</span> included references to construction contracts that have been terminated.

</div> Accordingly, payment claims for works done prior to contract termination have always been valid. Though there was no explicit statutory language to that effect, the debates suggested that parliament had always intended that to be the case. Indeed, this has culminated in the most recent amendments to the Act which have since made that position explicit in unambiguous statutory language.

</div> This, the defendant argued, was the logical and uncontroversial crystallization of a long-held parliamentary intent. Second, the defendant pointed to existing case authorities that “speak with one voice in showing that a contractor who has performed works under a construction contract can continue to claim for such works even after its employment under the contract has been terminated […] because the contractor has an accrued statutory entitlement to payment, which necessarily survives the termination.”: <span class="font-italic">Stargood</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd v Shimizu Corp</span> [2019] SGHC 261 at [40] (“<span class="font-italic">Stargood</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendant then addressed the plaintiff’s submissions about <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>’s applicability to the present matter.

Although it is clear from the amounts set out in the payment claim that the bond proceeds were set off against the payments received by the defendant, the plaintiff argued that the defendant should have explicitly stated this fact in its payment claim – that is, the defendant should have mentioned it was taking the bond monies into account when it was calculating the amount that it had been paid to date.

Where an adjudicator makes an adjudication determination in favour of a claimant despite patent errors in the payment claim, the court will deem that the adjudicator had failed to recognise those errors and thereby had failed to comply with s 17(3) of the Act: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [79]–[84]. The question therefore, turns to: (a) whether a payment claim for works done prior to termination is invalid; and (b) whether a payment claim submitted after the termination of the ER’s employment is invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The authorities are unanimous in their support for the proposition that payment claims made for work done prior to termination of employment are perfectly valid. As a matter of policy, the statutory entitlement to payment must survive termination. The Act was designed to protect and facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry. Such legislative intent would be hobbled if employers could simply terminate their contracts and escape payment obligations under the Act: <span class="font-italic">Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Lim Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 364 at [17]-[18] and <span class="font-italic">Stargood</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction </span>at [21]. Indeed, a contractor’s cash flow concerns do not end upon termination of its employment. As Woo Bih Li J observed in <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kim and another v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Eng Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 1210 at [38], a contractor may have multiple concurrent projects and the liquidity injections from one project may very well go towards satisfying expenses for another. Termination of one contract does not mean termination of the need for cash flow altogether. The Act upholds that commercial need and the case law has accordingly, followed suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I turn to consider <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>, which stands for two propositions. First, payment claims under the SIA Form of Contract are invalid if they are submitted after the final certificate has been issued by the architect: <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [39]. Second, these sort of payment claims constitute a patent error, and are therefore grounds for an adjudicator’s determination to be set aside for breach of s  17(3) of the Act: <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [71] – [72].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>is distinguishable from the present case. Firstly, this matter involved a REDAS Form of Contract while <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>concerned an SIA Form of Contract. This distinction is crucial (see below at [28]). Secondly, the ER’s role in a REDAS Form of Contract is markedly different from the architect’s role in an SIA Form of Contract. The architect in an SIA Form of Contract “plays a fundamental role in the entire construction process” <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [32]. He is the administrator of the construction contract (<span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [33]) and “plays an integral role in the payment certification process” (<span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [34]). Indeed, he is the “quasi-adjudicator of both the contractor’s right to receive payment for work done as well as the employer’s right to withhold payment on account of any cross-claim”: <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>at [32] citing <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan v HP Construction and Engineering</span> [2015] 3 SLR 124 at [13]. The ER on the other hand, is neither an independent certifier nor a referee between the parties in any meaningful sense. He is the employer’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>representative and thereby an agent of the employer. His certifications are not an <span class="font-italic">objective assessment</span> of works done and monies due. They are instead, mere signals of the employer’s assent to the payment claim, as submitted by the contractor.  This makes them a categorically different kind of certification from that of the architect’s in an SIA Form of Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Thirdly, there are explicit provisions which mark the end of the architect’s duties under the contract and render him <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. The issuance of the Final Certificate (as provided for in cl 31(12)(a) of the SIA Conditions of Contract) brings his certification powers to an end (cl 37(3)(i) of the SIA Conditions of Contract). There is simply no analogous provision or series of events that renders the ER <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff was of course, keenly aware that the present matter was not on all fours with <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span>. It sought therefore, to apply <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>by analogy. Taking its case at its highest, <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>could be said to stand for a broader proposition. Namely, that in any contract where a certificate functions as a condition precedent to the contractor’s right to receive payment, payment claims would be invalid if made after the certifier was rendered <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>. I could not accept that <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>stood for such a broad proposition. For one, the Court of Appeal spent a considerable part of its judgment examining the structure, demands and procedure of the SIA Form of Contract (see <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [32] – [38]). This contextualised and demarcated the scope of its decision to specifically contracts drafted pursuant to the SIA Form of Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Moreover, such a generous reading of <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee </span>takes an excessively simplistic view of certificates as “condition precedents to payment”. In the SIA Form of Contract context, certificates which activate a contractor’s right to receive payment are more than just tickets for cash. They are the product of independent assessment and proper evaluation of the works done and monies owing between the parties. They are instruments of governance in a carefully constructed standard form which envisions that “all areas of possible financial controversy, except most cases of breach of contract by the Employer and all terminations of the Contract by either party” are to be regulated by the certificates of the Architect.” (<span class="font-italic">Guidance notes on Articles and Conditions of Building Contract </span>(Singapore Institute of Architects, 3rd Ed, 2011) at p 1). The ER in a REDAS Form of Contract does nothing of this sort. The ER’s certificates are no more than steps in a payment procedure, and hardly carry the same weight as a certificate issued by an architect who plays an “<span class="font-italic">integral role</span> […] in the <span class="font-italic">administration</span> of the SIA Form of Contact”: <span class="font-italic">Yau</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee</span> at [39] (emphasis added). And so naturally, once the architect becomes <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, the entire administration and payment process in an SIA Form of Contract must come to an end. The same cannot necessarily be said for an ER operating under the auspices of the REDAS Form of Contract. To simply argue that both the architect’s and ER’s certificates were “condition precedents” to payment and thereby analogous in some manner, is to forget the unique obligations of each role under its respective contractual scheme.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The Bond Issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The starting point was s 17(3)(c) of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">17.</span>—(3) Subject to subsection (4), in determining an adjudication application, an adjudicator shall only have regard to the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the payment claim to which the adjudication application relates, the adjudication application, and the accompanying documents thereto;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As stated earlier, the plaintiff’s complaint was that the payment claim submitted by the defendant should have <span class="font-italic">explicitly </span>made reference to the bond monies which were considered when calculating sums that had previously been paid to the defendant. On a plain reading of the provision, I could not find any support for that supposed legal requirement. If an item is included in the payment claim, then the adjudicator shall have regard to it. Here, there was no dispute between the parties that the bond monies were indeed included in the computation of the amount due in the payment claim. The question turns to whether <span class="font-italic">SH Design</span> established such a legal requirement – namely that for an item to be considered as part of the payment claim, it must always be <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> particularized and claimed. In support, the plaintiff quoted <span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>at [57]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, the Adjudicator had the jurisdiction to account for the Bond Proceeds because these were included in the Payment Response, notwithstanding that these were not <span class="font-italic">stated </span>in the Payment Claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This was a pedantically literal interpretation of the judgment. Tan Siong Thye J was not introducing a new legal requirement in that paragraph of <span class="font-italic">SH Design</span>. Paragraph [57] was merely a summary of the three sub-issues concerning the adjudicator’s jurisdiction. Tan J’s actual findings about an adjudicator’s obligation to consider bond monies were found in paragraphs [46] to [50]. In those paragraphs, there was no discussion of how <span class="font-italic">explicitly </span>a claimant had to state an item in its payment claim for it to be considered by the adjudicator. The real question there was simply whether “an adjudicator’s jurisdiction is framed by <span class="font-italic">both </span>the payment claim and payment response” (emphasis in original): <span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>at [48]. The closest statement that could have supported the plaintiff’s case was found in paragraph [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…] given that the applicant had not merely omitted the retention sum claim from its payment claim but went further to <span class="font-italic">expressly </span>exclude it from its payment claim[,] [t]his amounted to an unsolicited admissions from the applicant that the retention sum was not due</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 But even this did not bring the plaintiff’s arguments much further. If something were <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> <span class="font-italic">excluded</span> from a payment response or payment claim, the adjudicator would naturally be unable to consider it under s 17(3)(c) of the Act. But it does not follow that there is a corollary requirement to explicitly describe the component parts of an item in a payment claim, especially if it had already been explained in the accompanying adjudication application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Indeed, the provision allows adjudicators to have regard to not just the adjudication application itself (s 17(3)(c) of the Act, as reproduced above), but also the “submissions and responses of the parties to the adjudication” (s 17(3)(g) of the Act) and “any other matter that the adjudicator reasonably considers to be relevant to the adjudication” (s  17(3)(h) of the Act). The bond monies could easily fall into any of these categories and may therefore be considered by the adjudicator. The defendant’s adjudication application for example, clearly made mention of and explained how the “Amount previously paid by the [plaintiff] to the [defendant]” was derived.
