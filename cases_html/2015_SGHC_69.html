<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
appeal highlights the challenging task faced by the courts when sentencing
an offender diagnosed with a psychiatric condition. The condition
is insufficient to constitute a full defence to the criminal conduct perpetrated
by the accused but is nevertheless relevant when the particular individual
is sentenced. The multi-faceted task of tailoring the sentence to the
offender becomes further vexed by the complexities of the human
mind. It is most certainly an unenviable task.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
respondent, Chong Hou En, a 29-year-old male, pleaded guilty to five
charges under s 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”)
and a single charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev
Ed) (“Films Act”). The district judge (“the Judge”) was of the view
that a probation order was appropriate and ordered accordingly.
The Prosecution successfully applied for a stay of sentence and
now appeals against the sentence on the ground that it is manifestly
inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
respondent admitted without qualification to the following facts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The
respondent graduated from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
(Singapore Institute of Management) in 2008 and worked as a labour
relations officer. He was arrested on 6 January 2011 at IMM shopping
mall at Jurong East Street 21. The respondent had gone to the shopping
mall with the purpose of capturing “Up Skirt” videos. To facilitate this,
he had purchased a mini-camera costing about $40 from an online store.
He attached the mini-camera to the tip of his shoe with Blu-Tack.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
victim and her husband were at the Giant Hypermarket of the same
shopping mall. While they were at the Fresh Fruits section, the respondent
came up from behind the victim and placed his foot underneath the
skirt of the victim in order to film an “Up Skirt” video. The respondent attempted
to flee the scene after he was noticed by the husband of the victim.
He was detained by the victim’s husband with the help of a passer-by
after a brief struggle. He was subsequently arrested by the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In
the course of investigations, the respondent’s computers, laptops, mobile
phone, flash drives, memory cards, hard drive and pinhole cameras were
seized. A few thousand videos were found in his computer and hard drive.
The Board of Film Censors of the Media Development Authority certified
that 10,574 video films were obscene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Further
investigations of his computer equipment also revealed videos of
females showering in his girlfriend’s parents’ home. The respondent
had, from August 2010, through a series of carefully planned episodes,
recorded his girlfriend’s family members in the shower. The respondent
knew that they would take a shower once they had switched on the
water heater.  He would then enter the toilet to place a digital
camera (that was cleverly disguised as a lighter to avoid detection)
there. After the family members of his girlfriend had finished their
showers, the respondent would retrieve the camera and access the
videos.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Through
these steps, the respondent filmed the older sister of his girlfriend
(aged 30 at the time of the offence) and his girlfriend’s two young nieces
(aged 12 and ten at the time of the offence). His girlfriend’s sister-in-law
(aged 31 at the time of the offence), who was the mother of the
two nieces, was also filmed. These obscene videos captured the victims
fully nude with moving images of their breasts and vulvas. The respondent would
watch these videos and masturbate to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
respondent was thus charged and convicted of five counts of insulting
the modesty of a woman by intruding upon her privacy under s 509
of the Penal Code with respect to the victim at IMM shopping mall
and the four victims in his girlfriend’s parents’ home. He was also
charged and convicted of one count of possession of 10,574 obscene
films under s 30(1) of the Films Act. The respondent consented to
ten other charges of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509
of the Penal Code and one charge of possession of 578 video films
without a valid certificate under s 21(1)(<em>a</em>)
of the Films Act to be taken into consideration for sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Judge was of the view that the main sentencing consideration should
be rehabilitation. Noting that the maximum penalty prescribed was one
years’ imprisonment and a fine for an offence under s 509 of the
Penal Code and that an offence under s 30(1) of the Films Act brought
a maximum punishment of six months’ imprisonment and a $20,000 aggregate
fine, the Judge concluded that the offences were not serious offences.
The Judge also placed considerable weight on the medical evidence
which stated that the accused was suffering from voyeurism. He concluded
that deterrence “should not take precedence over rehabilitation as
the offender was labouring under a serious psychiatric condition
or mental disorder at the time of the incident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
Judge also concluded that the aggravating factors highlighted by the
Prosecution, which included the use of recording devices, multiple victims
including children, premeditation and elaborate planning, and the fact
that the private parts of the victims were captured, should “be
given little weight in light of the fact that the accused was suffering
from a psychiatric condition at the material time.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     According
to the Judge, imprisonment would hamper the treatment programme
of the respondent. Furthermore, the Judge was persuaded by the “exceptional
support” of the respondent’s loved ones, including his girlfriend,
whose family had also stood by and forgiven him, and his commitment
to secure his own recovery and rehabilitation. The Judge also attached
weight to the fact that the respondent had voluntarily undergone treatment
for three years and that he had not reoffended since the commission
of these offences. The Judge opined that there was no need to punish
the respondent further in the light of the fact that he was “currently suffering
from significant depressive and anxiety symptomatology” related to
the shame and stress from his commission of the offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With
all of the above factors in mind, the Judge ordered the respondent
to undergo 30 months’ split probation (three months’ intensive and
27 months’ supervised) with the following conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     to
undergo psychiatric and psychological follow-up as required by the
Institute of Mental Health (“IMH’), psychiatrist Dr Tommy Tan and
psychologist, Mr James Tan, and to take medication as prescribed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     to
attend counselling with a qualified counsellor to address his relationship
difficulties with his girlfriend and his parents;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     to
be prohibited from possessing any electronic devices with camera
facilities and to be supervised closely when accessing websites; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     his
parents and girlfriend to be bonded for $5000 to ensure his good
behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In
arguing that a custodial sentence is warranted, the Prosecution does
not challenge the diagnosis of voyeurism and fetishism. Instead,
they argue that the starting point for offences under s 509 of the
Penal Code which involve the use of recording devices should be
custodial. The Prosecution relies on the case of <em>PP
v Tay Beng Guan Albert</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 778 (“<em>Albert Tay</em>”) in support of this proposition.
I shall return to this case later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
Prosecution also submits that the severity of the offences and the aggravating
factors point towards a strong public interest in imposing a custodial
sentence. The Prosecution submits that the learned Judge erred in finding
that the offence under s 509 was not a serious offence. The prosecution
also highlights the following facts, which it argues are aggravating:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     there
was a high degree of intrusion into the privacy of victims since
some victims were recorded fully naked;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     there
were multiple victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     some
of the victims were young;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     a
video-camcorder was used; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     there
was a high degree of planning and premeditation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
Prosecution also points to an observation that there has been an annual
increase in the number of offences under s 509 of the Penal Code (“Dealing
with Mentally Ill Offenders”, <em>The Straits Times</em>,
(7 July 2012)). The prosecution submits that the offences under
s 509 of the Penal Code are a concern to public safety since camera
phones are now ubiquitous and it is not uncommon to find miniature
cameras disguised as smoke detectors, pens, cigarette lighters,
mirror clocks, car alarm key chains or even clothing hooks. A deterrent
sentence is therefore warranted to send a stern message to potential
offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Prosecution submits that rehabilitation should not override the other
penal objectives of deterrence and retribution. According to the Prosecution,
the Judge had placed excessive weight on the causal link between
the respondent’s condition of voyeurism and his commission of the
offences. The concept of general deterrence should also feature
as an important sentencing consideration, while the concept of retribution
is also relevant. The Prosecution points out that the intrusion
into the privacy of the victims by the respondent was grave. There
is also a high degree of culpability displayed by the significant
degree of planning and premeditation. Furthermore, some of these
offences involved the recording of victims in their very own homes
thus violating the safety and security that the victims would expect
from being in their own home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Given
all these factors, the Prosecution submits that the sentence of probation
is manifestly inadequate and seeks a custodial sentence of more than
four weeks’ imprisonment per charge in respect of the offences under s 509
of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Counsel
for the respondent argues that the Prosecution has failed to show
how the sentence of probation, which was imposed after a very careful consideration
of all the circumstances of the offences and the offender, is either
wrong in principle or manifestly inadequate. Counsel submits that there
is a causal link between the mental condition of voyeurism and fetishism
and the commission of the offences. Accordingly, the sentencing principle
that assumes central importance must be rehabilitation. Counsel points
to the following facts in aid of this submission:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
respondent was 28 years old at the time of the offences, had no
antecedents and has not reoffended.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
respondent comes from a good family and has a bachelor’s degree
in business management. He has put his further education on hold
because of this episode.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
respondent is truly remorseful and has made a full confession. Most
of the offences were only discovered because of his cooperation
with the police and his confessions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
respondent was arrested more than three years ago and has successfully
sought medical treatment for his condition in the interim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)     There
were no adverse effects on any of the victims. The children affected
did not know about the incident and their pictures have not been
circulated in any way. Furthermore, the respondent’s girlfriend’s
family has been forgiving and supportive of the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
whole episode has taken its toll on the respondent. However, he
has continued with his treatment and was cooperative with the probation
officer before his sentence of probation was stayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Counsel
for the respondent also argues that the Prosecution’s reliance on <em>Albert Tay</em> is inappropriate because it
was decided in 2000, before the introduction of community-based
sentencing. Furthermore, <em>Albert Tay</em> did not
involve an accused with a mental disorder. On this basis, counsel
seeks to distinguish <em>Albert Tay</em> from
the present case. Furthermore, counsel argues that if the court
establishes a norm that a custodial sentence is warranted in cases
under s 509 of the Penal Code, it would “come very close to legislating
a mandatory minimum sentence”.  Counsel also relies on the case
of <em>PP v Tan Huat Heng</em> (Magistrate’s
Appeal 25 of 2012 (unreported)) (“<em>Tan Huat
Heng</em>”) where the court set aside a custodial sentence
and imposed a term of probation on the appellant who was convicted
of four counts under s 509 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel
submits that the Judge did not err in holding that rehabilitation
was the dominant principle in this case. Counsel points to the fact
that the respondent has been diligent in his treatment and has taken
a lot of corrective steps to ensure that he will not be tempted
or inclined to commit these kinds of offences again in the future.
Imposing a term of imprisonment will ruin the efforts taken by the
respondent to secure his rehabilitation. No significant public interest
will be served by sending the respondent to prison. Accordingly,
he submits that the sentence imposed by the Judge is not manifestly
inadequate and that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The need for expert testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
Prosecution relies on diagnostic criteria to show that voyeurism and
fetishism are classed separately from impulse control disorders
which include disorders such as kleptomania and pyromania. The Prosecution submits
that the present case is different, given the high level of planning and
premeditation; it is not a situation where the acts were done on
the spur of the moment. The underlying suggestion of the Prosecution
appears to be that a person diagnosed with a voyeurism disorder
is nevertheless able to control his acts of voyeurism. However,
in my view, this must be substantiated by expert evidence. The Prosecution
then applied under s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap
68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) for further evidence to be taken by
this court in respect of expert evidence in relation to the nature
of voyeurism and whether it deprives a person suffering from the
disorder of control over his actions. I granted the application.
Both the Prosecution and the respondent called expert witnesses
to testify on the nature of voyeurism. I will deal with the expert testimonies
and my findings in relation to them below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
principles with regards to appeals on sentence are trite. In <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R)
500 (“<em>PP v UI</em>”), the Court of Appeal reiterated
the principles in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    It
is, of course, well established (see, <em>inter
alia</em>, <em>Tan Koon Swan v PP</em> [1985-1986]
SLR(R) 976  and <em>Ong Ah Tiong v PP</em> [2004]
1 SLR(R) 587 ) that an appellate court will not ordinarily disturb
the sentence imposed by the trial court except where it is satisfied
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the
trial judge erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the trial judge failed to appreciate
the materials placed before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the sentence was wrong in principle;
or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the sentence was manifestly excessive
or manifestly inadequate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    For
the purposes of the present appeal, it will be sufficient for us
to elaborate briefly on what is meant by a sentence which is "manifestly excessive"
or "manifestly inadequate", the latter being the main contention raised
by the Prosecution. A succinct explanation can be found in <em>PP v Siew Boon Loong</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611
, where Yong Pung How CJ stated (at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When a sentence is said to be manifestly
inadequate, or conversely, manifestly excessive, it means that the
sentence is unjustly lenient or severe, as the case may be, and <em>requires substantial alterations rather than minute
corrections</em> to remedy the injustice ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Similar sentiments were expressed in <em>Liton</em> ([9]<em>supra</em>),
where Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA, who delivered the judgment of
this court, stated the following (at [84]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t bears repeating that an appellate
court should only intervene where the sentence imposed by the court
below was "manifestly" inadequate - that in itself implies a <em>high threshold before intervention is warranted</em>. In
the light of the highly discretionary nature of the sentencing process and
the relatively circumscribed grounds on which appellate intervention
is warranted, the prerogative to correct sentences should be tempered
by a certain degree of deference to the sentencing judge's exercise
of discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing principle of individuals
diagnosed with psychiatric conditions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Court of Appeal has recently dealt with the relevant principles when
sentencing an offender with a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness
of mind. In <em>Lim Ghim Peow v Public Prosecutor</em> [2014]
4 SLR 1287 (“<em>Lim Ghim Peow</em>”), Chao
Hick Tin JA neatly summarised the principles at play as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    [T]he
existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always
a relevant factor in the sentencing process. The manner and extent
of its relevance depends on the circumstances of each case, in particular,
the nature and severity of the mental disorder. In fact, the existence
of a mental disorder often gives rise to contradictory sentencing
objectives. As V K Rajah JA noted in <em>PP v Goh
Lee Yin</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 824  (“<em>Goh
Lee Yin (2008)</em>”) at [1], “the paradox of sentencing the
mentally ill” is that “[s]uch illnesses can be a mitigating consideration
or point towards a future danger that may require more severe sentencing”.
This echoes what was stated by the High Court of Australia in <em>Veen v The Queen (No 2)</em> (1988) 164 CLR
465 at 476-477 (cited with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal
in <em>PP v Aniza bte Essa</em> [2009] 3
SLR(R) 327  (“<em>Aniza</em>”) at [70]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... The purposes of criminal punishment
are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and
of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform.
The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation
from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence
in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence
but sometimes they point in different directions. <em>And
so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society
when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for
a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects:
one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards
a shorter.</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    In
sentencing a mentally disordered offender, there is generally a tension
between the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence on
the one hand, and the principle of rehabilitation on the other.
The approach which our courts have adopted is that the element of <em>general</em> deterrence <em>may</em> be
given considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from
a mental disorder at the time of the offence, particularly if the
mental disorder was causally related to the offence. This was stated
by Yong Pung How CJ in the Singapore High Court case of <em>Ng So Kuen Connie v PP</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R)
178  (“<em>Connie Ng</em>”) at [58] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... [T]he element of general deterrence
can and should be given considerably less weight if the offender
was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the commission
of the offence. This is particularly so if there is a causal link
between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence. In
addition to the need for a causal link, other factors such as the
seriousness of the mental condition, the likelihood of the [offender]
repeating the offence and the severity of the crime, are factors
which have to be taken into account by the sentencing judge. In
my view, general deterrence will not be enhanced by meting out an
imprisonment term to [an offender] suffering from a serious mental
disorder which led to the commission of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    
              <b><em>That said, we should clarify that the element of
general deterrence may still be accorded full weight in some circumstances,
such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not causally
related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious
one</em></b>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    Similarly,
the sentencing principle of <em>specific</em> deterrence <em>may</em> be of limited application in cases
involving mentally disordered offenders. Whereas general deterrence
is directed at educating and deterring other like-minded members
of the general public by making an example of the particular offender
concerned, specific deterrence is directed at discouraging that
particular offender from committing offences in future (see <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022
 at [18]). The reason why specific deterrence may not be a relevant
consideration when sentencing mentally disordered offenders is that
specific deterrence is premised on the assumption that the offender
can balance and weigh consequences before committing an offence (see <em>Tan Kay Beng v PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 
at [32]). The aim of specific deterrence is to deter the particular
offender concerned from committing any further offences. <b><em>It follows that where that offender’s mental disorder
has seriously inhibited his ability to make proper choices or appreciate
the nature and quality of his actions, it is unlikely that specific
deterrence will fulfil its aim of instilling in him the fear of
re-offending. Conversely, specific deterrence may remain relevant
in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is
a conscious choice to commit the offence</em></b> (see <em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814
 at [22]). <b><em>This remains the case notwithstanding
the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the particular
offender concerned.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Rehabilitation may take precedence
where the sentencing principle of deterrence is rendered less effective
by virtue of a serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder
on the part of the offender (see <em>Goh Lee Yin
v PP</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 530  at [29]). Rehabilitation, however,
has both a public and an individual dimension (see <em>Goh
Lee Yin (2008)</em> ([25] <em>supra</em>)
at [99]). On the one hand, the courts are concerned about the welfare
of the offender and the manner of reform and treatment which is
most suitable, particularly if the offender suffers from a psychiatric
illness or other special psychiatric condition. On the other hand,
the underlying aim of rehabilitation is to advance the greater public
interest by reducing the risk of recidivism.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    It is, moreover, erroneous to assume
that rehabilitation necessarily dictates that a lighter sentence
be imposed on a mentally disordered offender. This again depends
very much on the nature of the offence as well as the nature and
severity of the offender's mental disorder. The case of <em>PP v Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684
 serves as a useful illustration. In that case, the respondent was
charged with attempting to commit culpable homicide by pushing the
victim into the path of an oncoming train at a train station. He was
diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the
offence. In the Prosecution's appeal against sentence, the Court
of Appeal observed (at [37]) that “<b><em>[w]hile
the respondent’s rehabilitation was a relevant consideration, there
was no suggestion that he could not be similarly rehabilitated in
prison”, and that “even if one were to place considerable weight
on rehabilitation as a sentencing principle, it did not necessitate
a light sentence in the current case”.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    In cases involving serious offences,
there is no reason why the retributive and protective principles
of sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation,
notwithstanding the offender's mental disorder. As Rajah JA stated
in <em>Goh Lee Yin (2008)</em> at [107]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... [T]his is not to say that in <em>all</em> offences committed owing to a psychiatric
disease, rehabilitation must be the foremost consideration. Indeed,
assuming that an offender suffers from a psychiatric disease which
causes him to commit a particular heinous offence, it would surely
not be correct to say that such an offender ought to be rehabilitated
to the exclusion of other public interests. Rehabilitation may still
be a relevant consideration, but such rehabilitation may very well
have to take place in an environment where the offender is prevented
from recommitting similar offences. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We also note with approval the commentary
in Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in
Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2009) at para 18.125 that
“the retributive principle features prominently in the sentencing
of mentally disordered offenders or intellectually challenged offenders
where the offence is <em>particularly serious or
heinous</em>” [emphasis in original]. The principle of retribution
will be particularly relevant if the offender’s mental disorder
did not seriously impair his capacity to appreciate the nature and
gravity of his actions. Protection of the public will also be a
relevant consideration in cases involving serious offences and “dangerous”
offenders, notwithstanding the fact that at the material time, the
offender was suffering from a psychiatric disorder which caused
the commission of the very offence concerned (see <em>Goh
Lee Yin (2008)</em> at [108]). Indeed, there is no reason
why the public interest of protecting society should necessarily
cease to be a relevant consideration when dealing with a mentally
disordered offender. Ultimately, the court must balance the interests
of society against those of the offender. In every case, it is often
this search for the right balance which poses the greatest difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis
added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While
the court will always be cognisant of the need for rehabilitation in
cases where the accused person is suffering from a mental disorder,
the principles with regards to sentencing an accused with a mental
disorder can be distilled, for present purposes, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
existence of a mental disorder on the part of the offender is always
a relevant factor in the sentencing process.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
manner and extent of its relevance depends on the circumstances
of each case, in particular, the nature and severity of the mental
disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
element of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight
in some circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not
serious or is not causally related to the commission of the offence, and
the offence is a serious one.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused,
specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence
is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the
offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     If
the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence
less effective, where for instance the offender has a significantly
impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions,
then rehabilitation may take precedence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     Even
though rehabilitation may be a relevant consideration, it does not
necessarily dictate a light sentence. The accused could also be rehabilitated
in prison.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_g"></a>(g)     Finally,
in cases involving particularly heinous or serious offences, even
when the accused person is labouring under a serious mental disorder,
there is no reason why the retributive and protective principles
of sentencing should not prevail over the principle of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Given
that the presence of a diagnosis of a mental disorder is in most cases
a mitigating factor which the court <em>may</em> take
into account when sentencing the offender, its significance in terms
of mitigating value depends on the factors and principles enumerated
above. These include specifically factors such as the causal link,
the nature and severity of the mental disorder and the offender’s
ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and
quality of his actions. As explained at length, these are particularly
important when determining the appropriate sentencing principles
which should be engaged in the sentencing exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In
fact, the court must pay particular attention to the <em>nature</em> of the mental disorder when the
disorder is one which invariably manifests itself in the doing of
the very act which is criminalised. If the very diagnostic criteria
include the invariable manifestation of an act which is criminalised, a
causal link, <em>however tenuous</em>, would
almost certainly be present. It may even be circular to speak of
causation, simply on that premise – the diagnosis is based on the
acting out of the criminal behaviour while the criminal behaviour
is explicable by the presence of the mental disorder. The prosecution
ably demonstrates the difficulty in such cases since it would mean
the more a person engaged in the criminal behaviour, the more serious
the disorder is and the greater the mitigating value the disorder carries.
This cannot be correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Therefore,
in this particular genus of mental disorders, the concept of a causal
link may not be particularly useful, or even that relevant for determining
the mitigating value to be ascribed to the mental disorder. In my
view, where the “severity” of the mental disorder in an individual
is assessed with respect to the “frequency” of the criminal act
and there is a positive correlation between the “severity” and the
“frequency”, then the severity and nature of the individual’s mental
disorder ought not to be regarded as a mitigating factor without
first examining in detail the <em>nature</em> of
the mental disorder, in terms of how it has affected the individual’s ability
or capacity to control or refrain himself from committing the criminal
acts and whether punishment will be able to instil fear in him and deter
him from committing the same criminal acts in future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     If
the nature of the mental disorder is such that the individual retains substantially
the mental ability or capacity to control or refrain himself when
he commits the criminal acts but he instead chooses not to exercise his
self-control, and if it is also shown that punishment will be effective
in instilling fear in him and thereby deter him from committing
the same criminal acts in the future, I will attribute very little
or no mitigating value to the presence of the mental disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     If
there is evidence to show that the individual is not able or is substantially
not able to control or refrain himself from committing the criminal
acts because of the mental disorder and similarly, punishment is unlikely
to be effective in instilling fear in him and to deter him from committing
the same criminal acts in future because of the mental disorder, then
the principle of deterrence may be given less weight and rehabilitation may
well take precedence provided that the treatment mandated as part
of his rehabilitation is going to be effective in treating the mental
disorder and in reducing the risk of recidivism. Nevertheless, if
the criminal offences committed are just too serious in nature,
the principle of rehabilitation may well have to give way to the
principle of retribution and protection of the public at large.
Ultimately, the factual circumstances will govern how all these
different factors, pulling in different directions, are going to
interact. The court must judiciously weigh these various factors
and arrive at a fair and just sentence that is appropriate in all
the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     A
few illustrations of the judicial treatment of different mental disorders
will be useful to elucidate the appropriate approach to take in
the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Goh Lee Yin</em> [2008]
1 SLR(R) 824  (“<em>Goh Lee Yin</em>”) V
K Rajah JA dealt with the applicable principles when sentencing
a person diagnosed with kleptomania. Rajah JA in his analysis examined
the nature of kleptomania as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The psychiatric disorder
of kleptomania</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The nature of kleptomania</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    Kleptomania
(Greek: , kleptein, “to steal”, , “mania”) is an impulse control
disorder characterised by the inability to resist impulses to steal objects
that are not generally acquired for personal use or monetary gain.
The individual concerned describes a compulsive urge to steal. The
behaviour is classically accompanied by an increasing sense of tension
before, and a palpable sense of relief immediately after and during
the act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    As
to the peculiar features of kleptomania, the essential diagnostic criterion
is the recurrent failure to resist the impulse to steal items that
are not needed for personal use or that have little personal value.
The individual concerned may experience a rising sense of tension
before the theft, and then experience gratification and/or anxiety
reduction afterwards. Typically, the objects stolen usually have
little value, and the person sometimes offers to pay for them, or
may give them away, or sometimes hoards them. What is especially
cogent in this respect is perhaps the absurdity of the act - what
is stolen is not generally needed. For example, Dr Phang testified
in court that he had experience dealing with kleptomaniacs who stole
such items as eggs or even soap and tissue rations while in prison.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    Further, whereas the thefts of most
shoplifters have personal gain as the typical motivation for the
act, the acts of thefts of kleptomaniacs do not. In this regard,
the “gain” there is the relief obtained from the sense of the unbearable
anxiety and tension prior to each episode of theft. Goods are not generally
stolen for their material value, although Dr Phang took pains to point
out that valuable objects may also on occasion be stolen by genuine kleptomaniacs.
This would, however, be the exception rather than the norm. In court,
Dr Phang stated that this would happen if the kleptomaniac concerned
felt his or her irresistible urges when in the vicinity of a valuable item
- the urge to steal would then be relieved by the taking of such
objects, and the taking is not motivated by the material cost of
the object taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    Finally, kleptomania is now thought
to have a biological basis, a deduction supported by the efficacy
of treatment with long-term medication. Elaborating in court, Dr
Phang said that kleptomania is thought to be associated with the
deficiency of some neurological function of the brain. It is more
prevalent among women. The behaviour may be sporadic with long intervals
of remission, or may persist for years despite repeated prosecutions. In
short, it is an enigmatic condition, the diagnosis of which must
necessarily be made after the exclusion of all other causes of the
repeated thefts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the context of the appropriate
place for specific deterrence when sentencing kleptomaniacs, Rajah
JA said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79    In
my view, the theory of “undeterribility”, as canvassed by Nigel Walker
and Nicola Padfield in <em>Sentencing: Theory,
Law and Practice</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996) at p 99,
is of keen relevance to the present case. As the learned authors
point out, there are some afflictions or ailments which render deterrence
specific to the offender futile. In particular, they state that “[m]ental
illnesses can preoccupy or mislead sufferers to an extent that makes the
consequences of their actions irrelevant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    Kleptomania can rightly be considered
one such ailment. By definition, it is an <em>impulse
control disorder</em> which subjects the sufferer to an intense
and almost unbearable desire to steal. Further, kleptomania is thought
to have a biological cause - this only serves to substantiate the
point that the sufferer may not be fully able to control his or
her actions prior to and while committing the offence. Accordingly,
once kleptomania is properly established, it must be accepted that
the deterrence specific to the offender must necessarily be limited,
because his or her future <em>actual commission
of the offence concerned</em> is not primarily deterred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Dealing with general deterrence,
Rajah JA said at <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Perhaps one could argue that the prevalence
of the offences by the respondent and the difficulty of detection
and/or apprehension in shoplifting cases could warrant the imposition
of a sentence which properly reflects the need for general deterrence,
but given the general “undeterribility” of kleptomania (see [79]
above), any general deterrence would be futile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
1 SLR(R) 37 (“<em>Kelvin Lim</em>”), Yong
Pung How CJ, dealing with paedophilia, stated at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were no significant mitigating factors
in this case. The learned judge had found, rightly in our opinion,
that paedophilia is not a disease or a physical illness but is a
disorder. According to the <em>American Psychiatric Association:
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (3rd
Ed, 1980), paedophilia is a condition where there is recurrent and
intense sexually-arousing fantasies, sexual urges or sexual activities
involving prepubertal children. Even if paedophilia is an illness,
we reject any suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and therefore
carries only a diminished responsibility for his actions. There
is no evidence that paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of
responsibility and self-control. The learned judge found that the
appellant had a choice of whether to commit paedophilic offences
against the victims, and chose to do so. The psychiatrist who examined
the appellant expressed the opinion that treatment of paedophilia
was difficult. Given the high recidivism rate of offenders, the
learned judge took the view that the appellant had to be removed
from society for a long period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     From
the foregoing, it is clear that both <em>Goh Yee
Lin</em> (explicitly) and <em>Kelvin Lim</em> (implicitly)
had examined the <em>nature</em> of kleptomania
and paedophilia respectively before deciding on the mitigating value
to be attached to the disorder. Both kleptomania and paedophilia
manifest themselves in the very act criminalised. The High Court
in <em>Goh Yee Lin</em> and the Court of
Appeal in <em>Kelvin Lim</em> came to different
conclusions on the <em>nature</em> of kleptomania
and paedophilia respectively and thus ascribed differing mitigating
values to each of the mental disorders. The High Court attached
significant mitigating value to the diagnosis of kleptomania because
of the “undeterribility” of the disorder given that it is an impulse control
disorder and the “sufferer may not be fully able to control his
or her actions prior to and while committing the offence”. In the
light of this, deterrence was rendered less effective and rehabilitation
formed the primary focus. The Court of Appeal, on the other hand,
attached little or no weight to the disorder of paedophilia since
it rejected any “suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and
therefore carries only a diminished responsibility for his actions”.
The Court of Appeal further concluded that there was “no evidence
that paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of responsibility
and self-control”. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal were
focused on the self-control or lack thereof of the sufferer of the disorder.
This to my mind is also the correct inquiry. In addition, if a significant
lack of control is established, the circularity discussed above
at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>, in
the context of the causal link for disorders which invariably manifest
themselves in criminalised conduct, disappears. A proper causal link,
free from circularity, from the disorder to the commission of the offence,
is thus established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     However,
I must add that these observations should generally be confined
to cases where the disorder is one which invariably manifests itself in
criminal conduct (psychiatric descriptive labels of criminal/deviant conduct).
Where the disorder is one which may manifest itself in different ways,
some of which are criminal and others perhaps not, the concept of
a causal link is still relevant and useful. In <em>Lim
Ghim Peow</em>, the appellant who was suffering from major
depressive disorder at the time of the offence, had doused his girlfriend
with petrol and set her ablaze with a lighter. The appellant was
charged and convicted of a charge of culpable homicide not amounting
to murder under s 304(<em>a</em>) of the
Penal Code and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment. In dismissing
the appeal against conviction the Court of Appeal made the following
observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    …
While Dr Goh did state in the 2nd Psychiatric Report that the Appellant’s
major depressive disorder would have impaired his degree of self-control
and his decision-making capacity with regard to the offence, Dr
Goh also opined in that report that the Appellant did not appear
to lack “the capacity to comprehend the events or the capacity to
appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions” (see [42] above). Dr
Goh’s opinion was that the Appellant's major depressive disorder,
coupled with his violent and impulsive personality, led him to decide
on the course of action that resulted in the death of the Deceased.
This, however, did not mean that the Appellant could not comprehend
the gravity of his actions or the wrongfulness of his conduct. As
both Dr Goh and the Judge noted, the Appellant formed the intention
to kill the Deceased some time before the commission of the offence,
and carried out his plan in quite a meticulous manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    The Judge therefore did not err in
drawing a distinction between, on the one hand, the present case
and, on the other hand, cases where the mental disorder had completely
dispossessed the offender of his awareness of the nature and illegality
of his actions or where the offender had committed the offence on
impulse due to his mental disorder. Here, the Appellant had carefully
planned his moves - he had decided to take the Deceased's life and his
own too, reasoning that if he could not have the Deceased, then
no one else should have her. We should clarify at this juncture
that there is an erroneous statement of fact at [60] of the Judgment
(quoted at [49] above). The Appellant was first diagnosed as having
a major depressive disorder in December 2011, <em>before</em> the
commission of the offence, and not (as the Judge stated) after his
arrest for the offence. However, this error was not material and
does not detract from what we have said in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    In the light of the nature of the Appellant's
major depressive disorder and its effect on the commission of the
offence, we were of the view that the Judge did not err in considering
retribution and prevention instead of rehabilitation to be the primary
sentencing principles that were applicable in this case. A mental
disorder, even if it substantially impaired the offender's mental
responsibility for the commission of the offence and thereby reduced the
offence (in the context of the offence of culpable homicide under
s 299 of the Code) from that of murder to that of culpable homicide
not amounting to murder, cannot be invoked as a blanket excuse for
every aspect of the offender's criminal conduct. In every case,
it is imperative that the sentencing court examine the nature and
gravity of the offender's mental disorder and its impact on the
commission of the offence before arriving at a sentence that takes
into account and balances the relevant sentencing objectives. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The major depressive order
in <em>Lim Ghim Peow</em> amounted to an
abnormality of mind and there was a significant impairment of his
decision-making capacity with regard to the offence (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>). This, coupled
with the appellant’s already violent and impulsive propensity related
to his personality attributes, resulted in him committing the offence.
It would be meaningful to speak of a causal link here to determine
the correlation between the disorder and the commission of the offence
since it is not riddled with the same circularity issues mentioned
above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>.
However, as seen from the above passage, the presence of the causal
link in <em>Lim Ghim Peow</em> was not a
sufficient condition to the disorder being given significant mitigating
value in the light of the particularly heinous nature of the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With
the above in mind, I now turn to the expert evidence on the nature
of voyeurism.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Expert evidence on “voyeurism”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
Prosecution’s expert is Dr Stephen Phang Boon Chye (“Dr Phang”).
He is currently a senior consultant at the Department of General
and Forensic Psychiatry at Institute of Mental Health, Woodbridge Hospital.
He is also an adjunct assistant professor at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical
School and was until July 2013, a clinical senior lecturer at the Yong
Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Dr
Phang refers primarily to the diagnostic criteria contained in both the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (American Psychiatric
Publishing, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2013) (“DSM-5”) and <em>The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural
Disorders</em> (World Health Organisation, 1993) (“ICD-10”)
to form his opinion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Dr Phang also produces
various secondary materials in support of his expert opinion. Dr Phang’s
expert opinion is summarised neatly in his medical report dated
13 June 2014 as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, I am of the considered opinion
that while Voyeuristic Disorder is indeed a diagnostic category
described in DSM-5 (‘Voyeurism’ in ICD-10), it merely represents
a clinical description of what is essentially a perverse behavioural
option, principally characterized by the deviant desire to repeatedly
observe/record unsuspecting others in various compromising states/behaviours,
primarily for the purpose of self-sexual gratification. The behaviours
associated with this entity are usually deliberate, planned and
well within the self-control of the individual concerned. It does
not deprive the individual of the requisite <em>mens
rea</em>, and should not, therefore, exculpate or exonerate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Dr
Phang testifies that voyeurism forms part of a general family known
as paraphilias. Paraphilias include, for example, paedophilia, voyeurism
and exhibitionism. According to Dr Phang:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term ‘paraphilia’ denotes … any intense
and persistent sexual interest <b>other than</b> sexual
interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically
normal, physically mature and consenting human partners. A ‘paraphilic
disorder’ is a paraphilia which has caused distress and/or impairment
to the individual, or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal
harm, risk of harm to others.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There are three general
characteristics common to all paraphilias. Firstly, there is a longstanding,
unusual and highly arousing erotic preoccupation which is dehumanised
for most of the adolescent and adult life of the person. The fantasy
is often associated with preoccupying arousal and relies heavily
on the image of a partner who does not possess personhood. The paraphilic
fantasies are conscious and clearly known to the individual. Secondly,
there is an urge to act out the fantasy or “to play out the imagined erotic
scenario, which in more intense forms is described as an urge to
act out the imagined fantasy in sexual behaviour”, usually in masturbation.
The acting out of the sexual fantasy is fundamentally motivated
by a sexual behavioural aberration and is not driven by any form
of irresistibility. “[T]he mental capacity to effect a behavioural
choice <u>always remains intact</u>. It
is basically a disordered sexual <u>preference</u>,
or, in simple layman parlance, <u>a sexual deviancy</u>.”
[emphasis in original]. Thirdly, there is often significant, or
even severe sexual dysfunction involving normal desire, arousal
or orgasm with a partner, especially so in married individuals. “Paraphilias
are <u>sexual identity disorders</u> that
render normal eroticism and sexual love <u>unattainable</u>.”
[emphasis in original].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Dr
Phang attests that the diagnostic criteria for voyeurism (based
on the ICD-10 and DSM-5) are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Over
a period of at least six months, recurrent and intense arousal from

disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies,

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
individual has acted on these sexual urges with a non-consenting

areas of functioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     The

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Dr
Phang also states that the diagnostic criteria for voyeurism apply
if the disclosing individual “also reports subjective distress (guilt,
shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychological problems, <em>sexual impulsivity</em>, or hypersexuality
as a consequence of their voyeuristic sexual preferences”. [emphasis
added]. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Although
Dr Phang states that there is some form of sexual impulsivity, he
clarifies that this impulsivity is a symptom and the presence of
some form of impulsivity on the part of the person diagnosed with
voyeurism does not make voyeurism a form of impulse-control disorder.
Dr Phang explains that the “<b><u>inability to
resist </u></b><u>the impulse</u> is
by definition the common core of all impulse-control disorders.” [emphasis
in original].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
impulsivity is defined as the rapid and sudden expression of unplanned
behaviour and the primary connotation of impulsivity is the irresistibility
of the urge to act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> According
to Dr Phang, the mental faculties of a person diagnosed with voyeurism
are “often extremely nimble, with the unfettered ability to cogitate
and plan coherently and deliberately” and in fact, in “order to
successfully carry out the voyeuristic fantasy, the individual is
generally obliged to plan quite extensively, such as purchasing
the requisite paraphernalia, and then carefully (and often creatively)
facilitating the filming, or recording of voyeuristic images”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Therefore,
Dr Phang is clear that voyeurism does not deprive a person of self-control.
Any impulsivity a person feels as a result of his voyeuristic tendencies
is a symptom. This does not, however, make voyeurism an impulse-control
disorder which is the specific diagnostic umbrella in the DSM-5
for disorders which deprive a person of self-control. The following disorders
are listed, <em>inter alia</em>, in the DSM-5
under the umbrella of impulse-control disorder: oppositional defiant
disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial
personality disorder, pyromania and kleptomania.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Dr
Phang then concludes in his report that voyeurism is merely a descriptive
diagnostic label for what is basically a perversion, or perverse form
of behaviour which deliberately and wilfully intrudes into the inviolable
sanctity and privacy of others. He stresses that it is not a mental illness
which is beyond the conscious voluntary control of the individual concerned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
expert for the defence is Dr Tommy Tan Kay Seng (“Dr Tan”). He is
currently a consultant psychiatrist in Novena Psychiatric Clinic, Novena
Medical Centre. He was previously a senior consultant at Woodbridge
Hospital. He was also a visiting consultant at the Department of
Psychiatry, Changi General Hospital, between 2012 and 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Dr
Tan agrees with Dr Phang on several aspects including the diagnostic
criteria for voyeurism and the fact that it is not classified as
part of the family known as impulse-control disorders. However,
Dr Tan states in his expert report that patients “with paraphilias
are <u>compelled</u> to plan and to execute
these acts.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
in original]. According to his report, the patient is compelled
to plan and execute his acts in order to obtain sexual arousal.
He specifically states in his report that the respondent “was in
a position that he was not able to control his actions due to his mental
disorder” and that he “was compelled to buy the equipment or else he
would not be able to obtain his sexual arousal and satisfaction.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Dr Tan
also opines that the “causal link between a mental disorder and
an offence need not necessarily be an inability to control an impulse
such as in kleptomania or pyromania”; it could also be a compulsion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Dr
Tan also refers to psychiatric literature which alludes to the impulsivity
associated with those diagnosed with paraphilias. Dr Tan finally disagrees
with Dr Phang’s description of voyeurism as a perverse behavioural
option in that, according to him, Dr Phang’s analysis seems to suggest
that voyeurism is not a mental disorder “but a behaviour that a person
can choose to have or not to have.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having
had the benefit of reading the expert reports and hearing both experts
give oral testimony in court on 4 and 5 November 2014, I prefer
the expert opinion of Dr Phang as I find that it is more logical,
and is corroborated by psychiatric literature and by another doctor
who examined the respondent. I also find that Dr Tan and Dr Phang
are in agreement in many respects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
choosing between the two experts, I am aware that Dr Phang did not
at any point examine the respondent but Dr Tan has had the benefit
of examining the respondent. However, this point is irrelevant since
the prosecution does not seek to challenge the diagnosis of voyeurism.
The experts were engaged in order to assist the court in shedding
light on the nature of voyeurism – specifically whether it deprives
a voyeur of his exercise of self-control at the various stages of
preparation to the stage when he acts out his fantasies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Dr
Phang has also stated the following in his evidence-in-chief which demonstrates
his clinical expertise when it comes to paraphilias in general:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Thank
you, Dr Phang. Dr Phang, in paragraph 6 of your report, you state
that your expert---</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">---opinion is also based on your clinical
experience. Can you tell the Court how often you treat people with
paraphilias?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your Honour, it would be a very difficult
question to answer because it happens constantly, Your Honour. It’s---I
have been in forensic psychiatry for 16 years now and even before
that---</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">---in my earlier psychiatric career,
I encountered individuals with paraphilias or (<em>sic</em>)
one kind or another. So it would be impossible to put a number,
if that is what the learned prosecutor is---but, er, it happens
on a regular basis, Your Honour. It is, in a manner of speaking,
bread and butter. One of the bread and butter issues of forensic
psychiatry.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In
terms of credentials and relevant experience, both Dr Phang and Dr
Tan have impressive <em>curricula vitae</em> with
vast clinical experience in their fields and have held high-level
appointments. They have appeared as experts to assist the court
in psychiatry-related matters over the years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Dr
Phang has emphasised that a person with voyeurism remains in full
control of his actions. Dr Phang however acknowledges that there
could be symptoms of impulsivity on the part of the person diagnosed
with voyeurism but the person at all times retains control over
his actions. Dr Phang explains the concept of impulsivity in his
evidence-in-chief as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Would
you agree that someone suffering from voyeuristic disorder would
have some problems with impulsivity?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Of course, Your Honour, but that is
impulsivity in the layman understanding of the term. And here I
emphasise that the difference is vital because the layman understanding
of impulsivity is one issue and the clinical understanding of impulsivity
as an impulse control disorder is another matter altogether.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So does the presence---</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">---of impulsivity as a symptom equate to
any disorder being an impulse control disorder?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No,
Your Honour, not at all. It is settled psychiatry that many psychiatric
disorders will have impulsivity as a symptom and I have actually
explained this in my subsequent report, I believe dated 28th October.
You know, for example, a schizophrenic may act impulsively because
he’s disturbed by hearing voices. A person with mania who has got
abnormally elated and elevated mood, Your Honour, may spend excessively,
may make faulty judgments and embark upon---such as, er, an individual
I know who ordered three Jaguars---three Jaguar cars when he was
in a manic state … Of course, a depressed individual may be impulsive
and in the moment of impulse may commit suicide and jump off a building.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So---so there are various aspects to impulsivity
as a symptom versus the impulsivity of impulse control disorders,
which are specific diagnostic umbrella entity in---in DSM, Your
Honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Your Honour, an impulse---an individual
suffering from an impulse control disorder is, to put it very simply,
a sick person. All right, he---he experiences clinically significant
impulses which he cannot resist. You know, he may---he may pull
out---or she or more often may pull out hair, which is---which is
not a normal activity - pull out his own hair from his head which
is not a normal activity and they try their best to resist it because
they recognise the harmfulness of such behaviour. But they cannot
resist it by definition; that is inherent in a definition of an
impulse control disorder. Whereas in voyeuristic disorder, there
is usually no attempt to resist it because it is enjoyable; it is
ego-syntonic. It fulfils a purpose, Your Honour. One common observation,
Your Honour, is that an individual with voyeuristic disorder may
be undergoing a period of stress, so they then engage in a voyeuristic behaviour,
or paint the voyeuristic images in one way or another through deliberate
and meticulous planning. After which, they then masturbate to---while
watching these obtained images and thereby obtain their sexual gratification,
and the release of tension from their original stressor. And then
they move on in life, until the next stressor comes along.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So that---it is---it’s just basically a
mild adaptive response very often to---to stress, or it may not
even be that at all. That is being rather kind to a---to the---to
a individual with voyeuristic disorder. Some individuals with voyeuristic
disorders simply just wish that is, in a nutshell, their sex life,
Your Honour. They do not engage in a normal sex life with normal
consenting human partners and that has supplanted their sex life.
In other words, it is---becomes what we call “exclusive”. Every
paraphilia has a---carries a qualifier, Your Honour. It could be
exclusive, it could be non-exclusive. If it is non-exclusive, it means
that they engage in a paraphilic behaviour, whatever it may be, but
they also have a normal sex life. But---or it may be sub-par because for
the simple reason that, you know, it is basically---erm, they are
also basically preoccupied. Or it may be completely exclusive in
a sense that they have no normal sex life and they con---and their
sex life consist of the voyeuristic behaviour or the paraphilic
behaviour. And they do not resist the impulse simply because it
operates, as I stated earlier, on a pleasure principle and nothing
more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Dr
Tan, as mentioned above, has stated that a person suffering from voyeurism
is compelled to perform the acts to relieve the intense urges to perform
sexual acts and feel a release of tension after the act. However, when
questioned further, Dr Tan seems to accept the distinction between impulsivity
and a loss of control which characterises an impulse-control disorder:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     This
shows that both Dr Phang and Dr Tan are in general agreement about
what a proper loss of control entails and that voyeurism does not amount
to this. In so far as Dr Tan is speaking about a person being compelled
to act in a certain way, including the preparatory phases to facilitate
the commission of the voyeuristic act, Dr Phang accepts this impulsivity
as a symptom. I am convinced by the explanation given by Dr Phang
that the compulsion here is not used in the strict clinical sense
to mean a loss of control. In his report, Dr Phang states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Tan has also apparently confused impulsivity
as a symptom, versus impulsivity as manifested in Impulse-Control
Disorders. It is settled psychiatry that impulsivity is, in fact,
a symptom which is frequently associated with almost any psychiatric
disorder – or, for that matter, it may not even be necessarily associated
with any formal disorder at all, but merely manifest as an expression
of the individual’s underlying personality and constitution, and
of the specific frustrations in his current social context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I
find greater logical force in the opinion by Dr Phang. I find it difficult
to accept that a person remains in a constant state of arousal due
to voyeurism even throughout the preparatory phases which include
the purchasing of the paraphernalia and the attaching of a recording
device to his body or placement of the recording device in an inconspicuous
location to avoid detection. Such elaborate planning over a relatively
long period of time cannot be said to be done under compulsion,
in the sense that it entails a total or even a significant and continuous
loss of control throughout the preparatory stages to the eventual
voyeurism acts that constitute the offences in question. Dr Phang
convincingly states during cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Dr
Phang reiterates that voyeurism is not a mental illness and is only
a mental disorder insofar as it is included in the pages of the
DSM-5.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> According to Dr Phang, it is a disorder
insofar as it represents a clinical description of an individual
who is seriously irresponsible, and who repeatedly transgresses
against societal norms, rules and regulations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Dr Phang repeats in his report
that voyeurism is merely a descriptive diagnostic label for what
is basically a perversion, or perverse form of behaviour which deliberately
and wilfully intrudes into the inviolable sanctity and privacy of
others. Basically, acts of voyeurism are the result of conscious
choices made by the voyeur to satisfy a deviant desire. He stresses that
it is not a mental illness nor it is a disorder beyond the control
of the individual concerned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Dr
Phang accepts that voyeurism is mentioned in the ICD-10 and DSM-5
but further explains that the ICD-10 and DSM-5 are operationalised
diagnostic criteria developed to meet the needs of clinicians and
research investigators, rather than the technical needs of the courts
and legal professionals. He derives support for this from the following
excerpt from the “Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5”
(reproduced in his report as follows)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the use of DSM-5 should be informed by
an awareness of the risks and limitations of its use in forensic
settings. When DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descriptions
are employed for forensic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic
information will be misused or misunderstood. These dangers arise
because of the imperfect fit between questions of ultimate concern
to the law and the information contained in the clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Dr
Tan states in his report in reply to Dr Phang that psychiatrists
and other mental health professionals can still use the DSM-5 and/or
ICD-10 to diagnose mental disorders. With the aid of the diagnostic
criteria, psychiatrists can confidently diagnose a person and also
communicate that diagnosis to another health professional. However,
he alleges that Dr Phang has chosen to quote a limited portion from
the cautionary statement of the DSM-5 and this may result in a reader
being misled to conclude that psychiatrists should not use the DSM-5
or ICD-10 in diagnosing a mental disorder but only as a clinical
guide when writing a forensic report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I
think this is hardly the case. In fact, Dr Phang and Dr Tan are
again in agreement. Dr Phang is essentially saying that the DSM-5
and ICD-10 are primarily used for the purpose of diagnosis which
is in complete congruence with what Dr Tan is saying. Dr Phang is
not saying, as Dr Tan alleges, that the DSM-5 and ICD-10 should
not be used for purpose of diagnosis. What Dr Phang does say is
that one must be aware and cognisant of the fact that DSM-5 and
ICD-10 are developed to primarily aid clinicians in diagnosis. Therefore,
Dr Phang warns that care must be taken before these diagnostic labels
are applied in a court of law. To me this is only logical. When
a clinician diagnoses, he does so primarily for the purpose of treatment
of the individual. A court of law, when sentencing an individual, is
concerned with the appropriate punishment to be imposed given all
the circumstances of the case, including the psychiatric condition
of the individual. Since there is a difference of purpose, Dr Phang
warns against the direct importation of these diagnostic criteria
into a court of law for forensic purposes. What this essentially
means is that just because a disorder is stated or described in
DSM-5 or ICD-10 does not <em>automatically</em> lead
to it being a mitigating factor. This point, Dr Tan does not address. Moreover,
Dr Tan has constantly referred to voyeurism as a disorder because
it is referred to in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. He seems to have taken it
for granted that just because voyeurism is mentioned in the DSM-5
and ICD-10, it is <em>automatically</em> a
mitigating factor <em>per se</em> without
the need to further establish whether or not the voyeur is able
to control himself when he plans, takes preparatory steps and eventually
commits the acts of voyeurism. This is not correct. Counsel for
the respondent has also missed this point. In his written submissions,
counsel argues that “if Dr Phang is not prepared to hold Voyeuristic
Disorder as a mental disorder, then it follows that all other disorders
classified under the DSM would also not be disorders, and this would
include ‘impulse control disorder[s]’”. At the risk of repetition,
I must stress that just because a disorder is included within the pages
of the DSM-5 and ICD-10 does not <em>automatically</em> mean
a court of law will attribute weight to the disorder as a substantial
mitigating factor for the reasons stated above. The diagnosis must
be supported by a clinical expert’s opinion on the <em>nature</em> of
the disorder and how it affects an individual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It
follows that even if a disorder is not included in the DSM-5 or
ICD-10 but a clinical expert explains the nature and seriousness
of the mental disorder, and how it affects the individual and causes
him to commit the offences, <em>and if the court
accepts the expert’s testimony</em>, then the court can ascribe
the appropriate weight to the disorder as a mitigating factor. This should
not be seen as a licence for counsel to raise reports pertaining
to all sorts of disorders because the Prosecution will always be
entitled to challenge the expert report by calling its own expert,
which is exactly what has happened in this case. It is also apposite
at this juncture to note that the court is entitled to reduce the
weight attributed to remorse as a mitigating factor if unmeritorious
Newton hearings are done such that time and costs are wasted (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Azuar Bin Ahamad</em> [2014]
SGHC 149 at [120]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Finally,
Dr Phang’s opinion is supported by Dr Ravichandran Nigila (“Dr Nigila”)
of the Institute of Mental Health, Woodbridge Hospital who had interviewed
the respondent. Dr Nigila opines in her report dated 15 July 2014
that the respondent was diagnosed with paraphilia but that he “did
not have any mental disorder and was not in a position where he
could not control his actions at the time the events happened”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> This undergirds Dr
Phang’s opinion that voyeurism (although mentioned in the DSM-5
and ICD-10) is merely a descriptive label for a perverse form of
behaviour. Counsel for the respondent claims that Dr Nigila’s report
is contradictory to the previous two reports prepared by Dr Nigala
(dated 21 December 2012 and 7 February 2013). I do not agree. Dr
Nigila’s report on 15 July 2014 merely clarifies her earlier reports.
Dr Nigila has maintained that the respondent was diagnosed with
voyeurism but in the report dated 15 July 2014 explains that voyeurism
is not a mental disorder nor does it deprive the person diagnosed
with voyeurism control over his actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In
sum, I accept Dr Phang’s testimony that voyeurism is merely a clinical
description of what is essentially a perverse behavioural option
and that it does not deprive a person of his self-control in the
way that an impulse control disorder does. I am thus satisfied that
the respondent had full control over his actions in the light of
his high degree of planning and premeditation when committing the
offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Before
I leave this point, counsel for the respondent has made much of
the fact that Dr Phang did not produce literature in support of
his opinion when Dr Phang was giving his oral testimony. Dr Phang
explained that these principles were to his mind elementary but
could nevertheless produce the literature in support of his opinion.
Dr Phang produced 13 secondary materials in support of his opinion
on the very next day. Counsel did not raise any more questions in
relation to the literature produced by Dr Phang. However in his
written submissions, counsel has taken issue with Dr Phang’s reliance
on some of his literature. On the assumption that counsel is now
allowed to challenge the reliance on the literature when he did
not raise these questions to Dr Phang during cross-examination,
I find that his individual nit-picking at the literature that Dr
Phang has produced does not detract from my assessment of his evidence.
I agree that the literature produced does not unequivocally support
Dr Phang’s view but it also does not unequivocally support Dr Tan’s
view. Counsel has tried to show that Dr Phang is the <em>only one in the world</em> to hold his view.
I find that this is not borne out by his submissions. The literature
shows that there is some support for both Dr Phang’s and Dr Tan’s
view when it comes to the nature of paraphilias. However it must
be remembered that when the court assesses expert evidence, the
court is scrutinising the expert witness as a whole including his
credentials, relevant experience, bases for the opinion and the
consistency and logic of his opinion (see <em>Sakthivel
Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983
at <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>–<a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>). It is a holistic assessment
of the expert witnesses and their evidence and it is on this basis that
I prefer Dr Phang’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appropriate sentence to impose</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It
is pertinent to note that my conclusion on the nature of voyeurism, <em>ie</em>, it is merely a clinical description
of what is essentially a perverse behavioural option and it does
not deprive a person of his self-control, is in line with the Court
of Appeal’s assessment of paedophilia as a mitigating factor in <em>Kelvin Lim</em>. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>, voyeurism
and paedophilia are both paraphilias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In
the light of this, I am of the view that the Judge had erred in attributing
significant weight to the fact that the respondent was suffering from
voyeurism such that the principles of deterrence were overridden.
The Judge had also erred in finding that the aggravating factors
present should be accorded little weight in the light of the respondent’s
diagnosis of voyeurism. Before dealing with the relevant aggravating
and mitigating factors, I turn first to the two most relevant sentencing
principles – deterrence and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Both
general and specific deterrence are principles which should feature
in the final sentence to be meted out. For the reasons submitted
by the prosecution (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>), I am in agreement that general deterrence
is particularly relevant. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera
functions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions
come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper
to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting
women almost anywhere. As this case has demonstrated, even a home,
which is often considered a sanctuary, is not free from the machinations
of one determined to satisfy his deviant sexual fantasies. As shall
be observed, these were considerations that the court in <em>Albert Tay</em> took into account when allowing
the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. The need for general
deterrence is even more pressing now than during the time that <em>Albert Tay</em> was decided, given how far
technology has advanced. Cameras have shrunk remarkably in size
while the clarity with which images are captured has improved. The
miniaturisation of cameras has made it increasingly easier for them
to be concealed and harder for victims to detect, thereby encouraging
voyeurs to take more risks. This may in part explain why voyeurism
offences are rapidly on the rise. In addition, the ease with which
videos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this
day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence. Unimaginable
shame and distress to the victims may be caused if the videos are
disseminated worldwide via the Internet. Although in this case no videos
were uploaded and disseminated, the danger, which is not fanciful but
very real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant
a deterrent sentence. I am in full agreement that a strong message
should be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements
in technology.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Specific
deterrence is also relevant given that I have found that voyeurism
merely represents a descriptive label for a perverse behavioural option
and that it does not deprive the person diagnosed of his self-control. In
any event, even Dr Tan has stated in cross-examination that those diagnosed
with voyeurism can be deterred by the threat of punishment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Rehabilitation
is also relevant given that even Dr Phang has testified that a person
diagnosed with voyeurism can be treated. Dr Phang explains the treatment
methods as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Dr

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, indeed, Your Honour, and I myself
prescribe such medication for similar disorders. But I emphasize
that we do not have medication which is specific for voyeurism,
or voyeuris---or paraphilic disorders. What we use are selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, very commonly, Your Honour, or SSRIs
for short, er, as it is commonly referred to in the profes---in
our professional parlance. SSRIs are anti-depressants. They are
not anti-paraphilic, or anti-perversion drugs. Far from it. But
what they are doing, Your Honour, is leveraging on the side effects
of SSRIs, of these medications, to temporarily cut down the intensity
of these deviant urges until more definitive management can be introduced.
…</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Dr Tan has also testified
that the respondent has responded well to medical and psychological
treatment and has not re-offended since his arrest. The Judge was
of the opinion that incarceration would be detrimental to the rehabilitation
of the respondent and would “destroy the very last hope of… recovery”.
I do not quite agree for the same sentiments expressed by the Court
of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok
Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above). There is similarly no
suggestion here that rehabilitation cannot take place in prison
and continue even after imprisonment. Therefore, even though rehabilitation
is a relevant sentencing principle, it does not automatically mandate
a lighter sentence. However, particular care must be taken when
the global sentence imposed is calibrated such that it is not such
a crushing sentence that may destroy any hope of recovery and reintegration
of the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aggravating and mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I
agree with the prosecution that the factors listed above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> are aggravating
factors. It is trite that the presence of multiple and young victims
are aggravating factors. Prof Andrew Ashworth explains succinctly in
the following passage why planning and premeditation is considered
an aggravating factor (Andrew Ashworth, <em>Sentencing
and Criminal Justice</em> (Cambridge University Press, 5th
Edition, 2010) at p 164):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A person who plans a crime is generally
more culpable, because the offence is premeditated and the offender
is therefore more fully confirmed in his criminal motivation than
someone who acts on impulse, since he is more considered in his
lawbreaking … Planned lawbreaking betokens a considered attack on
social values, with greater commitment and perhaps continuity than
a spontaneous crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The respondent had gone
to great lengths in order to commit these offences. He had to purchase
paraphernalia including mini-cameras and Blu-Tack. He then attached
the camera to his shoe and came up from behind the unsuspecting
victim at “Giant Hypermarket” in order to capture the “Up Skirt”
video. To commit the offences at his girlfriend’s home, he had to
purchase a camera which was cleverly disguised as a lighter to avoid detection.
He would wait for them to switch on the water heater before planting
the camera in the toilet and would later retrieve the camera after they
showered. His commitment to the criminal conduct was demonstrated by
the fact that he did this on more than one occasion and was also
keen on avoiding detection. In fact, he attempted to abscond when
the husband of the victim at Giant Hypermarket shouted at him. The
level of consideration and planning to commit the offences and to
avoid detection is clearly an aggravating factor. The high degree
of intrusion is also aggravating. Not only did the respondent record
some of the victims fully nude with moving images of their breasts
and vulvas, it was done in the victims’ home, where he was a guest
and where the victims would least expect to have their modesty violated.
This conduct constitutes a gross intrusion into the privacy of the
victims and should be given its due weight as an aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As
for the use of a recording device, I have noted earlier that the advancements
in technology warrant a deterrent sentence because of the ease with
which such offences may be committed and the ever present danger
of the dissemination of the videos. The use of a recording device
is an aggravating factor here for a different reason; mainly that
the videos can be replayed and the “fruits” of the criminal conduct
can be constantly revisited by the respondent. This again is clearly
aggravating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The
mitigating factors highlighted by the counsel for the respondent are
listed above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>.
I agree that the lack of antecedents is a mitigating factor. The
fact that the respondent comes from a good family, has a bachelor’s
degree in business management and has put his further education
on hold because of this episode is neither mitigating nor aggravating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I
do not agree that the lack of adverse effects on any of the victims
and the fact that there was no circulation of the videos are mitigating.
While adverse effects on the victims and circulation of the videos
are definitely aggravating, the lack of these factors is not mitigating
but neutral at best. The respondent also relies on the fact that
his girlfriend’s family has been forgiving. The Court of Appeal
in <em>PP v UI</em> has stated that forgiveness expressed
by the victim is a private matter between the offender and the victim
and generally should not affect the appropriate sentence to be imposed
by the court (see <em>PP v UI</em> at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>). Therefore,
I do not consider the forgiving attitude of the respondent’s girlfriend
and her family as mitigating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The
most significant mitigating factor in favour of the respondent is the
remorse that he has shown since the commission of the offences.
The respondent has made a full confession and has cooperated with
the police in the course of their investigations. He has also pleaded
guilty to the charges. I also note that the Judge had stated that
the respondent was suffering from significant depressive and anxiety
symptomatology related to the shame and stress from his commission
of the offences (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above).
While I do not agree with the Judge that this means that there is
no need to punish the respondent further, I am of the opinion that
the degree of shame and stress suffered is indicative of the extent
of the remorse shown by the respondent. Furthermore, the respondent
has shown commendable commitment towards securing his own rehabilitation
by seeking treatment and counselling since his arrest. As the Judge
noted, he had undergone regular treatment for three years since
his arrest and has been responding well to treatment. This is part
of the reason why the respondent has not reoffended since his arrest
(the other reason as noted above was the threat of legal proceedings).
In the light of this, I attach significant weight to the high degree
of remorse shown by the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>Albert Tay</em>, the respondent pleaded guilty
to two charges of intruding upon the privacy of a woman under s
509 of the Penal Code. He placed a video camcorder in his bathroom
to film, on separate occasions, the private moments of two female
colleagues while they used the bathroom. The respondent was convicted
and a fine was imposed for each of the two charges by the magistrate.
The magistrate had referred to the earlier case of <em>Tan
Pin Seng v PP</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Tan
Pin Seng</em>”) where a fine was imposed on an offender who
was convicted of an offence under s 509 of the Penal Code for peeping
at a lady taking a bath through a hole he had made in the bathroom
door. In <em>Tan Pin Seng</em>, Yong CJ had reduced
the one-month jail term imposed by the district court to a fine
of $2000. In <em>Albert Tay</em>, Yong CJ
distinguished his earlier decision of <em>Tan Pin Seng</em> and
allowed the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. In addition to the
fine imposed by the magistrate, Yong CJ sentenced the respondent
to one month’s imprisonment per charge to run consecutively. In
his decision, Yong CJ explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    It
seemed very clear to me that the degree of culpability in the present case
was very much greater than that in <em>Tan Pin
Seng</em>'s case for the peeping offence. In the present case,
there must have been a lot of meticulous planning on the respondent’s
part in order to commit the offences. The respondent had to hide
the video camcorder in the basket of soft toys in the toilet and
then carefully position the lens to point at the toilet door. Furthermore,
the respondent had to switch the video camcorder to recording mode
quickly and discreetly before he allowed each of [B] and [C] to
use the bathroom. Such a <em>modus operandi</em> surely
required more planning and premeditation than peeping through a
hole in the bathroom door.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    I was therefore of the opinion that
the magistrate erred by likening the present situation to that in <em>Tan Pin Seng</em>'s case. I felt that the high
degree of planning needed for the commission of the present offences
rendered the situation here more aggravating than that in <em>Tan Pin Seng</em>'s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Unlike
other “peeping tom” cases where the offender peeps at the victim
in person at one moment in time, the respondent here did not actually observe
[B] and [C] in their private moments in person. He chose to record their
private moments on tape, so that he could watch them again and again for
his own perverted pleasure. The potential for repeated viewings
made the nature of the offences in the present case wholly distinguishable
from that in <em>Tan Pin Seng</em>'s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    … Video camcorders are available freely
in this age of modern technology and policy considerations dictate
that a deterrent sentence has to be imposed to indicate that offences
of this nature will not be tolerated. I cannot send a message to
the public that it is acceptable to make recordings of others without
their knowledge as long as one has the financial resources to pay
a fine. It was fortunate that the video tape in the present case
was discovered by [B]. Should the tape have fallen into the hands
of other third parties, the trauma and embarrassment that the victims
would have had to endure would have been unimaginable. The fact
that a victim's private moments could be recorded without the victim's
knowledge and replayed over and over again for another's perverted
pleasure coupled with the risk of possible circulation of such tapes
to other people compelled me to impose a custodial sentence in this
case to make it clear that the court does not condone such behaviour
or treat it lightly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As was alluded to above,
the court in <em>Albert Tay</em> noted the
need for a deterrent sentence given the ready availability of video
camcorders then. I have already found that the need for a deterrent
sentence is even more pressing today given the advancements in modern
technology. The court was also of the view that a custodial term
was more appropriate given the high degree of planning involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed
Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<em>Liton</em>”),
the respondent was convicted of, <em>inter alia</em>,
a charge of insulting the modesty of a woman under s 509 of the
Penal Code by taking four photographs of her in the nude. The trial
judge had sentenced the respondent to three months’ imprisonment
for that particular charge. In dismissing the appeal against sentence
brought by the Prosecution in respect of that particular charge,
the Court of Appeal noted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    The
authors of <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate
Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) (“<em>Sentencing
Practice</em>”) note (at p 329) that for the offence under
s 509 in general, a fine of $1,000 to $2,000 is the norm: see, for example, <em>Raveendran v PP</em> Magistrate’s Appeal No
125 of 1992 (unreported) and <em>Tan Pin Seng v
PP</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 494 . On the other hand, imprisonment
is appropriate where aggravating factors are present: see <em>Mohd Raus bin Othman v PP</em> Magistrate’s
Appeal No 17 of 1993 (unreported), where the offence was committed
in a lift; <em>Ramakrishnan s/o Ramayan v PP</em> [1998]
3 SLR(R) 161 , where there were multiple charges and the victims
were young; and <em>PP v Johari bin Samad</em> Magistrate’s
Appeal No 69 of 1999 (unreported), where the offender had a previous
conviction for a sexual offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    
              <em>However, more
relevantly for the present case, imprisonment is also appropriate
where the offence was carried out using modern technology to record
a victim’s private moments without her knowledge</em>. In <em>PP v Tay Beng Guan Albert</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R)
778  (“<em>Albert Tay</em>”), it was said
that such an offence differed from other "Peeping Tom" cases as
the recording on a tape could be replayed and there was also a risk
of circulation of the tape to third parties. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">89    Comparing
the previous sentencing precedents with the sentence imposed by
the trial judge, we were of the view that the sentence of three months’
imprisonment was not manifestly inadequate. The facts of the present
case were similar to those in <em>Albert Tay</em> …
in so far as modern technology (the digital camera function of a
mobile telephone in this case) was used to record the complainant’s
private moments. The policy considerations that such recordings
(digital photographs in this case) can be replayed and may be circulated
to third parties were reflected in the trial judge’s imposition
of a term of imprisonment in lieu of the norm of a fine of $1,000
to $2,000. Compared to the one-month imprisonment imposed in <em>Albert Tay</em> for the video recording of
the victim bathing, and bearing in mind the circumscribed manner
in which an appellate court will decide whether or not to interfere
with the sentence imposed by a court of first instance, the three
months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge in the present case could
not be said to be plainly out of line with an <em>established
benchmark</em> so as to be excessively inadequate…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>A few observations are apposite.
The Court of Appeal referred to <em>Albert Tay</em> as
an established benchmark. The Court of Appeal also accepted that imprisonment
is appropriate where the offence was carried out with the use of
modern technology in order to record a victim’s private moments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In <em>Tan Huat Heng</em>, the accused person pleaded
guilty to four charges under s 509 of the Penal Code with four other
charges consented to being taken into consideration for the purpose
of sentencing. The accused had used his camera in his iPhone to
take an “Up Skirt” video of a woman but was spotted by an off-duty
police officer. The victim was apparently unaware of what happened
and had left the scene. The mobile telephone was seized and the
“Up Skirt” video clip was found. Another mobile phone was seized
from the accused and more “Up Skirt” videos were found which formed
the basis for the other charges. The magistrate considered the cases of <em>Albert Tay</em> and <em>Liton</em> and
imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each of the four
proceeded charges and ordered that the sentences for two charges
run consecutively. On appeal to the High Court, Chan Sek Keong CJ
set aside the sentence imposed by the magistrate and imposed a 12-month
term of probation with certain conditions. However, no written grounds
were issued by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Counsel
for the respondent argues that <em>Tan Huat Heng</em> has
signalled a change in the sentencing philosophy when it comes to
offences under s 509 of the Penal Code. I do not agree. There was
no evidence of a high degree of planning and premeditation in <em>Tan Huat Heng</em>. Furthermore, the videos did
not involve the same degree of intrusion into the privacy of the
victim as compared to <em>Albert Tay</em> and <em>Liton</em> where the victims were captured
fully naked. The aggravating factors present in <em>Albert
Tay</em> and <em>Liton</em> were absent in <em>Tan Huat Heng</em> which may explain why the
court imposed a term of probation and not a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     On
the other hand, the Prosecution submits that the starting point
for offences under s 509 of the Penal Code involving the use of
a recording device should be a custodial sentence. I am of the opinion
that establishing a custodial benchmark along such lines may not
be appropriate given the myriad of ways that offences under s 509
of the Penal Code may be committed with a recording device. <em>Albert Tay</em> involved planning and premeditation
in the commission of the offence. Both <em>Albert
Tay</em> and <em>Liton</em> had a high
degree of intrusion into the privacy of the victim. While I am generally
in agreement that a custodial sentence is warranted where the aggravating
factors such as multiple victims or young victims or the aggravating
factors in <em>Albert Tay</em> or <em>Liton</em> are present, I would be chary in concluding
that a custodial sentence should be the starting point the moment
a recording device is used. While I note that the use of a recording device
allows the repeated viewing of the victim’s private moments, all other
factors should be considered before the final sentence is calibrated. Therefore,
where there is no planning and premeditation and the intrusion upon
the privacy is not as grave as in <em>Albert Tay</em> and <em>Liton</em>, and where multiple victims or young
victims are not involved, such as in <em>Tan Huat Heng</em>,
a custodial term may not be warranted. At the end of the day, each
set of facts must be considered as a whole by the judge in determining
the appropriate sentence to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     On
the facts of the present case, due to the presence of the aggravating factors
mentioned above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>,
especially the fact that (a) there was a high degree of planning
and premeditation; (b) the intrusion into the privacy of some victims
was grave and at the home of the victims; (c) there were multiple
victims and young victims; and (d) a miniature recording device was
used,  and given that the need for general deterrence is greater
now than before due to the advancements in technology (see above
at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>),
I am of the opinion that a term of four months’ imprisonment (which
is approximately 18 weeks’ imprisonment) per charge under s 509
of the Penal Code is appropriate. However, because of the mitigating
facts (see above at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>)
and in particular the fact that he had pleaded guilty and has shown
considerable remorse with a keen desire not to commit the offences again
and to be fully rehabilitated, I impose a sentence of <b><u>12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge</u></b>. I
now deal with the conviction under s 30(1) of the Films Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In <em>Lui Chang Soon v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992]
1 SLR(R) 229, the appellant pleaded guilty to, <em>inter
alia</em>, one charge of possession of 14 obscene videotapes
under s 29(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Films Act
(Cap 107, 1985 Rev Ed). The magistrate had sentenced the appellant
to a fine of $500 per tape ($7000 fine in total). The High Court
dismissed the appeal against sentence in respect of above charge.
The High Court also found that punishment should be related to the
number of films involved and not the number of tapes containing
the films.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The
following passage from <em>Practitioners’ Library</em>: <em>Sentencing Principles in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis,
3rd Ed, 2013) at page 627–628 is useful:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The primary concern in sentencing is the
protection of the public from moral corruption, and in particular
young persons who may be tempted to view such films. As pointed
out by the Minister for Information and the Arts in moving the Films
(Amendment) Bill in Parliament, a disturbing trend in these offences
is the proliferation of sale in public places. Examples cited were the
incidences of flyers being stuffed into HDB letterboxes offering pornographic
video tapes for sale to residents; and uncensored and obscene VCDs
sold at pasar malams, trade fairs and other places. Technological advances
have made the production of such films relatively cheap. The illegal profits
are very high. Detection and apprehension, on the other hand, is
(<em>sic</em>) difficult as such operators
usually operate from make-shift stalls or through pager/mobile phone
contacts. Even after raids, the sellers would sometimes return the
next day, selling the same obscene VCDs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The type and quantum of the sentence would
depend on the circumstances. In particular, the quality, nature
and quantity of the films would be relevant. The issue of whether
there is any commercial gain should also be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A non-custodial sentence is reserved for
isolated offences where the number of films is small (usually less
than 20), they are for personal use, where there is no commercial
element, and the accused (a first offender) has pleaded guilty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where there is evidence of commercial exploitation,
a custodial sentence can be expected. In such cases, the prosecution
usually prefers a charge of carrying on a business of distributing
films without a licence in contravention of s 6(1)(<em>a</em>)
in addition to the charge of distributing or having possession for the
purposes of distributing in contravention of s 29(3)(<em>a</em>). In cases where obscene VCD inlays
are exhibited for purposes of advertisement, another charge under
s 292(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Penal Code is
also usually preferred. The length of the custodial sentence will
depend on the scale of the operation, the quantity and nature of
the films, whether there has been a plea of guilt coupled with co-operation
in the investigation or a contested case, and the character of the
offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Hiap Hua</em> [2010]
SGDC 322 (“<em>Tan Hiap Hua</em>”), the accused
pleaded guilty to a single charge of possession of 38 obscene films
under s 30(1) of the Films Act. The 38 obscene films were found
in his mobile phone. In sentencing the accused to three months’ imprisonment,
the district judge noted that the number of films was large and
that it was “certainly unusual to store 38 obscene films in a handphone for
private viewing”. The district judge also considered that the long
list of antecedents of the accused including offences of possession
of obscene films for which he was sentenced to five years of corrective
training. On appeal, V K Rajah JA allowed the appeal against sentence
and reduced the sentence to one of six weeks’ imprisonment. No written
grounds were issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Yang Qiuyu</em> [2010]
SGDC 51, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge of possession
of 204 digital video discs containing 179 films without a valid
certificate approving the exhibition of the films under s 21(1)(<em>a</em>) and one charge of possession of 96
films which were obscene under s 30(1) of the Films Act. The accused
had various antecedents including a conviction under s 29(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Films Act (for distributing
obscene films or having them in possession for the purposes of distributing).
In sentencing the accused to the minimum specified penalty of $100
for each film without a valid certificate ($17,900 in total) and
$500 for possession of each obscene film (amounting to $20,000 as
capped by law), the court noted that the number of films was certainly
not on a small or low scale and that a custodial sentence for the
offence under s 30(1) of the Films Act would ordinarily be meted
out. Nevertheless, the court was minded not to impose a custodial
sentence as the obscene DVDs “were not on display blatantly but
contained in a haversack”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Hanafi Bin Abdol Hamid</em> [2007] SGDC
247, the accused, who was a police officer, had pleaded guilty to
four charges including one charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act
for possession of two digital discs containing two obscene films
and one charge under s 30(2)(<em>a</em>)
of the Films Act for possession of nine films known by him to be obscene.
The district judge noted that the number of films involved was small
and that a fine would be appropriate in the circumstances. The sentenced
imposed was the minimum specified sentence of $500 per film ($1000
in total) under s 30(1) and $1000 per film ($9000 in total) under
s 30(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Films Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Finally,
in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Chandran
s/o Natesan</em> [2013] SGDC 33, the accused pleaded guilty
to various charges including one charge of possession of 291 obscene
films under s 30(1) of the Films Act. Initially, the accused was
found suitable for a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) and thus
ordered to undergo a MTO for psychiatric treatment for one year.
However, the MTO was revoked by the district judge who found that
the accused had breached the requirement of attending before the
IMH doctor as required under the MTO and that the accused was not
compliant with his medication. The district judge then considered
the accused’s delusional disorder, his plea of guilt and discounted
his antecedents as they were dated and not of a similar nature, before
sentencing the accused to a $500 fine per film (capped at $20000). The
sentences for all the other offences were fines as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In
the instance case, it is unclear from the statement of facts, whether the
10,574 obscene films were merely short video clips or full-length obscene
movies. The fact that they were all on his computer and hard drive suggests
to me that they were more likely to be short video clips as I doubt that
10,574 full-length obscene movies could be stored on the computer hard
disk and one external hard drive. Having 10,574 short obscene video clips
would be much less serious than having the same number of full-length
obscene films.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Giving
the respondent the benefit of the doubt that they were all short video
clips and taking into account his plea of guilt, the extent of the remorse
that he has shown and the fact that he did not exploit them for
any commercial gain, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence
for the charge under s 30(1) of the Films Act is an <b><u>imprisonment term of four weeks</u></b>. A fine
would not be adequate because of the very large number of video
clips involved.  If the respondent had not pleaded guilty and shown the
degree of remorse that he did, a stiffer custodial sentence of six
weeks’ imprisonment would have been meted out. It may be pertinent
to note here that had I sentenced the respondent to a fine for this
charge under the Films Act instead of a term of imprisonment, the
respondent would be worse off as his total imprisonment sentence
would be much higher as I would have no alternative but to order,
pursuant to s 307 of the CPC, that at least two sentences for the
offences under s 509 of the Penal Code to run consecutively (see <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> below). These
are heavier imprisonment sentences than the sentence I have imposed
for the Films Act offence. On top of the extended global term of
imprisonment, the respondent would also have to pay a fine, which
would not have been insubstantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I
also note that the accused in <em>Tan Hiap Hua</em> had
been sentenced to an imprisonment term of six weeks for possession
of 38 obscene films. However, the accused in <em>Tan
Hiap Hua</em> had been previously convicted of offences of
possession of obscene films for which he was sentenced to five years
of corrective training. The respondent here had no such related antecedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Having
decided that the appropriate sentence for the each of the offences
under s 509 of the Penal Code and s 30(1) of the Films Act is 12 weeks
and four weeks respectively, I now consider which sentences should run
consecutively. I am bound to order at least two terms of imprisonment to
run consecutively pursuant to s 307 of the CPC. In <em>Mohamed
Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2014] 2 SLR 998,
Sundaresh Menon CJ explained that the “sentencing judge is vested
with considerable discretion, but this must be exercised judiciously
and with regard to two principles in particular, namely, the one-transaction
rule and the totality principle, as well as a number of ancillary
principles” (at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>).
In this case, I am of the view that there is no need to order more
than two sentences to run consecutively, or to order two sentences
under s 509 to run consecutively, which would then have raised the
total sentence to 24 weeks. I therefore order that one charge under
s 509 of the Penal Code (namely MCN 686 of 2012) and one charge
under s 30(1) of the Films Act (namely MCN 692 of 2012) are to run
consecutively. The remaining sentences will run concurrently. The
global sentence imposed on the respondent is a <b><u>term
of imprisonment of 16 weeks</u></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentence is wrong in law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Finally,
I also note that both the Prosecution and the respondent have submitted
in the court below that the punishment prescribed under s 30(1) of
the Films Act is not one which is fixed by law, nor a mandatory minimum
sentence or a specified minimum sentence. However, this was before
the case of <em>Mohamad Fairuuz bin Saleh v Public
Prosecutor</em> [2015] 1 SLR 1145 (“<em>Fairuuz</em>”)
where the High Court explained the proper interpretation of those
phrases as they appear in s 5 of the Probation of Offenders Act
(Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed) (“POA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 5 of the POA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Probation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5.</b>—(1)
Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not
being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the
opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature
of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient
to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation
order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision
of a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period
to be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more
than 3 years:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that where a person is convicted
of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory
minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed
by law, the court may make a probation order if the person —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    has attained the age of
16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of
his conviction; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    has
not been previously convicted of any such offence referred to in
this proviso, and for this purpose section 11(1) shall not apply
to any such previous conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In <em>Fairuuz</em>,
Menon CJ explained the proper interpretation of s 5 of the POA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    In
summary, pursuant to the opening paragraph of s 5(1) of the POA (which
we shall refer to as the principal part of s 5(1)), where an accused person
is convicted of an offence which is punishable by a sentence that
is fixed by law, probation is generally not available as a sentencing
option for the court. However, pursuant to the Proviso, where a
person is convicted of an offence for which <em>a
specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence</em> is
prescribed, probation may be ordered if the two conditions in the Proviso
as encapsulated in subsection (a) and (b) are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Having
carefully considered the various arguments in the round, we concluded
that the terms “sentence fixed by law”, “mandatory minimum sentence”
and “specified minimum sentence” carry the following meanings:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    A
“mandatory minimum sentence” means a sentence where a minimum quantum
for a particular type of sentence is prescribed, and the imposition
of that type of sentence is mandatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    A “specified minimum sentence” means
a sentence where a minimum quantum for a particular type of sentence
is prescribed, but the imposition of that type of sentence is not
mandatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    A sentence “fixed by law” is one where
the court has absolutely no discretion as to the type of sentence
(which is mandatory) and the quantum of the prescribed punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     At
this juncture it would be useful to set out s 30(1) of the Films
Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>30.</b>—(1)
Any person who has in his possession any obscene film shall be guilty
of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not
less than $500 for each such film he had in his possession (but
not to exceed in the aggregate $20,000) or to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding 6 months or to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In my opinion, s 30(1) of
the Films Act has a specified minimum sentence. The court when sentencing
under s 30(1) of the Films Act has the discretion to choose between
a fine, a term of imprisonment or both. Thus, the imposition of
a fine is not mandatory but if the court does choose to impose a
fine, there is a minimum quantum of $500 which is prescribed and
which must be imposed by the court. Therefore, probation can only
be ordered if the two conditions encapsulated in subsections (a)
and (b) of s 5 of the POA are satisfied. The respondent in this
case was 29 years old at the time of his conviction. He has therefore
not satisfied subsection (a) of s 5 of the POA and probation is
not available as a sentencing option. In this regard, the sentence
imposed by the Judge was also a sentence which was wrong in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     This
leads to a final question of whether probation is nevertheless available
as a sentencing option for the respondent for the other five charges
under s 509 of the Penal Code. This pertains to a more general question
– if a person is convicted of multiple charges in which one of the offences
does not allow for probation as a sentencing option, can the court nevertheless
order probation for the rest of the convictions where probation is
available. However, since I have not had the benefit of argument
on this issue and I have found that a sentence of probation for
the charges under s 509 of the Penal Code is manifestly inadequate
in this case, I leave the question open for reconsideration at a
more appropriate juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In
sum, I allow the prosecution’s appeal against sentence. The sentence
of probation meted out by the Judge is manifestly inadequate. I substitute
the sentence of probation with a term of imprisonment of 16 weeks.</p>
