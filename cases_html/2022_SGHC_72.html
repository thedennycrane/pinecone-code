</div> According to David, he had discussed with one Aloysius Tan (“Aloysius”) about Aloysius acquiring a 50% shareholding in GWL. Around 19 December 2016, Irene joined GWL as a director and David transferred 50% of his shares to her. Irene contributed $30,000 in cash to GWL. Her contribution came from Aloysius, who was her former husband, and she held her 50% shareholding on his behalf.

Subsequently, 34 more cars were acquired by GWL with funds from entities related to Aloysius or one Andrew Sim (“Andrew”) used to purchase some of these cars. Whether GWL beneficially owned these 34 cars was a point of contention between the parties. Hence, GWL had 38 cars (collectively “the Cars”) under its name, although by October 2017 all the Cars had been transferred out of GWL.

Some of these cars would have their Certificates of Entitlement renewed and be re-sold at a profit with the sale proceeds to be re-invested in acquiring more cars at scrap value.

First, Irene had caused GWL to transfer the Cars which belonged to GWL to unknown persons without his knowledge or approval such that GWL had no cars left by October 2017. Despite GWL being profitable, Irene refused to declare a fair share of dividends to David, and she had misappropriated the profits from the sale of the Cars.

</div> Second, Irene had caused moneys to be withdrawn from GWL’s bank account without his knowledge and consent on at least 78 occasions (“the Transactions”). Third, she had caused GWL to make payments that it did not legitimately incur for her own benefit, on four occasions (“the Payments”). Fourth, she attempted to conceal her wrongdoing and fraud by submitting inaccurate accounts of GWL’s records to him and denying him access to inspect the records.

Negotiations for her joint venture business with David were done by Andrew on her behalf and culminated in the following agreement. GWL would acquire cars to be leased out, with David and her contributing the initial capital as at [2] above, and they would provide further funds to buy another 50 cars. Additionally, Global Garage Pte Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">GG</span>”) (incorporated in 2014 with Andrew, Wang Pinying (David’s friend) and David as shareholders) would service and repair GWL’s cars. Finally, all profits and losses of GWL and GG would be shared or borne equally between the parties. Irene joined GWL around 19 December 2016 on Aloysius’s request and she did not know David prior to this.

Section 216 of the CA encapsulates four limbs, namely oppression, disregard of a shareholder’s interests, unfair discrimination and prejudice. The common element supporting these limbs is commercial unfairness, which is found where there has been a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing which a shareholder is entitled to expect. In assessing if there has been commercial unfairness, the court should determine if there has been a departure from the commercial agreement between the shareholders as found in the formal constitutional documents of the company, informal understandings, or, in a quasi-partnership, the legitimate expectations of shareholders (<span class="font-italic">Ascend Field Pte Ltd and others v Tee Wee Sien and another appeal</span> [2020] 1 SLR 771 at [28]–[29]). In particular, diversion of a company’s business without adequate justification, or the favouring by a majority shareholder of another company to the detriment of the company in which a minority has his shareholding, can amount to oppressive conduct under s 216 of the CA (<span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin (on behalf of himself and as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd) v Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 4 SLR 331 at [67]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">others </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Where there is a quasi-partnership, the court will apply a stricter yardstick of scrutiny. In such situations, minority shareholders are particularly vulnerable because of the informal nature of the company set-up where not all rights and obligations are explicitly spelt out in legal terms. The minority shareholders could be vulnerable to the exploitative conduct by the majority as the former may have no obvious legal remedies spelt out in the memorandum and articles of association (<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 776 at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ initial agreement concerning the operation of GWL</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I first deal with the incorporation of GWL and the terms of agreement which Irene claimed applied to the joint venture with David in GWL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 David had known Aloysius and Andrew prior to Irene becoming a shareholder of GWL.

</div> Although David had incorporated GWL in November 2016 before Irene/Aloysius became a shareholder in December 2016, the parties had in November 2016 made arrangements on how they would contribute an equal amount of capital for GWL to acquire the first four cars for its business (see [19] below). GWL was managed in an informal manner, with the common understanding that the daily management would be left to Irene as David was occupied with his full-time job at Carlsberg.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I thus find that GWL was founded and continued on the basis of mutual trust and confidence when Aloysius became a shareholder, given his friendship with David and their plan to venture into the car-leasing business because of its potential profitability. Hence, David was content to leave the management of GWL to Irene, who operated the business in an informal manner. David and Irene (Aloysius) treated GWL as a quasi-partnership even if Irene (holding her shares on Aloysius’ behalf) joined GWL after its incorporation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Capital contribution and first four cars</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I accept that Aloysius (through Irene) acquired a 50% shareholding in GWL based on his $30,000 capital contribution. It was not disputed that David’s $30,000 contribution comprised about $13,000 in cash and his car 4417. On 23 November 2016, David transferred $16,000 into GWL’s account. He also handed $14,000 to Aloysius to settle the outstanding loan on his car and, on 23 November 2016, JAI transferred $14,000 to GWL. The following day, $17,439.83 was used to pay off the loan on car 4417. The transactions are reflected in GWL’s bank statements and recorded in Irene’s journal entries (at the Plaintiff’s Core Bundle pages 1 to 20, collectively called “Irene’s Journal”). Car 4417 was transferred to and registered in GWL on 28 November 2016. As for Aloysius’s capital contribution, GWL received the moneys from JAI on 25 November and 19 December 2016.

Likewise, car 3174, although purchased by GWL, was paid for by GC. Again, David confirmed that he was no longer claiming that car 3174 was beneficially owned by GWL.

There was nothing to suggest that his consent was required for them, if they were largely to do with GWL’s operating expenses, as he was content to leave the daily management of GWL to Irene who was also a director. This is even if he expected to be kept informed of GWL’s business dealings and performance as there was no evidence that he had requested for periodic updates on GWL’s business much less that Irene had refused to update him when he asked. The issue is whether the Transactions or Payments were legitimate in nature. In this regard, Irene was managing GWL solely and had access to the documents and records, while David was not an active director. Therefore, to the extent that David can show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that raises suspicion as to the validity of the Transactions or Payments, the evidential burden shifts to Irene to produce the relevant documents to show they were legitimate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In court, David conceded that apart from items 11, 12, 16, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, 29 to 32, 34, 40, 41, 45, 48 to 52, 54, 55, 57 to 59, 61 to 63, and 65 to 78, he was no longer challenging the rest of the Transactions.

Irene stated that David was at the material time informed that GWL was paying rent. However, the rent increased to $2,000 per month from March 2017 as GWL had moved to the Premier in order to increase its fleet of cars. At the Premier, GA rented two units from the landlord at over $4,000 per unit, and then leased one of the units to GWL and GC, with GA occupying the other unit.

</div> Hence, it was justifiable to attribute at best half of the $291.82 as GWL’s expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Turning to the Broadband Bill, again this was billed to GF and which remained unpaid from mid-October 2016 to February 2017. I find this Bill should not have been attributed to GWL. In relation to an accumulated amount of $219.94 owing from mid-October to November 2016, GWL was not in existence then. As for the amounts from mid-January 2017, Irene accepted that GWL had moved to the Premier and the broadband charges were for the premises at KB Ave 6.

Irene did not explain how much was still owed by GWL to GC (or CA) as of 5 or 6 October 2017. Furthermore, Irene’s basis for transferring $107,000 to GC was that the Nine Cars belonged to GC and/or CA. However, I had earlier found that cars 3487, 2574, 3396, 6915 beneficially belonged to GWL, and Irene did not dispute that car 4417 was one of the initial four cars. Nevertheless, David conceded that four of the Nine Cars (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cars 6396, 3625, 3382 and 3572) beneficially belonged to GC and that any proceeds from the disposal of these cars (which totalled $52,000) would also belong to GC (see [63] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 That being the case, I am satisfied that Irene should not have caused the remainder of $55,000 to be transferred from GWL to GC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Denial of access to GWL’s records and concealment of wrongdoing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Finally, David pleaded that Irene had attempted to conceal her wrongdoing and fraud by submitting inaccurate accounts of GWL’s books and records (“GWL’s records”) to David and denied him the right to inspect GWL’s records. David stated that by January 2018, he started to chase Irene for GWL’s accounts as he expected a fair return on his business investment in GWL; this was after disagreements and tensions had arisen around mid-2017 with Aloysius regarding the management of GG. Irene however refused to provide him with GWL’s records and told him that the accounts would be prepared by GWL’s accountant, Prima Management Services Pte Ltd (“Prima”). David then made enquiries to Prima regarding GWL’s accounts which Prima subsequently prepared, and Prima provided David a summary of the profit and expenses for cars 6302, 3487, 8931 and 4417 (“4 Cars”) with a brief statement that GG had suffered losses which were to be set off against any profits made by GWL. At that point, David was shocked as there was no prior agreement that the accounts for GWL and GG would be linked or that the profits and losses of both entities would be accounted for together.

</div> If so, there was no reason why she could not have acceded to David’s request for disclosure, particularly when she received the 2019 Demand Letter.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Irene’s conduct thus showed that she had sought to conceal material information from David pertaining to how GWL’s business had been run and its financial position. Her actions must be seen in the light that David was unaware of the number of cars registered under GWL at the material times and of GWL’s disposal of all the Cars until after the fact. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether a claim under s 216 of the CA is made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 There is no requirement for the plaintiff to be a minority shareholder to bring a claim under s 216 of the CA. The key question is whether the member lacks the power to stop the allegedly oppressive acts (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>”) at [48]). In <span class="font-italic">Neil John Ryan v Exploration Png (S) Pte Ltd and Another</span> [2000] SGHC 242 at [15] and [19], the court held that a claim under s 216 of the CA may be brought even where both parties hold equal shares in the company. Whilst David was a 50% shareholder in GWL, he was not in control of the affairs of the company such that he cannot allege that he could have been oppressed (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span> at [49]). Any disagreement between him and Irene on GWL’s management would have resulted in a deadlock. Hence, David is entitled to seek relief under s 216.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Next, it would not be easy for a shareholder who bases his oppression action on allegations of mismanagement to meet the requisite threshold for establishing oppression, unless there was also a self-serving aspect to the mismanagement in question (<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 at [151]). However, in the present case, Irene’s acts were not mere mismanagement. They were intended to benefit her or Related Entities, to deplete GWL’s assets and finances and ultimately the value of David’s shareholding, and to reduce the returns that David would obtain from his investment in GWL. I find that this amounted to a personal wrong against David. Irene had conducted GWL’s affairs in a manner oppressive to David, and in disregard of and prejudiced his interests as a shareholder. Her conduct, seen in totality, had been commercially unfair to David and contrary to his legitimate expectation as a shareholder that Irene would act in GWL’s best interest and not use GWL to further her interest or the interest of other parties. I am thus satisfied that David’s claim under s 216 of the CA has been made out. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In managing GWL’s business, Irene charged various expenses to GWL without justification. In March 2017, she charged phone and broadband expenses to GWL when she clearly knew there was no justification for so doing.  The Phone Bill and Broadband Bill, which were addressed to GF, had remained unpaid for many months before they were suddenly attributed as GWL’s expenses. As Mr Seah revealed in court, Irene had an interest in GF. She also allowed Aloysius to keep a sum of $300 which belonged to GWL and caused GWL to pay commission to Andrew without justification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Then, in August and October 2017 (after disputes arose between David and Aloysius), Irene caused some $25,000, $6,000 and $107,000 to be transferred from GWL to GC purportedly as repayment of loans but which I have found were largely unsubstantiated (see [124]–[128] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Additionally, Irene unilaterally determined and paid herself $1,600 (around 9 October 2017) and caused GWL to pay a “salary” to Andrew of $1,440 (on 5 October 2017) although Andrew was not GWL’s employee. I agree with Mr Lim that the timing of Irene’s withdrawals of these sums, which were on or shortly after the last nine (out of 10) cars from GWL had been disposed of and a sum of $107,000 had been transferred from GWL to GC (being the sale proceeds for the Nine Cars), was effectively to reduce GWL’s cash balance and ultimately the value of David’s shares in GWL. This is also in light of the fact that the withdrawal of $1,600 by Irene, which was to enrich herself, was made without informing David. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As for the Cars registered in GWL’s name, Irene had treated them as GC’s and/or CA’s cars and sought to dispose of all of them in agreement with Aloysius and Andrew and without David’s knowledge. In particular, a substantial number of cars that belonged to GWL beneficially were transferred out (to GC) for no consideration. Pertinently, when nine of the last 10 cars were disposed of in October 2017, Irene had caused all the sale proceeds of the Nine Cars received by GWL to be paid to GC the very next day. Irene’s claim that the $107,000 sale proceeds belonged to GC and/or CA as the Nine Cars were beneficially owned by them was inconsistent with her admission and treatment of at least two cars (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cars 4417 and 3487) which she stated belonged to GWL. I reiterate my findings at [68] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Even if some of the Cars belonged to GC (which David subsequently conceded there were 12), Irene had allowed them to be placed under GWL’s business to generate revenue which she then claimed belonged to GC and/or CA. If so, she had allowed GC, CA, Aloysius or Andrew to utilise GWL’s resources (such as staff and premises) for GC and/or CA’s business, given it was unclear how much of the revenue generated from the cars (which Irene and Andrew claimed belonged to GC or CA) were actually used to defray GWL’s operating expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Subsequently, Irene sought to attribute only four cars (the 4 Cars) as belonging to GWL and then sought to set off whatever profits generated from the 4 Cars against all the losses of GG, in reliance on the Purported Terms which I have found were never agreed upon. In effect, her action in this regard and the manner of accounting was an attempt to reduce the value of David’s shareholding and returns in GWL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The bulk of moneys and/or assets of GWL that were transferred from GWL took place when David and Aloysius’ relationship started to deteriorate. Hence, when David asked Irene for GWL’s records to verify its transactions, Irene had deliberately withheld them even when she had the documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Irene’s conduct, seen in totality, showed that she had failed to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of GWL and to safeguard GWL’s interests. Indeed, she caused many of the above to occur on the instructions of Aloysius, whom I find played an active role behind the scenes. Irene admitted that Aloysius either made decisions for GWL or that she made decisions for GWL pursuant to Aloysius’ instructions. This included expanding the fleet of cars in GWL and the subsequent disposal of all the Cars.

The failure to declare dividends does not in itself amount to unfair conduct under s 216 of the CA, as a company generally has no obligation to declare dividends and shareholders correspondingly have no right to receive them (<span class="font-italic">Burland v Earle</span> [1902] AC 83 at 95; <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah and others v Lim Boh Yong and others and other matters</span> [2015] 5 SLR 307 at [145]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 David has prayed that Irene be ordered to purchase his shares in GWL without a discount and at a fair value to be determined by the court, or alternatively that GWL be wound up pursuant to s 254 of the CA. Mr Lim submitted that as Irene had effectively dissipated GWL’s assets causing it to be nothing more than an empty shell with no viable ongoing business or assets, the more appropriate order would be for her to buy out David’s shares taking into account the acts of oppression committed.

</div> Irene, on the other hand, made no submissions whatsoever on the appropriate remedy in the event that the court finds there to be oppression – Mr Seah’s closing submissions (which dealt with the issue of liability) amounted to no more than four pages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In determining the appropriate remedy under s 216 of the CA, the court has the unfettered discretion to make such order is it thinks appropriate with the view “to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of”. A winding up should only be ordered if, having taken into account all the circumstances of the case, it is the best solution for all the parties involved (<span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In this case, I agree with Mr Lim that it would be more appropriate to order Irene to buy out David’s shares in GWL at a fair value. A winding up of GWL would not bring to an end or remedy the matters complained of, particularly when various sums of moneys have been wrongfully transferred out to GC and the Cars have been disposed of (such as by transfer to GC or sale to CarTimes). Whilst GWL is hardly operational, this is not a case in which it would be difficult to value its shares, given that the leasing business was conducted for only about a year before all the Cars were disposed of and that GWL was not a large entity with extensive assets. Further, the disputed payments which Irene caused GWL to make were identified and the court has made a determination on them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I thus order that an independent valuer be appointed to determine the value of David’s 50% shares in GWL, and the valuation should take into account the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the value of the cars that I have found to be beneficially owned by GWL (totalling 26 cars), and where the cars were sold the value of the sale proceeds should be considered as GWL’s assets for the purposes of valuation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) all the moneys that had been paid out without proper basis (based on my findings above) should be considered as GWL’s assets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) any moneys owed by GWL should be considered as GWL’s liability which has to be repaid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I will hear parties on the exact form of the orders to be made arising out of my decision, including the method of appointing a valuer and the date the shares should be valued at. I will also hear the parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Audrey Lim J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Jun Hao Alvin (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Seah Choon Huat Johnny (Seah &amp; Co) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">second defendant unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
