</div> When Yati subsequently called the accused to break up with him after they had parted ways on 23 December 2018, the accused was infuriated and once again resolved to kill her. In persuading her to meet him for a final time at the Hotel on 30 December 2018, the accused had intended to kill her if she refused to end her relationship with Hanifa.

Firstly, it was saying that the Prosecution had failed to prove the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> required for an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) – namely, the intention of causing Yati’s death. This was why the Defence’s submissions concluded with the suggestion that the accused should be convicted of an offence under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) instead – which would have entailed a finding that the accused’s intention was only to cause bodily injury to Yati. Secondly, in saying that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”, the Defence was also contending that the accused’s killing of Yati was not carried out in accordance with a “premeditated plan”.

In considering this argument, it was important to bear in mind the physical acts which were carried out by the accused against Yati in the moments leading up to her death.  These were described by the accused in the investigative statements recorded by the police.  I noted of course that at trial, the accused disavowed all references in the investigative statements to any “decision” or “plan” on his part to kill Yati.  However, even shorn of these references, the accused’s description of the physical acts <span class="font-italic">per se</span> was in my view highly instructive as to his intention in carrying out these acts.  In gist, he described two separate acts of strangulation: the strangulation performed with a towel, followed by the strangulation using the rope which had been inside his trouser pocket.  In addition to (and subsequent to) the two acts of strangulation, he also described how he had pressed down on Yati’s nose and mouth using a towel, and finally, how he had twisted her head from left to right.  He also described the steps he took in carrying out each of these acts and the degree of force he employed.  I set out below the passages from his statements in which the various physical acts were described, starting with the strangulation using the towel:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From the accused’s investigative statement of 4 January 2019:

What he did dispute in cross-examination was, firstly, the number of times he had placed the towel around Yati’s neck before finally strangling her: in his statements, he described the strangulation as having taken place on the third occasion when he had placed the towel around her neck; in cross-examination, he claimed that he had placed the towel around her neck a total of four times and that he had only tightened the towel on the fourth occasion.

</div> In addition, he denied that he had committed the subsequent acts of strangulation with the rope, pressing on Yati’s mouth and nose, and twisting of her head because he thought that she was not yet dead and wanted to ensure that she would not survive: according to his oral testimony, by the time he came to use the rope, he already “thought she had died”.

In my view, the number, the nature and the sequence of these physical acts clearly demonstrated an intention to cause Yati’s death.  To put it bluntly, the accused visited multiple, successive acts of violence on Yati within a short span of time. This was not, moreover, a case of mere slaps or punches: he strangled her twice using two different implements, pressed down hard on her mouth and nose (“a force of 10, out of the spectrum 10”), and twisted her head from left to right.  He could not have intended anything else other than her death.            </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49      It should also be pointed out that although in his interviews with Dr Ung the accused denied having formed any plan to kill Yati prior to 30 December 2018, Dr Ung’s notes of the interview on 19 May 2020 recorded the accused as having said that he had “decided to kill [Yati] on 3rd time of strangling (on 30th December 2018)”.

</div>  At trial, the Defence did not challenge the accuracy of this portion of Dr Ung’s notes. That the accused himself had admitted to having “decided to kill [Yati] on 3rd time of strangling (on 30th December 2018)” further supported the inference that his intention at the time of carrying out the physical acts of strangulation was to cause Yati’s death.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the reasons set out in [44]–[49], I was satisfied that the accused’s intention at the material time was to cause death.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the accused’s killing of Yati was carried out in accordance with a “premeditated plan”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In submitting that the accused “did not intend to kill [Yati]”, the Defence’s other contention was that the killing was not carried out in accordance with a premeditated plan.  According to the accused, he had merely “thought” about killing Yati prior to 30 December 2018 but had not formulated any real plan nor come to a firm decision to do so. Instead, he had simply lost all self-control and acted impulsively on 30 December 2018 upon hearing Yati utter the Humiliating Words to him in the Room. This version of events – as presented to Dr Ung and at trial – turned on two key factual propositions: firstly, that various statements documented in the accused’s police statements and in his interviews with Dr Cheok could not be relied on because he had never made those statements; and secondly, that the Humiliating Words had indeed been spoken by Yati to the accused on 30 December 2018.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the accused told the police in his investigative statements that he had decided to kill Yati     </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I address first the accused’s claims about the statements recorded from him by the police.

</div> On 7 January 2019, the accused had also made amendments to the investigative statement recorded from him that day.  Thus, for example, the handwritten amendments at paragraph 98 of the statement of 7 January 2019 showed that the accused had volunteered additional details about how he had noticed blood stains on the towel – but not blood coming out from Yati – at the point when he started putting her clothing on her body and positioning her body on the bed.

In addition to being given the opportunity at the end of the recording of each statement to make amendments to that statement, the statement-recording on 4 January 2019 and on 7 January 2019 was preceded by Hasan reading back and interpreting to the accused the statement(s) recorded in the previous session(s), and ASP Teo asking the accused (through Hasan) if he wished to make any amendments to the previous statement(s).  This meant that on 4 January 2019, before any statement was recorded from the accused, the statement of 3 January 2019 was read back and interpreted to him; and he was asked if he wished to make any “correction, deletion or addition to it”.  Similarly, on 7 January 2019, before any statement was recorded from the accused, the statements of 3 January 2019 and 4 January 2019 were read back and interpreted to him; and he was asked if he wished to make any “correction, deletion or addition” to those statements.

Basically, when I could not talk to her, I felt very angry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It should be added that Hasan testified that the accused raised no complaints in the course of the recording of his statements.  Certainly he did not complain that he could not understand Hasan or that Hasan had misinterpreted parts of his statements.  Hasan’s testimony in this respect was not challenged by the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I found it telling that the accused had his statements read back to him several times, that he was presented with multiple opportunities to amend those statements, and that he did make amendments (including substantive amendments).  It raised serious questions as to why the accused did nothing about those parts of the statements in which he was recorded as saying he had “decided” to kill Yati.  Even more tellingly, when pressed to clarify exactly what he had said to Hasan and how Hasan had interpreted his statement back to him, the accused’s evidence became increasingly incoherent and unbelievable.  I take paragraph 20 of the accused’s statement of 3 January 2019 as an example.  In examination-in-chief, although he started by claiming that he had told Hasan he was “thinking” about what to do and whether to kill Yati, he shifted after a while to claiming that “[t]hese words came from … Hasan”.

When it was pointed out to him that he had managed to make multiple amendments to the statement of 3 January 2019 and even to paragraph 20 itself, the accused’s testimony shifted again: he claimed that “[s]ometimes [he] heard [Hasan], sometimes [he] did not”; that “[s]ometimes [he] felt like talking, sometimes [he] didn’t feel like talking”;

</div> the accused was referred to Question 5 in his statement of 4 January 2019, in which ASP Teo had focused specifically on the sentence in paragraph 20 of his 3 January 2019 statement, “On 9 December 2018, when she (‘Yati’) first told me that she had another  boyfriend, I decided that I wanted to kill her”, and asked him to “further elaborate on this”.  In response to ASP Teo’s request for further elaboration, the accused gave the following response:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 I was inside my dormitory when I found out that ‘Yati’ got a new Bangladeshi boyfriend.  It happened on 9 December 2018 in the evening.  I was so angry and I told myself that I would kill ‘Yati’.  I looked around and found the rope that was near my bed. The rope could be found attached at the hood of the jacket.  It was soft, tough, and easy for me to keep the rope inside my pocket.  I knew that I could strangle her to death.  I chose the hotel because I would not be able to strangle her in other locations.  Besides, I had a plan to question her to see if she agreed with me or not.  I wanted her to promise me to break up with her boyfriend.  If she listened to me and broke up the relationship, I would not kill her.  I told myself that I would bring the rope with me and kill ‘Yati’ the next time we were in the Hotel.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> 68 I did not meet ‘Yati’ on 16 December 2018. I brought my rope with me on 23 December 2018.  On 23 December 2018, when we were in the hotel, she answered all questions and agreed with me that she would continue to meet me.  When I asked her about the new relationship, she told me that she did not meet [Hanifa] and they merely talked on phone and Facebook messenger.  So, I decided not to proceed with my plan as she did not make me angry.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 On 30 December 2018, I met ‘Yati’ in the hotel.  She did not agree with me.  She did not want to break up with [Hanifa].  I strangled her to death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65    Again, the accused’s responses in paragraphs 67–69 of his 4 January 2019 statement were telling, because ASP Teo had specifically drawn his attention to the sentence containing the words “I decided that I wanted to kill her”.  That he could have failed to notice at that juncture the use of the word “decided” again beggared belief.  Indeed, having had his attention drawn to the said sentence, he responded to the request for elaboration by supplying details of his “plan” – namely, to question Yati to see if she would agree to break up with her new boyfriend, and to kill her if she did not agree.  In other words, far from denying any decision to kill Yati, the accused’s response affirmed the earlier statement about his decision to kill her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 At trial, of course, the accused did not accept that he had said anything about a decision or a plan to kill Yati.  When he was asked how Hasan had interpreted the words “I decided that I wanted to kill her” when interpreting Question 5 to him, his answers became increasingly convoluted and unbelievable.  First, he claimed that Hasan had used the Bengali words for both “think” and “decide” when interpreting Question 5.  He claimed that he did not remember exactly whether Hasan had used the Bengali word “<span class="font-italic">sirdhanto</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">thik</span>” – but he appeared quite certain that the word “<span class="font-italic">bhabso</span>” was used by Hasan for “think”.  He even suggested that there were “many” Bengali words which could be used for the English word “think”.  However, when the Prosecution sought to get him to pin down the meaning of the Bengali word “<span class="font-italic">bhabso</span>”, he again shifted position and declared that he had believed all three words – “<span class="font-italic">sirdhanto</span>”, “<span class="font-italic">thik</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">bhabso</span>” – to “[mean] the same thing”.  On being questioned further by the Prosecution, his answers became entirely illogical as he vacillated between repeating that Hasan had used the Bengali word “<span class="font-italic">bhabso</span>” and denying any memory of what Hasan had said.  I set out below the relevant extract from the trial transcript:

In my view, the accused plainly appreciated that his attempt at trial to disavow all previous statements about having “decided” to kill Yati lacked credibility, given, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the many opportunities he had been given to amend and/or to elaborate on those previous statements. In consequence, he became extremely skittish about being pinned down to any definite account of how exactly those statements had been interpreted to him; and to resist nailing his colours to the mast (so to speak), he would jump from one position to another, alternating between proclaiming his inability to recall Hasan’s words and attributing all sorts of statements to Hasan.  In short, his story about having merely told Hasan he was “thinking” about killing Yati was precisely that – a story, made up as an afterthought, to explain away the incriminating portions of his statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Moreover, if in fact all that the accused had told Hasan was that he was “thinking” about whether to kill Yati, there was no reason for Hasan to convey to ASP Teo something entirely different.  From the accused’s own evidence at trial, assuming he had said in Bengali that he was “thinking”, he would have used either the word “<span class="font-italic">bahapchi</span>” or the word “<span class="font-italic">bhabso</span>”.  It was simply not possible that Hasan – a certified interpreter of 18 years’ standing – would have confused these Bengali words for “think” with the Bengali words for “decide” (“<span class="font-italic">sirdhanto</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">thik</span>”).  The Defence did not suggest to Hasan that he had somehow misheard the accused.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the suggestion that Hasan had used the word “decide” in posing questions to the accused and that the accused had simply said “yes” to his question without knowing what the word meant, I found this suggestion equally unbelievable.  I have explained earlier why I found the accused’s evidence in this respect to be riddled with inconsistencies and lacking in credibility.  It should also be noted that in cross-examining ASP Teo, Defence counsel had put it to her that every specific question she had asked of the accused during the statement-recording was recorded in the body of the relevant statement; and that if there were any other questions, they would have been merely of a clarificatory nature, along the lines of “You said this. I don’t understand what it means”.

</div>  According to the Defence’s case, therefore, it would have been Hasan himself (and not ASP Teo) who took the initiative to introduce the word “decide” into the recording process when the accused had never used the word at all and did not even know what it meant. In my view, this was an entirely baseless proposition.  The Defence did not suggest why – in the absence of any specific questions from ASP Teo as to whether or when the accused had decided to kill Yati – Hasan should have found it necessary to put such questions of his own to the accused. Certainly I could not see any reason why – as the interpreter – Hasan would have gone on such a frolic of his own and put words in the accused’s mouth.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the reasons set out in [55]–[69], I did not believe the accused’s denial of a premeditated plan to kill Yati.  I found that the accused did indeed tell the police that as early as 9 December 2018, he had decided he wanted to kill Yati after learning of her new relationship (paragraph 20 of the 3 January 2019 statement); and further, that his plan was to ask her to break up with her new boyfriend – and to kill her if she did not agree (paragraph 67 of the 4 January 2019 statement).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Why the accused brought the rope along with him on 30 December 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The existence of such a plan was corroborated by the accused’s own admissions in his investigative statements as to why he had brought a rope along with him on 30 December 2018.  In his statement of 3 January 2019, the accused said that the rope “belonged” to one of his old jackets, and that although he had discarded the jacket long ago, he had kept the rope “to be used to tie [his] laundries together before washing”.

According to the accused, he had used the rope to tie his laundry on 9 December 2018.  While doing his laundry that day, he had been talking to Yati on the telephone and had become “very angry” upon hearing about her new boyfriend.  It was at that point that it “came to [his] head that [he] will kill her with that rope”.  He put the rope in his pocket after finishing his laundry.  The next day, he reconciled with Yati, and “everything was okay”.  He did not bother to remove the rope from his pocket, because in any event he “always” kept the rope in his pocket.  He wore the same pair of trousers (with the pocket containing the rope) when he went to meet Yati on 23 December 2018 and on 30 December 2018, because these were the trousers he “usually” wore: these trousers had “quite a number of pockets”, and he wore them for going out. Since he wore the same pair of trousers on 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018, the rope “was with [him] as well” inside the pocket, but he “didn’t carry that rope to kill [Yati]” on 30 December 2018: it just so happened that the rope was “[a]lways in [his] pocket”.

Quite apart from the details which the accused himself had volunteered in paragraph 67 of his 4 January 2019 statement, in that same statement-recording session, ASP Teo had drawn his attention to his mention of the rope in paragraph 21 of his 3 January 2019 statement and had specifically asked him to elaborate on why he had taken a rope with him on 30 December 2018.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 Since 9 December 2018, I decided that I would bring with me the rope when I knew we would be going to a Hotel.  Usually, we would plan on Friday, and we would confirm if we were going to the Hotel on Saturday.  So, on Sunday, I would know that I need to bring the rope with me.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 Between 23 December 2018 to 30 December 2018, I was quarrelling with ‘Yati’ everyday about [Hanifa].  At night, I tried to call ‘Yati’ but ‘Yati’ number was always engaged.  During the day time, I called ‘Yati’ and she received the call.  I asked her why she did not pick up my call.  I also asked her why she was closer with [Hanifa] and forgot me.  During this time, ‘Yati’ blocked my number and me in Facebook.  I was not sure if it happened on Thursday and Friday.  I contacted ‘Yati’s’ mother in Indonesia.  However, I was unable to speak Malay and her mother was unable to speak in English.  I then messaged ‘Yati’s’ sister to seek her help to get ‘Yati’ to contact me.  About half an hour later, ‘Yati’ called me.  ‘Yati’ said that our relationship had ended on 23 December 2018 when she paid me the last $500.  She also said that she had sex with me as per my request so everything was over.  I insisted to meet her and talk to me in person.  She agreed to meet up with me and she told me that it would be the last time we met.  I was very angry and I knew that I would kill her when I met her on 30 December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 In fact, I wore the same pant and shirt on 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018.  I did not remove the rope from my back pocket on 23 December 2018.  Although I did not remove the rope from my back pocket on 23 December 2018, I knew that the rope was inside my pocket when I was going to meet ‘Yati’ on 30 December 2018.  I deliberately chose the same set of attire so that I would bring the rope out with me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Again, I found the above response telling because it was provided by the accused after his attention had been drawn by ASP Teo to the issue of the rope.  If the presence of the rope in his pocket on 30 December 2018 was merely fortuitous, one would have expected him to say so to ASP Teo.  He did not.  Indeed, reading the above response together with his response in the preceding paragraphs 67–69 of the same statement, it was clear that the rope played an integral part in his plan to kill Yati: he chose it because it was tough, yet easy to keep in his pocket; he knew he could strangle Yati with it; he planned to strangle her in a hotel; and he made sure to bring the rope with him whenever he knew he and Yati would be going to a hotel.  This was why he had the rope with him on 23 December 2018 and on 30 December 2018.  In other words, the fact that he had the rope with him on 30 December 2018 was the result of a considered decision: it was not a coincidence nor an accident of ill fortune.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 At trial, the accused sought once again to blame Hasan for those portions of his statements which dealt with his possession of the rope.  According to the accused, he knew that he had killed Yati with the rope; he “didn’t want to explain everything” and “wanted to cut short the whole thing”:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So whatever [Hasan] said about the rope, I said, ‘Yes, yes.’ And the question came from Hasan about the rope and I said, ‘Yes.’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  I found the accused’s explanation unbelievable.  His assertion that he had “wanted to cut short” the statement-recording – and that he had simply answered “Yes, yes” to whatever Hasan asked about the rope – was refuted by the contents of his investigative statements, which showed that he had taken the trouble to provide various details about the rope: for example, the fact that the rope had been part of an old jacket; the use he had habitually made of it when doing his laundry; the ease with which it could be kept in his pocket, as compared to a prohibited weapon such as a knife; and his decision to bring it with him after 9 December 2018 whenever he knew he and Yati would be going to a hotel.  These were details which Hasan could not have known, and which – even if Hasan had asked about the rope – could not have been conveyed via the brief answer “Yes, yes”.  They were details which had to have been volunteered by the accused himself.  The same reasoning would apply even if it was ASP Teo who had asked the accused (through Hasan) about the rope – although in this connection, I should add that it was never put to ASP Teo that <span class="font-italic">she</span> had asked the accused questions about the rope, nor were any such questions by her recorded in the statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, the Defence argued that the fact that the accused had used a towel to strangle Yati showed that “the rope was not part of a pre-meditated plan to kill [Yati] with that particular item”.

</div>
</div>  With respect, this argument ignored facts which the accused himself had volunteered.  It was not disputed that there were two acts of strangulation – the first involving the use of the towel, the second involving the use of the rope.  According to the accused’s narrative, the rope was kept in the pocket of his trousers on 30 December 2018, just as it had been kept there on 23 December 2018.  At the point of the first act of strangulation, both the accused and Yati were naked.

</div>  In other words, the accused did not have the rope close at hand at that point.  He did have the towel in his hand at that point, according to his narrative.  He had already “rounded” the towel around Yati’s neck twice – and at one point, even around his own neck – while trying to convince her to break up with Hanifa and to stay in a relationship with him (the accused) until his return to Bangladesh.

</div>  When she refused and when he told her “Today, I will kill you”, he was holding the same towel and he “rounded” her neck with it again.  He started to tighten the towel after she “challenged” him to kill her; and this was how he came to strangle her with the towel.

</div>  In the circumstances, the use of the towel in the first act of strangulation was purely a matter of convenience: the towel was what the accused happened to have in his hands when Yati made the fatal decision to refuse once more his plea that they continue their relationship.  Significantly, when he decided to commit the second act of strangulation, he chose to do so with the rope, which he took from his trouser pocket; and from his own narrative, his use of the rope was not some hasty fumbling act but a deliberate one involving, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the “crossing” of the rope behind Yati’s neck and the tying of several knots.

</div> The CAMS tracking report showed, therefore, that Sirajul had arrived soon after Dr Cheok’s arrival, and not towards the end of the interview as the accused claimed. Dr Cheok’s evidence was that the 21 minutes prior to Sirajul’s arrival would have been used as “some degree of administrative time” (escorting the accused to the interview room, uncuffing  him, getting him seated, cuffing him again and so on).

</div>  I should add that given the terminology which would have had to be explained to the accused when he was briefed about the purpose of the interview (“psychiatric assessment”, “Institute of Mental Health”, “confidentiality”, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), I found it extremely unlikely that Dr Cheok would have attempted to explain the various terms to the accused in English.  At the same time, given the accused’s indisputably limited grasp of English, it was also extremely unlikely that Dr Cheok could have elicited all the information recorded in his interview notes without the assistance of an interpreter.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It should be pointed out that in making allegations about Sirajul’s absence on 21 January 2019, the Defence appeared to have misunderstood some of the evidence.

</div>  This was a very brief document which mentioned five things: the discovery of Yati’s corpse in the Room; Yati’s and the accused’s brief personal particulars; the existence of a “romantic relationship” between them; the certified cause of Yati’s death; and the fact that the accused had been charged for the offence of murder.  I accepted Dr Cheok’s evidence.  If the police had in fact provided him with the accused’s investigative statements, it made no sense for them to give him concurrently the brief summary of facts: such a document would have been superfluous if Dr Cheok already had the investigative statements in hand.  In any event, if Dr Cheok really had been given the investigative statements by the police prior to his interviews with the accused, I did not see (and the Defence was unable to suggest) any reason why he should have felt it necessary to lie about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the reasons set out in [81]–[85], I rejected the Defence’s submission that it was unsafe to rely on Dr Cheok’s interview notes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Dr Cheok’s interview notes were relevant because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, they established that the accused had narrated to Dr Cheok a version of events largely similar to the version narrated in his investigative statements.  In particular, the accused had told Dr Cheok about his “plan” to bring Yati to the Hotel and to kill her if she refused to remain in the relationship with him until he returned to Bangladesh. As with the accused’s investigative statements, therefore, Dr Cheok’s interview notes supported the Prosecution’s contention that the accused’s killing of Yati was carried out in accordance with a premeditated plan.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Dr Cheok’s interview notes were also relevant to the determination of another important issue: namely, whether Yati had in fact spoken the Humiliating Words to the accused in the Room on 30 December 2018.  I next address this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the alleged Humiliating Words were in fact spoken by Yati to the accused in the Room on 30 December 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As I noted earlier at [51], the accused’s contention that he had killed Yati completely on impulse and not in accordance with any premeditated plan rested on two key factual propositions.  The first was that he had never told the police – or Dr Cheok – about a decision or a plan to kill Yati.  The second was that Yati had spoken the Humiliating Words to him in the Room on 30 December 2018.  I have explained why I rejected the first proposition.  I will now explain why I also rejected the second proposition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To recap: in its closing submissions, the Defence identified the following as the Humiliating Words:

Yet, as the accused himself admitted, he said nothing at all about the Humiliating Words to the police and to Dr Cheok.

</div>  It seemed to me quite unbelievable that the “kind” and “nice” ASP Lee should have taken it upon himself to admonish and alarm the accused by telling him that he was “stupid” and that his life would “go away”.  Furthermore, there was simply no reason for ASP Lee to admonish and alarm the accused in this manner: he had no connection with the case other than having been requested to record the cautioned statement from the accused, and he was not aware of the details of the case – not even that a rope had been used.

</div>  In the circumstances, it would have made no sense for ASP Lee to make any comments to the accused about his actions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In any event, even assuming that ASP Lee had somehow taken it upon himself to tell the accused that he was “stupid” and that his life would “go away”, there was no logical connection between these comments and the accused’s alleged decision to refrain from mentioning the Humiliating Words in his cautioned statement.  When the accused was asked to explain what one had to do with the other, he could not provide any explanation and ended up merely repeating, “I was going to die”.

</div>  I should add that it did not appear to me the accused meant by this statement that he had fatalistically decided it was futile to say anything of importance in his cautioned statement.  Indeed, despite having allegedly concluded that he “was going to die”, he had still found it necessary to state in his cautioned statement that he had proof of Yati having had “another relationship with another guy”, that he had “spent a lot of money on her” and that she had “cheated” on him.

As noted above, Defence counsel had put it to ASP Lee that his job was simply to record whatever the accused said: it was not put to ASP Lee that he had tried to cut the accused off in the course of his narrative.  Not was it put to ASP Lee that he had given the accused the impression he was required to give his cautioned statement in a “shortcut way”.  There was no reason, therefore, why the accused should have felt apprehensive about mentioning details such as the Humiliating Words.  Indeed the contents of the accused’s cautioned statement disproved his allegations about having been afraid to say too much.  As noted above, the accused had sought to explain the killing of Yati by saying that he had done it “out of anger, because [he had] proof that she ha[d] another relationship with another guy” and she had “cheated” on him after he had “spent a lot of money on her”.  He had also given details of how he strangled Yati first with a towel and then with a rope.

After all, in recounting to ASP Teo the events of 30 December 2018, he had already told her about having sex with Yati twice in the Room, about their remaining naked in the Room even as they continued to quarrel over Yati’s relationship with Hanifa,

Far from having exercised restraint in disclosing what Yati had said or done to him, he had provided a copious amount of information about Yati’s behaviour towards him which included the rude or harsh things she had said and done to him.  For example, he said that he had “spent a lot of money on her” and had bought her things such as a pre-paid phone card.

</div> – which was no answer at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the reasons set out in [103]–[105], I rejected the accused’s explanations as to why he omitted to mention the Humiliating Words in his interviews with Dr Cheok.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 To sum up, therefore: given the significance of the Humiliating Words in relation to the accused’s actions in killing Yati, one would have expected him to mention this when he was interviewed by the police and Dr Cheok.  This was all the more so when he had taken the trouble to provide both the police and Dr Cheok with details of various things said and done by Yati in the Room on 30 December 2018.  As noted above, none of the accused’s explanations for his failure to mention the Humiliating Words could be believed.  In my view, the accused’s account of these Humiliating Words to Dr Ung some 17 months after Yati’s death – and subsequently at trial – was yet another story he had made up.  Pertinently, Dr Ung agreed at trial that in criminal cases of this nature, there would be “the motivation to falsify, distort or exaggerate facts to avoid punishment”; and that the “lapse of time” after the killing “would have given [the accused] more time to think up and come up with such falsehoods, distortions and exaggerations”.

</div>  With respect, this was in my view precisely what the accused had done.  It was clear that having killed Yati in accordance with his premeditated plan, he later decided to find some way of avoiding or minimising responsibility for the killing.  To do so, he had to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, rebut any inference of premeditation or pre-planning; and this was why, more than a year thereafter, he came up with the story of the Humiliating Words (in addition to the other falsehoods I have earlier addressed – see [52]–[70], [72]–[78] and [80]–[86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 To recap: the accused’s claim about the alleged utterance of the Humiliating Words by Yati was an important part of the narrative of the killing which he presented to Dr Ung and at trial – his narrative being one of an “impulsive” killing, committed in the spur of the moment, and without any premeditation or planning.  Clearly, the alleged utterance of these Humiliating Words was central to the two partial defences which the accused invoked: that of diminished responsibility (Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code) (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”)), and that of grave and sudden provocation (Exception 1 to s 300 of the PC.

It is especially the case in this context that while medical evidence would be important in determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether an accused’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired is ultimately a question of fact that is to be decided by the court based on all the evidence before it … Substantial impairment in this context does not require total impairment; but nor would trivial or minimal impairment suffice.  What is required is an impairment of the mental state that is real and material but which need not rise to the level of amounting to the defence of unsoundness of mind under s 84 of the Penal Code … Further, the requirement of substantial impairment does not entail that the offender’s abnormality of mind must be the <span class="font-italic">cause</span> of his offending.

There was an attempt by Defence counsel to suggest that Dr Cheok’s testimony that the AD had caused “some impairment” of the accused’s mental state really amounted to conceding that the impairment to the accused’s mental responsibility for the killing of Yati was “not trivial” – and thus “substantial”.

</div>  With respect, the suggestion was misconceived.  To begin with, it was hardly surprising that Dr Cheok should have opined that there was “some” impairment of the accused’s state of mind arising from the AD.  Had he found no impairment of the accused’s state of mind at all, he would not have been able to arrive at his conclusion that the accused suffered from an abnormality of mind – since an absence of any impairment would have meant that the accused’s mental state was no different from that of “ordinary human beings”.  Dr Cheok’s evidence as to there having been “some” impairment of the accused’s mental state arising from the AD thus meant nothing less and nothing more than what he had said.  In any event, any suggestion that Dr Cheok’s answer about “some” impairment of the accused’s mental state amounted to a concession that there was impairment of his mental responsibility for the killing which was “not trivial” would invest the doctor’s testimony with a significance or weight that was entirely misplaced.  As the CA has been at pains to point out in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span> (at [33]) and <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2011] 1 SLR 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span>”) (at [64]), in the context of Exception 7, the assessment of whether there has been impairment of the accused’s mental responsibility which was “real and material” – as opposed to being “trivial” or “minimal” – is largely a question of commonsense to be decided by the trial court as the finder of fact.  While medical evidence would be important in  determining the presence and/or extent of impairment, whether an accused’s mental responsibility was substantially impaired is ultimately a question of fact to be decided by the court based on all the evidence before it: that is, not only the medical evidence but also all other relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the accused before, during and after the offence (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Ong Pang Siew</span> at [59]–[60] and [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In respect of the second limb, both doctors were agreed that this too was satisfied in that AD was a recognised mental disorder or disease. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The third limb </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In respect of the third limb of Exception 7, as the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Wang Zhijian and another appeal</span> [2014] SGCA 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Wang Zhijian</span>”) at [67]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]here are three usual ways in which a psychiatric condition might substantially impair a person’s mental responsibility.

In this sense there is a ‘causal link’ between his disorder and his offending behaviour.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Whilst Dr Ung referred in his report to the accused’s “judgment” being “impaired”, it was clear from his testimony that he did not mean the accused’s judgment of what was right or wrong had been impaired.  Instead, he appeared to be referring to two separate matters.  First, it will be recalled that the Prosecution’s case was that the accused killed Yati in accordance with a plan which he had devised prior to 30 December 2018, in which he had decided that he would ask Yati to leave Hanifa and to remain in a relationship with him (the accused) until his return to Bangladesh – and he would refrain from killing her if she agreed to do so, but would kill her if she refused.  This was what Dr Cheok had in his testimony referred to as the “algorithm” or “decision tree” formulated by the accused.

</div>  It must be pointed out, however, that this was simply another way of saying that the accused’s self-control was impaired.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Prosecution, in disagreeing with the Defence on the third limb, contended that far from there having been “substantial impairment” of the accused’s mental responsibility for his actions, the killing of Yati was a deliberate act carried out in accordance with his premeditated plan.  Aside from relying on Dr Cheok’s evidence, the Prosecution also pointed to the evidence of the accused’s conduct before, during and after the killing which, in their submission, demonstrated that his self-control remained intact throughout.  According to the Prosecution, the evidence showed that “the accused demonstrated presence of mind and was able to rationally make decisions and act in a goal-directed manner before, during and after the killing”. The accused’s reasons for killing Yati also indicated that it “was a considered act of violence, motivated by a mixture of [his] pre-existing grievances against [Yati] and other instrumental reasons”.

I did not accept this proposition.  My reasons were as follows.  From his evidence-in-chief (as set out above), what Dr Ung appeared to be saying was this: deciding to kill one’s faithless lover would be a poor decision (whether in terms of moral culpability or criminal liability) – <span class="font-italic">ergo</span>, only someone with AD would make such a poor decision, because a “normal” person would decide to take some other course of action (finding a new lover, avoiding romantic entanglements, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) which would not carry the risk of such moral culpability or criminal liability.  With respect, this proposition appeared to me to be really a value judgment, unsupported by any medical grounds or, for that matter, by any evidence.  Indeed, in cross-examination, Dr Ung conceded that “a normal person with no psychiatric illness would also make poor choices and be more impulsive when they are emotional”.

As I observed earlier, this really amounted to saying the accused’s self-control was impaired; and in re-examination, Dr Ung did in fact frame it as such.

In the first place, as seen from the above response Dr Ung gave in re-examination, this proposition was premised on the accused’s ability to “inhibit certain behaviours” having been compromised by the “surge of negative emotions” he experienced on 30 December 2018 when he “finally” heard from Yati that she had a new Bangladeshi boyfriend and did not want a relationship with him anymore.  However, this factual premise was not borne out – and was actually contradicted – by the accused’s own evidence.

</div>  Between 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018, the accused and Yati quarrelled everyday about her new Bangladeshi boyfriend.  He could not reach her on the telephone; and when he did manage to get her to call him, she told him that “everything was over”: their relationship had ended on 23 December 2018, the day when she repaid him the last $500 she owed him and had sex with him “as per [his] request”.

</div>  In the circumstances, there was no evidential basis for the proposition that the accused had suffered a “<span class="font-italic">surge</span> of negative emotions” [emphasis added] on “finally” learning on 30 December 2018 that Yati had a new boyfriend and did not wish to continue their relationship.  Indeed, according to the Defence’s submissions, it was the Humiliating Words from Yati that “specifically provoked” the accused and “were too much for [him] to bear”.

These statements by the accused showed that far from having strangled Yati on “impulse” upon hearing the Humiliating Words on 30 December 2018, the accused had – by 9 December 2018 – already formulated a clear “algorithm” for action, whereby he would demand that she continue their relationship until his return to Bangladesh – and proceed with killing her if she refused.

</div>  Indeed, even leaving aside his express affirmations of such a “decision” and “plan” in his investigative statements and in his interviews with Dr Cheok, the evidence of his conduct before and during the killing showed only too distinctly that he had a plan to put this “algorithm” into action and was fully capable of taking the steps necessary to execute this plan.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Thus, prior to meeting Yati on 30 December 2018, the accused had already determined on 9 December 2018 how and where he would kill her.  As he explained in his statement of 4 January 2019, after learning of Yati’s new Bangladeshi boyfriend on 9 December 2018 and resolving to kill her, he had settled on strangulation as the method of killing (“I knew that I could strangle her to death”), and on the rope from his jacket as his weapon of choice (“It was soft, tough, and easy … to keep … inside my pocket”).

On the evening of the same day, however, she told him to go back to Bangladesh to get married and spoke about Hanifa again.  He persuaded her to meet him on the following Sunday – which was 30 December 2018.  They went to the Hotel again on that day – and that was when and where he strangled her to death.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 From the above sequence of events and the accused’s conduct between 9 December 2018 and 30 December 2018, it was clear that the accused was capable not only of formulating a step-by-step plan for killing Yati (where, how, when and under what conditions) but also of following that plan and executing it only when the requisite conditions were met (when they were at the Hotel and after she refused his demand to continue their relationship). This was demonstrably rational, goal-directed behaviour which would have required a certain measure of self-control.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Indeed, it must be highlighted that even before 30 December 2018, Yati had already caused much anguish to the accused when she met him in person on the night of 9 December 2018.  Not only had she failed to answer his calls that day, she had accused him of “disturbing” her” and had even talked to someone at her employer’s residence about calling for the police.  When she finally agreed to meet him at the void deck of her employer’s residence, she had “expressed her anger” by scolding him (“she told me that I act like mad”).  On that occasion, the accused would no doubt have experienced a considerable amount of emotional upheaval,  especially since it was “the first time she was talking like this”.

</div>  As he himself put it, he was “suspicious and was very angry”.  Yet, notably, the accused committed no acts of violence against Yati that day.  Instead, it was upon her confirming to him that very same night the existence of a new Bangladeshi boyfriend that he came up with the step-by-step plan to kill her (“I looked around and found the rope … I chose the hotel … I had a plan to question her to see if she agreed with me or not.  I wanted her to promise me to break up with her boyfriend.  If she listened to me and broke up the relationship, I would not kill her.”

</div>).  In other words, the accused kept his emotions sufficiently in check on 9 December 2018 to refrain from any violent reaction to the aggravation from Yati; he started formulating his plan to kill her only after receiving confirmation of her new boyfriend Hanifa; and even then, he did not rush into action despite ongoing quarrels with Yati about Hanifa between 23 December 2018 and 30 December 2018, but kept to the algorithm he had formulated, killing her only on 30 December 2018 when she refused his demand to continue their relationship.  In my view, this was assuredly not the behaviour of a man whose self-control was hostage to his “fluctuating”

</div> prior to strangling Yati to death, he “rounded” the towel around Yati’s neck and threatened to kill her twice.  Each time she defied him by refusing his demand that she break up with Hanifa.  He did not strangle her on these first two occasions.  In between, he had sex with her again; he sent Hanifa a text message; and he even offered to let her strangle him.  It was only on the third occasion of “rounding” the towel around her neck – after all his various pleas and stratagems had failed to move her – that he finally tightened the towel and strangled her to death.  Crucially, even on this third occasion, he was still able to assess the situation he was in and to weigh up his options: in both his 3 January 2019 statement and his 4 January 2019 statement, he said he “realised” as he was tightening the towel on the third occasion that “if [he] left her in this circumstance, she would call for police”.

</div>  This revelation was telling, because it showed that even at the point of tightening the towel around Yati’s neck (on the third occasion that he had “rounded” the towel around her neck), the accused was still capable of looking at his situation from an instrumental perspective.  Again, this was not the behaviour of a man whose will-power and self-control were overwhelmed by the “surge of negative emotions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The accused’s actions after the act of strangulation with the towel showed the same signs of deliberation and purposefulness.  After this first act of strangulation, he carried out several further acts which were designed to “make sure that [Yati] was dead”:

</div> he retrieved from his back pocket the rope he had brought with him, wound and knotted this around Yati’s neck, and strangled her a second time; and he also used a towel to press down hard on her mouth and nose before twisting her head forcefully from left to right.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In considering the evidence of the accused’s actions <span class="font-italic">after </span>the killing of Yati, I had to bear in mind the fact that some of the actions relied on by the Prosecution were carried out not in the immediate aftermath of Yati’s death, but after some time had elapsed – for example, his actions in removing Yati’s valuables (cash, an ez-link card and her handphone) before leaving the Room, and instructing Khalik to remit money to his family in Bangladesh.  In my view, care had to be taken not to give undue weight to actions carried out by the accused after some time had already elapsed from the killing of Yati.  It could be argued that they provided no guide to the state of impairment of his mental responsibility for the killing, simply because enough time had passed for him to curb his emotions and regain self-control.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In my view, in any event, the evidence of the accused’s actions <span class="font-italic">before</span> and <span class="font-italic">during</span> the killing of Yati already sufficed to establish that his will-power and self-control were unimpaired.  I did not think this was a case where the evidence of the accused’s actions <span class="font-italic">after</span> the killing of Yati was crucial in tilting the balance.  What I did note, though, was that nothing in the evidence of his post-killing conduct militated against the inference that his will-power and self-control were unimpaired.  This included the evidence of how the accused had put Yati’s clothes back on her body after killing her, because he “did not want anyone else to see her naked”; how he placed her body in a sleeping position on her left side facing the window because he “wanted to know if she would change her position” if he left the room and came back;

In the first place, his suggestion that the substantial impairment to the accused’s mental state would have occurred “at that particular point in time when he was rejected” appeared to assume that there was only one particular “rejection” suffered by the accused on 30 December 2018 – whereas, as seen from above (at [137]), Yati rejected the accused’s demands for her to continue their relationship several times in the course of their interaction in the Room on 30 December 2018.  In the second place, Dr Ung’s approach really constituted an attempt to “compartmentalise [the accused’s] mental responsibility <span class="font-italic">during </span>the time of the offence into split-second journeys of rational thinking and substantial impairment” [emphasis in original] – which was exactly what the CA cautioned against in <span class="font-italic">Zailani bin Ahmad v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 356 (“<span class="font-italic">Zailani</span>”) at [64]. As the CA in <span class="font-italic">Zailani </span>put it, this attempt at “split-second compartmentalisation” made for “an artificial and convenient excuse rather than the truth”.  Indeed, with respect, Dr Ung did not provide any grounds for his proposition that it was possible for the accused’s symptoms to “fluctuate” on a virtually split-second basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 To sum up, therefore: in so far as the Defence sought to suggest (relying on Dr Ung’s testimony) that only a person with AD would have developed the sort of “algorithm” the accused did, I have explained why I found this suggestion to be baseless and misconceived.  In so far as the Defence contended (again relying on Dr Ung’s evidence) that “increased impulsivity” from the accused’s AD impaired his will-power to resist killing Yati, I have also explained why I found this contention wholly refuted by the evidence available.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144    In the course of cross-examining Dr Cheok, the Defence also sought to suggest that the accused was actually suicidal and had engaged in a “suicide attempt” on 30 December 2018.

From counsel’s cross-examination of Dr Cheok, the Defence appeared to be suggesting that the accused’s AD put him at increased risk of suicide (or suicide attempt) because persons with AD “want to put an end to their distress”; and that this was in fact what the accused had sought to achieve by killing Yati: he wanted to end his “suffering” by ending his life – and he would achieve this by getting caught, getting charged and getting hanged for causing Yati’s death.

</div>  However, as with any of the statements made by the accused (whether to the police or to the psychiatrists), such statements had to be evaluated against the other evidence of the accused’s actual behaviour; and when so evaluated, it was obvious that far from having intended to “surrender to [the] police” and to accept punishment for his killing of Yati, the accused made concerted efforts to evade capture in the aftermath of the killing. It will be recalled that in his investigative statements, the accused had said more than once that he realised in the course of tightening the towel around Yati’s neck that he could not leave her like that because she would call the police (see [137] above).

</div> Once again, this was behaviour which was inconsistent with the accused’s claims about wanting to surrender to the police. When confronted with this evidence, the accused alleged that he had struggled because the officers who arrested him were not wearing uniforms and he “didn’t know they were police”, so when they “got hold of [him]” and “touched [his] neck”, he “got angry”.

In this connection, I have already explained why I found that the evidence of the accused’s behaviour showed him to have acted in a considered and goal-directed manner (see [130]–[143]).  As to why the accused would have told Khalik that his “mind was wrong” and that he had killed Yati “without thinking”, I found the explanation suggested by Dr Cheok to be persuasive.

As a preliminary note, this is problematic.  Dr Cheok appears to be taking too segmented an approach to whether the accused exercised self-control and judgment on the day itself.  As the Court of Appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span>] opined at [4]–[6], the question should be more composite than that.  In [<span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span>], the Court of Appeal found it strange that the trial judge concluded that despite the accused meeting limbs (a) and (b) [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first and second limbs under Exception 7], the accused did not meet limb (c) [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the third limb] at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In respect of the above argument, it was wholly inaccurate of the Defence to describe Dr Cheok as having dealt with the issue of self-control simply by “highlight[ing] the fact the accused exercised self-control on the day in question because he tightened and released the towel three times before going through with his act”.  Contrary to the Defence’s submission, besides the evidence of the accused having “rounded” the towel around Yati’s neck on three occasions, Dr Cheok brought up in his testimony various other pieces of evidence which he had relied on to conclude that the accused’s self-control was not impaired: for example, the fact that the accused had been able – whilst strangling Yati - to tell himself that she might report him to the police if he “didn’t finish the process”;

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 As for the reference to <span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span>, it was not made clear exactly how the decision in that case could assist the present accused in establishing diminished responsibility.  The CA in <span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span> was not suggesting that there was anything wrong in principle with the three-stage test conventionally applied by the courts when considering the partial defence under Exception 7: in its judgment, the court acknowledged (at [4]) that the three-stage test was a “convenient way of drawing attention to the three critical aspects of the provision in many cases”, though it also cautioned that it might “sometimes [admit] of a misapplication of the law”. In <span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span> itself, the CA held that the trial judge had misapplied the law in the following manner.  The trial judge had accepted that the appellant in that case suffered from morbid jealousy which was a disease of the mind and a major mental illness.  It was moreover a case in which the disease of the mind had “a close, if not the only, connection between the appellant’s act and [the deceased’s] death – a direct correlation between the subject appellant and the object deceased”.  Yet, despite these findings, the trial judge had rejected the reasoned medical opinion before him and had instead drawn various arbitrary distinctions in considering the evidence.  Further, having already found the accused to be suffering from an abnormality of mind (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, morbid jealousy), the trial judge had nevertheless gone on to draw comparisons between the appellant’s “obsessive feelings” and the jealous feelings experienced by persons without such abnormality of mind, seeming to suggest that since the latter could exercise self-restraint, there was no reason why the appellant could not.  At the end of the day, therefore, the CA held that while it was “conceptually possible” for the third limb of Exception 7 not to be satisfied even if the first two were, in <span class="font-italic">Kr</span><span class="font-italic">ishnasamy</span> the trial judge had failed to provide convincing reasons why he found the third limb not made out.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 If in citing <span class="font-italic">Kr</span><span class="font-italic">ishnasamy</span>, the Defence was suggesting that the third limb of Exception 7 must be satisfied in most if not all cases where the first two limbs were satisfied, then such a suggestion would be erroneous: the CA’s judgment did not establish any such general principle; and local case law is not short of cases where the court has held the third limb of Exception 7 not to be satisfied after finding the first two limbs to be made out: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Wang Zhijian</span>.  It should also be noted that in the CA’s recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>, they described (at [21]) the conventional three-stage test as being “cumulative requirements”; and on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>, the CA held (at [34]) that even if they were to assume in the appellant’s favour that the first two limbs were satisfied, they were still unable to accept that the appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the offences.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 For the reasons I have set out in [114]–[157], I held that the accused was unable to establish the partial defence of diminished responsibility on a balance of probabilities.

In assessing whether the objective test was met, there were two types of characteristics which the court could take into account: characteristics affecting a similarly placed reasonable man’s level of self-control and characteristics affecting the gravity of the provocation (at [51]).

</div>  For the reasons I have set out at [90]–[107], I found that there were no such words spoken by Yati to the accused on 30 December 2018.  In other words, the factual premise for the accused’s reliance on the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation was non-existent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In any event, for the reasons I have set out at [51]–[87], I found that this was a premeditated killing.  After learning about Yati’s new Bangladeshi boyfriend on 9 December 2018, the accused had already decided to kill her; he developed an algorithm whereby he would kill her if she refused to continue their relationship but would spare her if she agreed; and he came up with a step-by-step plan for the killing.  Since this was a premeditated killing, the question of loss of self-control by the accused was without more, quite irrelevant.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Further, even assuming the Humiliating Words had been spoken by Yati, the evidence set out at [129]–[143] showed clearly that there was no loss of self-control by the accused throughout the killing.  Looking at the series, the nature  and the sequence of acts the accused performed throughout the killing, he went about making sure of Yati’s death in a purposeful and systematic manner: strangling her with the towel; retrieving the rope and tightening it around her neck with multiple knots to effect a second strangulation; pressing on her mouth and nose with a towel; and finally twisting her head forcefully.  On the evidence before me, it was simply <span class="font-italic">not</span> possible to describe this case as a crime of impulse committed in the heat of the moment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 I should add that the Prosecution relied on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>evidence of the accused’s post-killing conduct in contending that there was no loss of self-control (for example, his actions in extending the hotel room rental, haggling over the room rental rate, and taking Yati’s valuables with him).

However, while I did not rely on the accused’s conduct post-killing to make any inferences about his self-control at the time of the killing, nothing about his conduct post-killing militated against my finding that he did not lose self-control; in fact, quite the opposite. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Finally, even assuming the Humiliating Words were uttered by Yati, I did not find that on a balance of probabilities, an ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused, sharing his characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, would have been so provoked as to suddenly lose his self-control. This was so even if the accused’s AD was included as one of the characteristics to be considered.  Even assuming the Humiliating Words were spoken, they could not be viewed in isolation; and their effects on the accused had to be considered against the background of their relationship: <span class="font-italic">Pathip </span>at [59].  As the Prosecution pointed out, although the accused and Yati had a long history together, by mid-2018 their relationship had broken down.  It was not disputed that even before her relationship with Hanifa, Yati had already cheated on the accused by having a relationship with another Bangladeshi man (Shamim) in May or June 2018.  It was also not disputed that even after Yati broke up with Shamim and reconciled with the accused, he had gone ahead with his plans for an arranged marriage, going so far as to apply for home leave in February 2019 to return to Bangladesh for the wedding.  While he had demanded that Yati continue her relationship with him until his return to Bangladesh, he was prepared for the possibility of rebuff: as he disclosed in his investigative statement of 3 January 2019,

</div> by the evening of 23 December 2018 she had already made it clear that she would not remain in a relationship with him even for the one month before his departure for Bangladesh, and she maintained this position right up to 30 December 2018.  The accused himself noted that by this time, Yati was not picking up his calls; and even when she acceded to his request for a meeting in person, she told him “it would be the last time [they] met”.  In the accused’s own words, she “was closer with [Hanifa]”;

</div> and this was something he already recognised even before 30 December 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In light of the above evidence, even assuming Yati had spoken the Humiliating Words to the accused on 30 December 2018, I did not find it probable that the utterance of these words would have transported the accused’s passions to such an extent that he lost his self-control momentarily.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Given the heavy reliance placed by the Defence on <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>, I should make it clear that I considered the present case to be very much distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>.  First, it must be remembered that in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span>, it was accepted by the Prosecution, the Defence and the CA that the killing was not premeditated.  In contrast, in the present case, the evidence pointed clearly to a premeditated killing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Secondly, unlike the alleged provocation in the present case, the provocation in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span> was sudden. The CA in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span> found that the appellant had arranged to meet the deceased to reconcile with rather than to harm – let alone, to kill – her: for example, he had arranged to meet the deceased in a public place and had asked for her mother’s permission to marry her.  Shortly before proceeding to meet the deceased, he had also told his friends that he was going to meet her and would return with her later.  He had thus expected the deceased to beg for his forgiveness, with the two of them reconciling thereafter.  This was not the case with the present accused: as noted earlier, he was well aware by 23 December 2018 that Yati would not remain in a relationship with him even for the one month pending his return to Bangladesh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 It should also be noted that the killing in <span class="font-italic">Pathip</span> was clearly carried out in an “entirely random and frenzied manner” [emphasis in original omitted] with numerous external injuries inflicted over multiple regions of the deceased’s body (<span class="font-italic">Pathip</span> at [41]).  In contrast, as highlighted earlier, the evidence in this case showed the killing of Yati to have been methodically executed and far from frenzied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 For the reasons I have set out in [163]–[171], I held that the accused was unable to establish the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The submission by the Defence for a conviction under an alternative charge under s 300(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Given the findings I made in this case, there were simply no grounds for the belated contention in the Defence’s closing submissions that the accused ought to be convicted of an alternative charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PC.  Section 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) relates to culpable homicide done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, where the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.  As I explained at [43]–[50], however, in the present case there could be no doubt at all that the accused acted with the intention to cause Yati’s death.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 For the foregoing reasons, I held that the Prosecution had proven the charge of murder against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I also held that the accused was unable to avail himself of either the partial defence of diminished responsibility or the partial defence of grave and sudden provocation. I therefore convicted the accused of the charge of murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Under s 302(1) of the PC, whoever commits murder within the meaning of s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) shall be punished with death.  Having convicted the accused of the charge under s 300(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), I accordingly imposed the mandatory death sentence.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hay Hung Chun, Senthilkumaran Sabapathy, Soh Weiqi and Deborah Lee (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen and Hamza Zafar Malik (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
