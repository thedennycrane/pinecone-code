Léo Loubère, in <span class="font-italic">The Wine Revolution in France – The Twentieth Century</span> (Princeton University Press, 1990) at p 114, traces the practice to ancient Greek and Roman efforts at wine regulation, and remarks that the connection between geography and quality had become “a widely accepted belief, if not to say myth,” by the nineteenth century. Dev Gangjee, in <span class="font-italic">Relocating the Law of Geographical Indications </span>(Cambridge University Press, 2012) at pp 93–96, attributes the prompt for the modern French system of regulation to the crisis experienced in French vineyards in the late nineteenth century, brought on first by fungal diseases, and then a pandemic of phylloxera. Following the dramatic destruction of French vineyards, counterfeits flourished in tandem with the decrease in the production of wine. France enacted a law in 1905 prohibiting the misuse of wine names to address fraud in the wine marketplace. What began as a tradition to mandate quality-related criteria, such as the controlled planting and cultivation of vines and their yields, grew into a basis for delimiting the products whose quality was attributable to their specific region of production. Over time, different jurisdictions used a variety of methods to ensure the accuracy of geographical source as an indicium of specific quality or reputation for a wide range of products. Such attributions are deeply historical. Not all geographical locations serve to indicate specific reputational characteristics of a product. Conversely, not all geographical indications need be names of geographical locations; non-geographical names may, through tradition, nevertheless function to identify a product’s geographical source.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This perception of origin as a proxy for quality was used to economic advantage not only by canny merchants, but also by nation-states in their relations with each other. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, reports Paul Duguid in “Networks and Knowledge: The Beginning and End of the Port Community Chain, 1703-1860” (2005) 79(3) Business History Review 453, British customs officials were careful to verify the origin of Port wine because such wines from Portugal were favoured with preferential duties in England. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The modern global economy has accentuated the value of such reputational links between products and their sources. At the same time, the nature, conceptual approach, scope and institutional forms of protection available are diverse across jurisdictions. As a result, provisions to protect geographical indications feature within many international trade agreements. Susanna Leong recounts in <span class="font-italic">Intellectual Property Law of Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Academy Publishin<span class="font-italic">g, </span>2013) at para 34.005 that the history of these international agreements, from the Paris Convention 1883, to the Madrid Agreement (Indications of Source) 1891, the Lisbon Agreement 1958, and the World Trade Organization (“WTO”)’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”) in 1994, “tells the story of a relentless campaign for more than a century by wine producers (French in particular) to secure comprehensive international protection against misappropriation and misuse of GIs”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 These negotiations recognise that within each jurisdiction, protection depends upon the specific legal framework in place. Whether a sign functions as a geographical indication is a matter of national law. In 1998, Singapore enacted its first Geographical Indications Act – the Geographical Indications Act 1998 (Act 44 of 1998), later replaced by the Geographical Indications Act (Cap 117B, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the 1999 GIA”) – to comply with its obligations under TRIPS. This 1999 GIA did not set up a registration system; it granted the owner of any indication that fulfilled the definition of a geographical indication (“GI”) the ability to file suit for protection. In 2014, in compliance with Singapore’s obligations under the European Union – Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the 1999 GIA was repealed and replaced by the Geographical Indications Act 2014 (Act 19 of 2014) (“the GIA”). This GIA further enhanced the protection of GIs. As part of this enhanced protection, a registration system was set up at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The present appeal arises out of an application (“the Application”) made by the Consorzio di Tutela della Denominazione di Origine Controllata Prosecco (“the Consorzio”) to register “Prosecco” as a GI denoting wines originating from a specified region in Northern Italy (“the Application GI”).

Many official authorities and bodies from various countries had recognised “Prosecco” to be the name of a grape variety. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, for example, provisionally refused the Consorzio’s application to register “Prosecco” as a certification mark in the US in November 2020 on the ground that “Prosecco” was “an <span class="font-italic">internationally recognized grape variety</span> used to make wines by the same name” [emphasis added].

Indeed, the fact that both Italy and the European Union (“EU”) found it necessary to take the extraordinary step of legislating in 2009 that the “Prosecco” grape variety would thenceforth be known as “Glera” buttressed the point that the use of “Prosecco” as the name of a grape variety was very common and widespread (see Italy’s Ministerial Decree of 17 July 2009 and the EU’s Commission Regulation (EC) No 1166/2009, [2009] OJ L 314/27 dated 30 November 2009 (“EU Regulation 1166”) amending and correcting Regulation (EC) No 606/2009).

The view of the consumer is not expressed as part of the first limb. The emphasis of the first limb is factual: whether the GI “<span class="font-italic">contains</span> the name of a plant variety or an animal breed” [emphasis added]. The Consorzio’s approach would add extra words, and there was no basis in the language of s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA for the additional requirement to be implied. Instead, the perspective of the Singapore consumer was relevant only to the second limb of s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA, in ascertaining whether the GI was “likely to mislead <span class="font-italic">the consumer</span> as to the true origin of the product” [emphasis added]. The interests of the consumer are safeguarded through the second limb. A statutory provision ought to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. A purposive construction becomes particularly relevant only if there are two or more possible interpretations of a given legislative provision: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bo</span><span class="font-italic">ck v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 A further argument made by the Consorzio was that its interpretation of s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA was necessary to make sense of s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA. Section 4 of the GIA allows an interested party of goods identified by a GI to bring an action against another for using the GI in one of the ways specified in s 4(2) of the GIA.  Division 2 of the GIA, which starts with s 15 of the GIA, lists exceptions applicable to registered GIs. Section 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Certain uses of registered geographical indications excepted</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15. </span>Section 4 shall not apply to — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  the use in the course of trade of a registered geographical indication, or any term contained in a registered geographical indication, that is the name of a plant variety or an animal breed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Consorzio submitted that the phrase “the name of a plant variety or an animal breed” should bear the same meaning in both s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA. Flowing from this, the Consorzio asserted that it would lead to incongruous and unreasonable outcomes if the first limb of s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA were satisfied simply because a GI contained the name of a plant variety or animal breed in <span class="font-italic">some or any country</span>. The Consorzio argued that this would render the registration of such GIs otiose. This was because, despite the registration, any interested party would not be able to enforce the rights in the registered GI against third parties in Singapore who used the GI in the course of trade <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> some or any country </span>which recognised the term as the name of a plant variety or animal breed, even if the significance of that term was not recognised or understood as such <span class="font-italic">by Singapore consumers</span>. Instead, under the Consorzio’s proposed interpretation, the exceptions to a registered GI holder’s rights under s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA would only apply where the significance of the term was recognised and understood as such <span class="font-italic">in Singapore</span>.

This, however, did not lead to statutory absurdity, contrary to the Consorzio’s submission. The GIA is consistent in excluding appropriate uses of names of plant varieties from its regulatory regime. This is consonant with the object of GIs to make goods attributable to their geographical origin, and to guard against the wrongful use of indicators of geographical origin. The logic of s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA may be seen in applying the section to the example of the registered GI, “Conegliano Valdobbiadene – Prosecco”<span class="font-italic">.</span> Such a GI would not, for example, bar the use of the word “Prosecco” in the course of trade <span class="font-italic">as a plant variety</span>. It is the same policy intent behind the need in s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA to ensure that any registration of a plant variety is not misleading to the consumer. The object of the statutory scheme is to ensure that the registration of a GI is not misleading, not only at the point of registration but also post-registration. As such, s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA permits any use of registered GIs in the course of trade <span class="font-italic">as a plant variety</span>, as such use would be appropriate use, and not misuse. Therefore, contrary to the Consorzio’s assumption, even if “Prosecco” were registered as a GI, s 15(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the GIA serves to limit the Consorzio’s ability to use the remedies provided for under Part II of the GIA where “Prosecco” is used in the course of trade as a plant variety. In my view, this is not surprising once the historical context I highlighted at [1]–[4] is understood. GIs may be drawn from a rich diversity of names and the GIA takes cognisance of the potential that a name of a plant variety could <span class="font-italic">function</span> as a GI. In such a case, the imperative remains that it must guarantee the accuracy of the relevant geographical-reputational attribution. In this respect, I draw a distinction with other forms of intellectual property that protect distinctive marks or names that serve as indications of commercial origin, rather than of location origin. The Consorzio in its submissions placed emphasis on a Singapore-registered mark which contained the words “Prosecco PDO” within a round shape.

</div> The existence of this registered mark did not add to the Consorzio’s argument because the object of a GI is not to protect the use of a distinctive mark or name. GIs are necessarily descriptive: they serve as geographical attributions which accurately link the origins of a product with its distinctive characteristics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Therefore, whether the term “Prosecco” was the name of a plant variety was simply a matter of objective fact. When the relevant inquiry was viewed in this light, the Consorzio’s argument that it was not clear how a Singapore court should decide which country or region to follow in determining whether “Prosecco” was recognised as the name of a grape variety lost any cogency.

The Italian Ministerial Decree of 17 July 2009 referred to “the synonym ‘Glera’ for the vine variety of ‘Prosecco’”. Thus, the renaming of the grape to “Glera” was neither contradictory nor mutually exclusive with the grape being known as “Prosecco”. The same grape could be, and was, known by more than one name. There was a wealth of evidence which showed that “Prosecco” <span class="font-italic">remained </span>the name of a grape variety outside the EU as at the Relevant Date. In particular, wine merchants in Singapore referred to “Prosecco” as a grape variety. On the evidence before me, I accepted that “Prosecco” was indeed the name of a grape variety at the Relevant Date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Consorzio’s contention to the contrary was premised on the assertion that that “Prosecco” was <span class="font-italic">not </span>recognised by the Singapore consumer as a grape variety, but instead as a GI designating wines from Italy only. I have explained at [17]–[21] why an objective approach, and not a subjective one, was to be used to decide this factual issue. In any event, the Consorzio’s assertion here was not supported by evidence. As counsel for the Consorzio acknowledged during the hearing, no market test was carried out to ascertain whether Singapore consumers recognised “Prosecco” to be a grape variety, and there was no concrete evidence of Singapore consumers perceiving “Prosecco” as a GI designating wines from Italy only. Instead, counsel for the Consorzio essentially urged me to <span class="font-italic">infer</span> consumer perception from the presence of Italian “Prosecco” from 2010 in the Singapore market, and wine traders’ trade advertisements and labelling of their products.

For a period of at least four years before the Relevant Date, consumers in Singapore had been exposed to “Prosecco” wines from Australia as well as from the Specified Region in Italy, but (based on export volume) this exposure did not appear to be very intensive (PAR’s Full Grounds at [51]–[55]).

</div> First, no evidence had been lodged to show that consumers had actually been misled, although Australian “Prosecco” wines had been sold alongside Italian “Prosecco” wines from the Specified Region for at least four years in Singapore before the Relevant Date. Second, because the distinctions made between the goods concerned (wines to be imbibed) were often matters of consumer preference, consumers were likely to pay a relatively high degree of attention to the purchase of such goods, and this reduced the likelihood of consumers being misled as to their origin. Third, it was industry practice in Singapore for the wines concerned to be marketed with accompanying descriptions of the relevant grape variety and region of production. The PAR further found that consumers were unlikely to be misled into thinking that a bottle of Italian “Prosecco” came from Australia or <span class="font-italic">vice versa </span>(PAR’s Full Grounds at [64]).

However, as at the Relevant Date, the “Prosecco” grape variety had left the Specified Region and was being cultivated in significant and commercial quantities in other countries (such as Australia) for wine-making purposes. As “Prosecco” was also the name of a plant variety, and since the “Prosecco” plant variety was being cultivated and produced in commercial quantities outside the Specified Region, the Application GI was likely to mislead consumers who relied upon it as a badge of geographical origin into thinking that the true origin of “Prosecco” wines could only be the Specified Region, when this was in fact untrue.

Second, given the degree of recognition in Singapore of the Application GI and the reputation of the goods offered thereunder, as well as their nature (it being not uncommon for consumers of wines to pay great attention to their country of origin), the consumer in Singapore was not likely to be misled as to the true geographical origin of the product (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Italy).

This approach cohered with the “essential function” of a GI, which was “to guarantee to consumers the geographical origin of the goods and the specific qualities inherent in them”: <span class="font-italic">The Tea Board v European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) (Delta Lingerie intervening) </span>[2018] Bus LR 1095 at [56]. The very definition of a GI in s 2(1) of the GIA requires that the indication is “used in trade to identify goods as originating from a place”. Similarly, as explained during the Second Reading of the Geographical Indications Bill (Bill No 13 of 2014), GIs are “terms which we use to inform consumers that a product comes from a particular place” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official </span><span class="font-italic">Report </span>(14 April 2014) vol 91 (Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Education and Law)). A GI would therefore be misleading, and as such unregistrable, if the product could in fact come from a <span class="font-italic">different </span>place.

</div> but I was unable to accept this assertion. Even if Singapore consumers had a greater degree of exposure over a longer period of time to Italian “Prosecco” wines compared to Australian “Prosecco” wines, or might more commonly associate “Prosecco” wines with Italy, this did not mean that the Application GI was not likely to mislead consumers as to the true origin of “Prosecco” wines.

Conegliano and Valdobbiadene are both towns in the Veneto region of Italy. These indications were not liable to mislead consumers as to the true origin of the products they were used to designate, as (for example) “Conegliano – Prosecco” could indeed only originate from the town of Conegliano in Italy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 A related question was whether the “product” referred to in s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA should be interpreted as the particular class of products specified in the GI application (in this case, “Prosecco” wines originating from Italy), or the broader class of products to which the term sought to be registered as a GI was applied (in this case, all “Prosecco” wines). The Consorzio argued that the correct interpretation was the former.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A plain and ordinary reading of the subsection indicated otherwise. It reads, “a geographical indication which … is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product”: in context, the last word “product” is referred to directly as that bearing the “geographical indication” at the beginning of the sentence. The Consorzio’s reading put an additional gloss on the section. Further, it was a circular argument. On such a reading, the Application GI (which was sought to be registered in respect of wines originating from Italy), by definition, could not mislead the consumer as to the true origin of “Prosecco” wines <span class="font-italic">originating from Italy</span>. Instead, in my view, the “product” as to whose true origin consumers might be misled under s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA had to refer to the entire class of products to which the GI was to be applied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, all “Prosecco” wines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In its oral submissions, the Consorzio maintained its position on the basis that s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA referred to a “geographical indication”, which was defined in s 2(1) of the GIA. That argument, too, was circular. The issues for consideration within s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA were framed on the assumption that the indication being opposed under that same subsection was indeed a GI. The correct ground for contesting whether any GI fulfilled s 2(1) of the GIA was s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the GIA, which specifically mentions this ground of challenge (and which is dealt with below, at [43]–[56]). The relevant question framed by s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA was therefore whether, <span class="font-italic">if</span> the Application GI was not refused registration as a GI, the Application GI was likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin <span class="font-italic">of</span><span class="font-italic"> any wine marked as “Prosecco”</span>. This was the fundamental question if a geographical attribution was to have its proper meaning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The difficulty in the Consorzio’s argument is reflected in the PAR’s Full Grounds (at [64]–[65]), where, in assuming the same position as the Consorzio, she found that there was no confusion in the sale of Australian and Italian “Prosecco” because of consumer awareness and local industry practice in marking the two types of wines with accompanying descriptions of the relevant grape variety and region of production. However, the concurrent sale of Australian and Italian “Prosecco” defeats the purpose of “Prosecco” <span class="font-italic">as a geographical indication</span>. The very reason wine merchants use the differentiating markings, and consumers pay attention to such descriptions, is to avoid confusion as to product origin. In each case the merchants or customers realise the word “Prosecco” could refer to a grape variety, or more casually, as akin to a varietal wine. Concurrent use of the same GI in respect of different locations is not envisaged under the GIA. To the contrary, s 42 of the GIA permits the Registrar to impose various practical conditions when registering a geographical indication that is homonymous in relation to an earlier GI, so as to differentiate the homonymous GI from the earlier GI. And the protection afforded to GI-owners for wine extends further, beyond prohibiting confusion as to location of origin. Within both the 1999 GIA and the GIA, the use of geographical indications for wine is prohibited even in circumstances where the true geographical origin is clearly marked, used in translation, or accompanied by clarifying words such as “kind”, “style”, or “imitation”: see s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the 1999 GIA, and s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the GIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, in my judgment, the second limb of s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA was also satisfied. Accordingly, the registration of the Application GI ought to be refused under s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the GIA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 41(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) of the GIA</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn to the second main issue of the appeal, namely, whether the ground for refusal of registration in s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the GIA was established. I did not agree with AGWI on this ground. I deal with it briefly, as it was relevant to the issue of costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Section 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the GIA provides that indications which do not fall within the meaning of “geographical indication” as defined in s 2(1) of the GIA shall not be registered. Section 2(1) of the GIA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>— (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“geographical indication” means any indication used in trade to identify goods as originating from a place, provided that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the place is a qualifying country or a region or locality in a qualifying country; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the goods is essentially attributable that place;  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There was no dispute that the Specified Region in the Application GI was that of a region in a “qualifying country”. Italy has been a member of the WTO since 1 January 1995 and a party to the Paris Convention since 20 March 1883. AGWI’s opposition rested on two grounds: first, that the Application GI was not used in the course of trade to identify goods as originating from a place; and second, that the quality and reputation of the goods was not attributable to that place.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">PAR’s findings and parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The PAR found that the Application GI fell within the meaning of “geographical indication” under s 2(1) of the GIA.

AGWI contended that it had adduced unrebutted evidence that the qualities and other characteristics of “Prosecco” wines were, instead, owed to the underlying “Prosecco” grape variety.

AGWI’s interpretation of this head of s 2(1) of the GIA put an additional gloss on the words of the section. There was no reason to add the word “exclusively” into s 2(1), or to introduce into the section the perception of the Singaporean consumer. The sentence quoted from <span class="font-italic">Tea Board</span> at [56] was taken out of context. That portion of the judgment did not concern the EU Regulation which was similar to s 2(1) of the GIA, did not deal with the relevance of consumer perception in the definition of a GI, and does not aid statutory interpretation of s 2(1) of the GIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Returning to the statute, a plain reading of this first limb of s 2(1) of the GIA simply required that a GI be “<span class="font-italic">any</span> indication used in trade to identify goods as originating from a place”. On the available evidence, I agreed that “Prosecco” was an indication used in trade to identify wines originating from the Specified Region. The name “Prosecco” was protected as a GI as a matter of law within Italy and the EU. Its application also contained evidence that linked this GI to the Specified Region. Within the EU, this GI was used to verify its geographical source. Outside the EU, it was also valid as a GI in a range of other jurisdictions, either through trade agreements or through national registration. Therefore, it could not be said that the Application GI was not an “indication used in trade to identify goods as originating from a place”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Relevant to this issue was the Consorzio’s submission that sought to take this indication further in Singapore. The Consorzio contended that, in Singapore, prior to the implementation of the registration regime, the Application GI had been afforded protection as an unregistered GI, and the registration of the Application GI would correctly reflect the position prior to the date the registration regime was implemented, 1 April 2019. The Consorzio had not, however, sought remedies under the 1999 GIA. Whether the Application GI had been afforded protection as a GI prior to 1 April 2019 was therefore an untested question. There was no basis for this submission. The Consorzio did not dispute that the date that was relevant for the purposes of assessing the merits of AGWI’s opposition was the date of the filing of its application to register the Application GI.

</div> While the Consorzio also relied on its registration of a Singapore trade mark with “Prosecco PDO” within its mark, as I mention at [20], this protected a form of intellectual property that was distinct from a GI, and did not aid it in respect of its application to protect the Application GI.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Quality, reputation or other characteristic attributable to origin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The crucial issue in this case regarding s 41(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the GIA, in my view, was whether “a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the goods is essentially attributable to that place”, as required in limb (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the definition of a “geographical indication” in s 2(1) of the GIA. In making its application, the Consorzio adduced evidence to establish that the relevant characteristics of “Prosecco” wines were essentially attributable to the Specified Region in Northern Italy. AGWI contended that there was insufficient evidence in the Consorzio’s Application. A perusal of the relevant part of the Application included information on the special notes of the wine; linked its quality and reputation to requirements for the cultivation of the vine and making of the particular wine within the Specified Region; and detailed the cause-and-effect relationship of the grape variety with environmental factors such as climate and the alluvial soil of the Specified Region. In my view, these specified details were sufficient to sustain the Consorzio’s Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This did not mean, nevertheless, that the Application was not open to challenge. The relevant point was that AGWI bore the burden of proof in its opposition. Limb (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the definition of a “geographical indication” alludes to the European concept of <span class="font-italic">terroir</span>, where the assertion is that it is the particular climate, soil and terrain that is responsible for specific unique characteristics of the wine, and it is this that guarantees the special quality of the geographical attribution. Implicit in this criterion, and the Application, are at least two assertions that an opponent could challenge. These are, first, that the specified characteristics attach to the entirety of the Specified Region; and second, that the resulting product is not found elsewhere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 AGWI engaged with both ideas. AGWI contended that the Specified Region was too large a region. This submission was not sufficient on its own to prove the wider substantive point, without more, as the size of the stipulated terrain was not definitive. Rather, the specific question was whether, as a factual matter, the specified qualities were present throughout the Specified Region. While as a practical matter, regulation of a smaller area is easier than regulation of a larger one, as the Consorzio pointed out, “Champagne” covers a larger territory than the Specified Region. AGWI’s further contention was that the specified characteristics were only the result of the grape variety and not the result of the interaction of the soil, climate and terrain of the Specified Region.  The Monash Report made the assertion that a “breadth of different growing conditions arose with “differences in terrain and climate”, resulting in wines where “the common factor is the grape variety grown, and not the geographic location or method”.

</div> Relying on this, AGWI pointed to the lack of consistency in the terrain, climate and production methods in the Specified Region, and contended that the common factor to the product specified was solely attributable to the grape variety used. As part of its arguments, AGWI pointed generally to the significant quantities of Australian “Prosecco” exported to the Singapore market. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The fundamental weakness in AGWI’s case was that its arguments on this limb required expert factual evidence. Its case comprised various legal submissions and an article by legal academics, rather than specific factual evidence by wine experts as to the interaction of the “Prosecco” grape variety with elements of the Specified Region’s, or even Australian, <span class="font-italic">terroir</span>. Nor was there any expert analysis of the taste of the various wines resulting from the different locales. The success of exports of Australian “Prosecco” did not lead to any specific conclusion regarding any comparison of “Prosecco” from different terrain. Thus, there was no factual evidence to support AGWI’s assertion that the sole unifying factor in the wines in the market marked as “Prosecco” was their grape variety. Therefore, in my judgment, AGWI did not produce sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden of proof on this limb.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I therefore allowed the appeal on the basis of s 41(1)(f) of the GIA. Sections 41(1)(f) and 41(1)(a) of the GIA are disjunctive and independent grounds for the refusal of registration. Having regard to the specific circumstances, I agreed with the Consorzio that I should exercise my discretion to adopt an issues-based approach to costs. The portion of the costs of the appeal and the hearing before the PAR specific to s 41(1)(f) of the GIA were awarded to AGWI and fixed at $21,000.
