<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal concerns two charges brought against
                    the appellant, JS Metal Pte Ltd (“JS”), under the Gas Act
                    (Cap 116A, 2002 Rev Ed), namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     one charge under s 32A(2) of
                        damaging, in the course of carrying out earthworks between Block 319C
                        and Block 320B Sengkang East Way, a gas pipe in a gas pipeline network
                        owned by a gas transporter (<em>viz</em>,
                        SP PowerAssets Ltd); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     one charge under s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) of carrying out earthworks within the vicinity of the
                        aforesaid gas pipe (“the Gas Pipe”) without complying with all
                        reasonable requirements of the gas transporter for the prevention of damage
                        to the Gas Pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The offence under s 32A(2) of the
                    Gas Act (the “s 32A(2) offence”) is punishable with a fine
                    not exceeding $1m or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both
                    (see s 32A(2)), while the offence of contravening s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Gas Act (the “s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence”) is punishable with a fine not
                    exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both
                    (see s 32(7)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the first hearing in the District Court on
                    15 October 2010, JS, through its representative (one Mr Chen Hongtu),
                    pleaded guilty to both of the charges brought against it. The District Judge
                    hearing the case (“the DJ”) accordingly recorded a verdict of
                    guilty for both charges. Counsel for JS then tendered a written mitigation plea
                    for sentencing purposes. Counsel for the Prosecution, who was acting on a fiat
                    from the Public Prosecutor, made no submission on sentence. The DJ adjourned the
                    case to 29 October 2010 for further mention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The case came before another District Judge on
                    29 October 2010 and was adjourned to 12 November 2010, when the DJ
                    imposed a fine of $100,000 (with a warrant to levy to be issued in default of
                    payment) for the s 32A(2) offence and a fine of $10,000 (likewise with a
                    warrant to levy to be issued in default of payment) for the
                        s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence. In his minute sheet
                    for that hearing (<em>ie</em>, the hearing on
                    12 November 2010), the DJ did not record any reasons for his decision on
                    sentence. JS appealed against both of the sentences imposed. The DJ then
                    provided his written grounds of decision (<em>viz</em>,
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v J S Metal Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGDC 541 (“the GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The sole issue in the present appeal is whether
                    the sentences imposed on JS are manifestly excessive. Notably, there are no
                    sentencing precedents for the two offences committed by JS. However, after the
                    DJ pronounced his decision on sentence on 12 November 2010, three
                    subsequent cases involving (<em>inter alia</em>) the
                    s 32A(2) offence were dealt with by the District Court. In each of those
                    cases, the offender concerned was likewise fined $100,000 for that offence. As
                    those three subsequent cases are clearly not sentencing precedents, I will
                    disregard them in deciding this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In order to determine whether the sentences
                    imposed by the DJ are manifestly excessive, I will first review the facts of
                    this case, and then consider the nature and the gravity of the offences
                    committed by JS against the backdrop of Parliament’s intention in
                    prescribing a range of punishments (as set out at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) for the s 32A(2) offence and the
                        s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       JS was the main contractor for a project
                    commissioned by Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang Town Council for the construction of a
                    covered linkway for Sengkang West Division. The contract was a relatively small
                    one: its value was $182,500, and JS’s expected gross profit margin was
                    between 10% and 12%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the statement of facts admitted to
                    by JS at the hearing on 15 October 2010 (“the Statement of
                    Facts”), on 13 February 2009, JS, as required under
                        s 32(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Gas Act, submitted a
                    Notice of Commencement of Earthworks to SP PowerGrid Ltd
                    (“SPPG”), which manages Singapore’s electricity and gas
                    transmission and distribution networks (SPPG is the management company of
                    SP PowerAssets Ltd). In response, SPPG sent a letter dated 13 February
                    2009 stipulating several requirements to be complied with by JS in carrying out
                    the earthworks so as to prevent damage to any gas pipe in the vicinity of the
                    work site (“the Work Site”). One of these requirements was that JS
                    was to ascertain the location of any low-pressure gas pipe at the Work Site by
                    digging trial holes <em>manually</em> (referred to
                    hereafter as “the manual digging requirement” for convenience). In
                    this regard, SPPG stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The gas plans [provided by SPPG] indicate [the]
                            approximate location of the low pressure gas pipes. Exact location of
                            the low pressure gas pipe[s] shall be determined by means of trial
                            holes. Trial holes shall be carried out manually. Mechanical equipment
                            shall NOT be used in digging of trial holes except for the initial
                            breaking of the road surface</em>. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the earthworks were not required to be
                    supervised by either SPPG or an approved supervisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       JS subcontracted the preliminary work of
                    detecting underground services at the Work Site, such as telecommunication
                    cables, electricity cables, gas pipes, water pipes and sewer pipes, to a company
                    called Dynamach. In order to conduct the underground detection exercise,
                    Dynamach obtained gas plans from SPPG (“the Gas Plans”), which
                    gave the approximate locations of the gas pipes at the Work Site. Dynamach then
                    drew a to-scale drawing which plotted the predicted path of (<em>inter alia</em>) the Gas Pipe (<em>ie</em>,
                    where it entered and where it exited the Work Site) by overlaying the Gas Plans
                    onto that drawing (“the Dynamach drawing”). Dynamach carried out
                    this exercise because low-pressure gas pipes are made of polyvinyl chloride
                    (PVC) and are therefore undetectable by cable detection equipment (such
                    equipment can only detect metallic objects). The Dynamach drawing also included
                    the locations of other cables and pipes at the Work Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Under the contract for the construction of the
                    covered linkway, JS had to construct six footings for the linkway. This made it
                    necessary for JS to dig trial holes at the Work Site to determine the exact
                    location and direction of the Gas Pipe. To this end, JS dug several trial holes
                    within the Work Site. At the<sup></sup>seventh trial hole, it was determined that the Gas Pipe would exit
                    the Work Site at the northern part. Up to that point, the path of the Gas Pipe
                    conformed to the predicted path indicated on the Gas Plans. As JS was not
                    allowed to dig trial holes outside the Work Site, it could only rely on the Gas
                    Plans to project the path of the Gas Pipe. The predicted path of the Gas Pipe
                    showed that the pipe, after exiting the Work Site at the seventh trial hole,
                    would veer slightly to the right. There was no indication that the Gas Pipe
                    would re-enter the Work Site again somewhere to the south.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As it turned out, very unfortunately for JS,
                    the Gas Pipe turned sharply eastward after exiting the Work Site at the seventh
                    trial hole and entered the Work Site again at the area where the damage to the
                    Gas Pipe occurred. At the material time, JS’s workers (“R”
                    and “N”) were digging the eighth trial hole at that area to
                    construct the last footing for the covered linkway. JS had given R and N
                    permission to use a mechanical clawed-bucket to dig the eighth trial hole based
                    on the indication from the Dynamach drawing that there was no gas pipe under the
                    ground at that area. In this regard, counsel for JS emphasised that JS had
                    relied on the Dynamach drawing, which had, up to that point, correctly projected
                    the path of the Gas Pipe. However, it is necessary to add that whatever JS might
                    have thought, it could and should have dug the<sup></sup>eighth trial hole manually as required by SPPG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     According to the Statement of Facts, when R
                    had excavated a pit approximately 1m deep at the eighth trial hole, N saw an
                    orange slab within the pit. Suspecting that a gas pipe might have been damaged,
                    N told R to stop the excavation immediately. R stopped work and reported the
                    matter to his supervisor. SPPG’s emergency response standby officer was
                    then activated by its customer service centre to attend to the matter. It was
                    later confirmed that the Gas Pipe (described in the Statement of Facts as
                    “a 63 mm, Low Pressure A, Polyethylene gas pipe [located] at a
                    depth of 1 metre”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    had been damaged. According to the Statement of Facts, the Gas Pipe was part of
                    the gas distribution network between the regulator at the junction of Anchorvale
                    Link and Anchorvale Drive and the gas service isolation valve at Block 320B
                    Anchorvale Link, which served residents of nearby flats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It was evident from the Statement of Facts
                    that the damage to the Gas Pipe was relatively minor. It did not cause any
                    interruption of gas supply to the residential flats in the vicinity, and the
                    cost of repairing the damage, which was paid for by JS, came up to only $968. It
                    was not disputed that the Gas Pipe was not severed. Indeed, the photographs
                    produced to this court of the Gas Pipe after it was damaged showed that the Gas
                    Pipe was only very slightly bent and was temporarily repaired by what appeared
                    to be masking tape.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s reasons for his decision on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), the DJ imposed fines of $10,000 and
                    $100,000 for, respectively, the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    offence and the s 32A(2) offence (in both instances, with a warrant to levy
                    to be issued in default of payment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The DJ gave the following reasons for his
                    decision (see [16]–[24] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>… Sentence for the offence in EMA 2/10
                            [ie, the s 32(3)(a) offence]</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    Firstly, it would
                            be useful to understand the purpose of section 32 of the Gas Act
                            … The statutory predecessor of section 32 of the Gas Act
                            … is section 96A of the Public Utilities Act (Cap 261,
                            1996 Rev Ed). [It should be noted that the DJ referred to the wrong
                            statutory provision in this regard. He should have cited s 96A of
                            the Public Utilities Act (Cap 261, <em>1990</em> Rev Ed) instead as that was the provision
                            which was the subject matter of the ministerial speech which he
                            proceeded to quote from in the next sentence. Besides, there is
                                <em>no</em> s 96A in the Public Utilities
                            Act (Cap 261, <em>1996</em> Rev Ed)
                            (“the 1996 Public Utilities Act”).] During the Second
                            Reading of the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill [<em>ie</em>, the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1991
                            (Bill 20 of 1991)], the then Minister for Trade and Industry,
                            BG Lee Hsien Loong, had this to say on the proposed
                            section 96A (Singapore Parliamentary Debates (29 Jul 1991)
                            vol 58 at column 283):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“To curb the damage of water and gas pipes by contractors, a
                            new section 96A makes it compulsory for contractors to determine
                            the location of water and gas pipes before carrying out earthworks. At
                            present, there is no requirement for contractors to determine the
                            presence of such pipes before they start work. In 1990, there were 289
                            cases of damage to water pipes by errant contractors, and 102 cases of
                            damage to gas pipes. <em>The cost of such damage is
                                considerable, especially if we take into consideration the
                                consequent disruption to supply</em>.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    The gravity with which Parliament viewed the
                            various offences under section 32 [of the Gas Act] is reflected by
                            the punishment prescribed for them [<em>ie</em>, a
                            fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
                            five years or both] … It is also trite that in assessing the
                            appropriate sentence, I must take note of the maximum penalty, and for
                            the purposes of the present charge [<em>ie</em>,
                            the charge under s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) of the
                            Gas Act], the maximum fine is $100,000/-. I then must apply my mind to
                            determine where the conduct of JS … falls within the spectrum of
                            punishment devised by Parliament. I must bear in mind that the sentence
                            ha[s] to be proportionate not only in relation to culpability but also
                            in the context of the legislative scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    It is not disputed that the excavation work for
                            the last linkway footing between [B]locks 319C and 320B, Sengkang
                            East Way on 1 Apr 2009 falls within the definition of
                            “earthworks” in the Gas Act. It is not disputed that the
                            said earthwork[s] had damaged a 63 mm, low pressure A
                            Polyethylene gas pipe at a depth of one metre. It is not disputed
                            that in permitting the carrying out of the earthwork[s], JS had failed
                            to comply with the [manual digging] requirement …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    In my opinion, this case did not fall into the
                            category of the worst type of cases falling within the prohibition set
                            out in section 32(3)(a) of the Gas Act. <em>There is
                                no allegation that JS had deliberately flouted the requirement. In
                                fact, at its highest, the non-compliance was due to
                                negligence</em>. However, I cannot ignore the fact that there
                            was a marked absence of diligence in the manner [in which] the
                            earthwork[s] had been carried out. The pipes could not be detected by
                            using cable detection devices because they were made of PVC. As such, JS
                            had to predict the path of the gas pipes by overlaying the [G]as [P]lans
                            onto the construction drawings [<em>ie</em>, the
                            Dynamach drawing]. As JS had been expressly warned that the [G]as
                            [P]lans only indicated the approximate locations of the pipes, it was
                            imperative that their exact locations be obtained through digging trial
                            holes manually. This was to ensure that extreme care and caution could
                            be exercised during the digging process in order to avoid damaging the
                            gas pipes. Unfortunately this was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    Therefore, I could not agree that a nominal fine
                            would be appropriate having regard to the degree of [JS]’s
                            culpability. Also, imposition of a nominal fine would have merely
                            papered over the statutory scheme of punishment that Parliament has
                            designed. As such, I imposed a fine of $10,000/-.</p>

                            Electricity Act makes a distinction between damage caused to a
                            low-voltage cable and damage caused to a high-voltage cable. That this
                            was the express intention of Parliament could be seen from the speech of
                            the then Minister for Trade and Industry, BG George Yeo, during the
                            Second Reading of the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill [<em>ie</em>, the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1999

                            more precise, the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1999 led to,

                            s 95A, which were collectively the predecessors of what are now
                            s 79, s 80 and s 85 of the Electricity Act.] The Minister
                            said:</p>

                            differentiate the requirements for earthworks in the vicinity of
                            low-voltage electricity cables from those in the vicinity of
                            high-voltage electricity cables.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A new section 95A is proposed to require PowerGrid Ltd, which is

                            together to prevent damage to cables. This new section will regulate
                            earthworks and cable detection works within the vicinity of any
                            high-voltage electricity cable which belongs to or which is under the
                            management or control of a public electricity licensee. Offenders face a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    Parliament had deliberately made a distinction
                            between high-voltage cables and low-voltage cables. It had enhanced the
                            fine in section 107(3) [of the 1996 Public Utilities Act,] which
                            was the predecessor [albeit in the context of damage to high-voltage
                            electricity cables, as opposed to damage to gas pipes] of
                            section 32A(2) [of the Gas Act,] from $200,000 to $1 million.
                            This was to remove any incentive in running the risk of damaging a
                            high-voltage cable. In the Gas Act, there is no distinction made between
                            a high pressure gas pipe and a low pressure gas pipe. There is also
                            nothing in the Parliamentary Debates that showed an intention to
                            differentiate between the two. In the absence of such an intention, we
                            would have to conclude that Parliament had intended that
                            section 32A(2) of the Gas Act is applicable to both low pressure
                            and high pressure gas pipes. On these bases, I would not be able to
                            agree with [JS]’s submission that a ceiling of $10,000 should be
                            placed for damage to a low pressure gas pipe and that the
                            $1 million ceiling should only be applicable for damage to a high
                            pressure gas pipe. This is certainly not what Parliament had
                            intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    
              <em>Lastly, there is also no
                                evidence to [support] [JS]’s contention that damage to a high
                                pressure gas pipe is more serious and would lead to more dire
                                consequences than damage to a low pressure gas
                            pipe</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.    On that note, I then determined the appropriate
                            sentence. The fact that the maximum fine prescribed for an offence under
                            section 32A(2) is $1 million showed the gravity with which
                            Parliament intended the offence to be viewed. <em>This
                                severe penalty is necessary because, as far as Parliament is
                                concerned, damage to any gas pipe – whether high pressure or
                                low pressure – would have serious consequences</em>. I
                            must take note of this maximum penalty and then I must apply my mind to
                            determine where JS’s conduct fall[s] within this legislative
                            scheme of punishment. Applying these considerations, and having regard
                            to the discussion in [19] above, and the fact that no disruption in
                            supply of gas was occasioned and that JS had paid the repair cost of
                            $968, I was of the opinion that this case did not fall into one of the
                            worst type[s] of case that warranted a high fine. At the same time a
                            nominal fine as suggested by [counsel for JS] would not be appropriate.
                            As such, I imposed a fine of $100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It can be seen from [17] of the GD that the DJ, in imposing a fine
                    of $10,000 for the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence,
                    regarded the prescribed maximum fine of $100,000 under s 32(7) of the Gas
                    Act as indicative of the gravity with which Parliament viewed the various
                    offences under s 32 of the Gas Act. He also found that there was no
                    allegation that JS had deliberately flouted the manual digging requirement, and
                    that JS’s non-compliance with that requirement amounted, at its highest,
                    to negligence or lack of diligence on JS’s part (see [19] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With regard to the s 32A(2) offence, the
                    DJ held that because the maximum fine prescribed for that offence was $1m, and
                    because Parliament had not made any distinction between damaging a low-pressure
                    gas pipe and damaging a high-pressure gas pipe, Parliament took the view that
                    damaging either type of gas pipe “would have serious consequences”
                    (see [24] of the GD). For this reason,
                    the DJ imposed a fine of $100,000, notwithstanding the fact that the damage to
                    the Gas Pipe was relatively minor as it cost only $968 to repair and did not
                    result in any interruption of gas supply to consumers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The fines imposed by the DJ work out to 10% of
                    the maximum fines for the respective offences under the Gas Act. In my view,
                    although the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence committed by
                    JS was of a relatively minor nature (in that JS breached the manual digging
                    requirement in respect of only one of the trial holes dug at the Work Site), the
                    fine of $10,000 for that offence is defensible as a deterrent punishment for
                    contractors who fail to comply with SPPG’s directions while carrying out
                    earthworks in the vicinity of any gas plant or gas pipe. In contrast, it seems
                    to me that the fine of $100,000 for JS’s s 32A(2) offence is, even on
                    a deterrent basis, staggeringly punitive in absolute terms, given the very
                    slight damage to the Gas Pipe. Furthermore, as the DJ himself found, JS had
                    merely been negligent, and not deliberate or reckless, in causing damage to the
                    Gas Pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the $100,000 fine for the s 32A(2) offence is manifestly
                excessive</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assessment of the DJ’s approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Leaving aside for the moment the sentence
                    imposed by the DJ for the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence
                    committed by JS, I will first deal with the $100,000 fine imposed for JS’s
                    s 32A(2) offence. In my view, the DJ’s approach to sentencing is,
                    with respect, wholly unsustainable: it is mechanical, and is also based on a
                    misunderstanding of the relevant legislative materials. The DJ’s premise
                    that Parliament is of the view that “damage to <em>any</em> gas pipe –
                    <em>whether high pressure or low pressure</em> –
                    would have serious consequences” [emphasis added] (see [24] of the GD) is clearly wrong. It is not
                    supported by any ministerial speech and is contrary to the structure of the
                    prescribed punishments in s 32A(2), which range from (<em>inter alia</em>) a fine of a nominal sum (<em>eg</em>, $1) to a maximum fine of $1m. This structure is inconsistent
                    with the DJ’s approach, which rests on the basis that <em>every</em> s 32A(2) offence <em>must</em>
                    be punished with a substantial fine (or even a custodial sentence) to deter
                    contractors from damaging any gas pipe or gas plant in the course of carrying
                    out earthworks, whatever the actual damage caused in the particular case at hand
                    might be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In my view, this approach is not justified for
                    several reasons. Firstly, s 32A(2) of the Gas Act penalises earthworks that
                    may cause different kinds and/or different degrees of damage to gas plants and
                    gas pipes, ranging from damage which can lead to serious social or economic
                    losses (<em>eg</em>, destruction of a gas plant, leading to
                    widespread power outage across the country) to, at the other end of the
                    spectrum, damage which may merely inconvenience gas consumers (<em>eg</em>, temporary disruption of gas supply) and/or SPPG (in
                    terms of having to repair the damage, as in the present case). A deterrent
                    punishment is justifiable if the damage in a particular case causes serious or
                    “catastrophic consequences to human lives, property and our
                    economy” (<em>per</em> Mr S Iswaran,
                    Minister of State for Trade and Industry, at the second reading of the Gas
                    (Amendment) Bill 2007 (Bill 18 of 2007) (“the Gas (Amendment) Bill
                    2007”) (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (21 May 2007) vol 83 (“<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (vol 83)”) at
                    col 755)), but not in a case where the punishment would be wholly
                    disproportionate to the actual damage caused. It is difficult to contemplate
                    that Parliament intended that a contractor should be punished with a deterrent
                    fine of $1m in the worst case of causing damage to a <em>low</em>-pressure gas pipe when that same amount is also the maximum
                    fine for causing damage to a <em>high</em>-pressure gas
                    pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, the DJ acknowledged that neither the
                    s 32A(2) offence nor the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    offence committed by JS fell within “the worst type of case that
                    warranted a high fine” (see [24]
                    of the GD; see also [19] thereof). He
                    thus imposed fines that were equivalent to 10% of the maximum fines prescribed
                    for these two offences. Whilst a fine of 10% of the maximum fine which may be
                    imposed for an offence may not, at first blush, seem excessive, this punishment
                    takes on a completely different complexion when it is translated into JS having
                    to pay a fine of $100,000 (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    s 32A(2) offence) for doing nothing more than damaging a low-pressure gas
                    pipe, which damage: (a) was not caused deliberately or recklessly;
                    (b) cost only $968 to repair; and (c) did not result in any
                    interruption of gas supply to consumers. In my view, the DJ failed to appreciate
                    that the prescribed maximum punishment for the s 32A(2) offence (<em>ie</em>, a fine of $1m coupled with five years’
                    imprisonment) is intended to deter offenders from causing, in the course of
                    carrying out earthworks, damage to gas pipes or gas plants which may lead to
                    serious economic losses due to widespread disruption of power supply, and/or
                    which may lead to injury to persons or loss of life and property due to
                    explosions or fires resulting from the ignition of leaking gas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The DJ’s mechanical and technical
                    approach to sentencing is also evident from his rejection of the argument by
                    JS’s counsel that the court should evaluate the gravity of the
                    s 32A(2) offence committed by JS and impose an appropriate punishment by
                    reference to the analogous offence under the Electricity Act (Cap 89A,
                    2002 Rev Ed) of damaging an electricity cable (see [21]–[22] of the GD). The DJ rejected that argument on the ground
                    that the Electricity Act expressly prescribed a lower maximum fine for damaging
                    a low-voltage electricity cable than that for damaging a high-voltage
                    electricity cable (<em>viz</em>, a maximum fine of $10,000
                    as compared to a maximum fine of $1m (see, respectively, s 85(1) and
                    s 85(2) of the Electricity Act)), whereas the Gas Act made no such express
                    distinction. This fact also appeared to have led the DJ into mistakenly finding
                    that Parliament intended, via s 32A(2) of the Gas Act, to punish offenders
                    severely for damaging <em>any</em> kind of gas pipe while
                    carrying out earthworks. In fact, as will be seen from the relevant
                    parliamentary materials (at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>–<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> below), that
                    was not Parliament’s intention at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     During the hearing of this appeal, counsel for
                    the respondent was asked about the potential dangers or consequences which could
                    have resulted from the kind of damage that was caused to the Gas Pipe so as to
                    warrant the fine of $100,000 imposed by the DJ for the s 32A(2) offence.
                    Her response was that Parliament intended that a deterrent sentence should be
                    imposed for all s 32A(2) offences, irrespective of the actual damage
                    caused. In my view, this proposition finds no support from either the
                    ministerial speech at the second reading of the Gas (Amendment) Bill 2007
                        (<em>viz</em>, the Bill introducing, <em>inter alia</em>, the provision which is now s 32A(2) of the Gas
                    Act) or s 32A(2) itself. Furthermore, Parliament’s omission to
                    expressly distinguish between damage to a low-pressure gas pipe and damage to a
                    high-pressure gas pipe (unlike the distinction drawn in ss 85(1) and 85(2)
                    of the Electricity Act between damage to a low-voltage electricity cable and
                    damage to a high-voltage electricity cable) is not an indication to the court
                    that it should treat any damage to a low-pressure gas pipe as being equivalent
                    to damage to a high-pressure gas pipe, such that the worst-case scenario apropos
                    damage to a low-pressure gas pipe would invariably warrant the imposition of the
                    maximum fine of $1m. It is a well-established principle of statutory
                    construction that where Parliament has not prescribed a mandatory punishment for
                    an offence but has merely prescribed <em>a range of
                        punishments</em> for that offence, the court has full power and
                    discretion to calibrate the punishment to fit the crime. In the present case, if
                    Parliament had intended that <em>any</em> s 32A(2)
                    offence, whatever its nature or consequence might be, must be punished with a
                    fine of at least $100,000, it would have provided for a minimum mandatory
                    sentence, just as it has done with respect to many other offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The difference in consequences between damaging a high-pressure gas
                pipe and damaging a low-pressure gas pipe</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At the request of this court for information
                    on “[t]he difference between [damage to] high pressure and low pressure
                    gas pipes in terms of potential damage to the economy”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> counsel for the respondent stated that damage
                    to a high-pressure gas pipe would have a much bigger impact (as compared to
                    damage to a low-pressure gas pipe) in terms of potential detriment to the
                    economy. According to counsel, this is because damage to a high-pressure gas
                    pipe will cause a supply interruption that affects a wider area and a larger
                    number of customers, given that high-pressure gas pipes form the “trunk
                        mains”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> that supply gas to low-pressure gas
                    pipes. Notably, power generation plants, which are served by high-pressure gas
                    pipes, will be affected if these gas pipes are damaged, and electricity outage
                    may result in various parts of Singapore. In contrast, when a low-pressure gas
                    pipe is damaged, the affected customers are usually concentrated at specific
                    locations in the vicinity of the damaged gas pipe. Supply interruption may also
                    occur, but at a lower magnitude than that in the case of damage to a
                    high-pressure gas pipe. Unlike the situation when a high-pressure gas pipe is
                    damaged (as just mentioned, such damage will affect gas supply to low-pressure
                    gas pipes), when a low-pressure gas pipe is damaged, gas supply to high-pressure
                    gas pipes will not be affected. A point to note here is that low-pressure gas
                    pipes supply gas to not only domestic customers, but also commercial customers
                    (such as hospitals, the airport, the integrated resorts, food courts and coffee
                    shops) as well as industrial customers (such as factories).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Counsel for the respondent highlighted that
                    the scale of the impact which damage to a gas pipe might have would ultimately
                    depend on the location of the gas pipe in question and the number of gas
                    consumers in the area affected by the damage. For instance, damage to a
                    low-pressure gas pipe serving the airport or the integrated resorts will have a
                    greater impact than damage to a gas pipe serving a residential estate. Gas
                    leakage will also occur when a gas pipe is damaged, which, in turn, may lead to
                    a fire or an explosion. This risk is present regardless of whether the damaged
                    gas pipe is a low-pressure or a high-pressure one. The difference would only be
                    in terms of the scale of the hazard, with damage to a high-pressure gas pipe
                    presenting a much greater risk to life and property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the respondent also informed the
                    court that the gas supply grid in Singapore is designed and built with
                    interconnecting networks, such that “customers are supplied [with] gas
                    from ‘ring’ networks which provide alternative supplies in events
                    such as damage, unless the damage is at [the] point of the solitary feed pipe
                    going into the customer’s premises”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Hence, when
                    asked by the court about the number of customers that would have been affected
                    by the loss of gas supply in the present case if there had been an interruption
                    of gas supply (as mentioned at, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above, there was in fact no
                    interruption of gas supply in this case), counsel for the respondent stated that
                    it was not possible to link the damage to the Gas Pipe to the number of
                    customers that would have been affected, given the alternate feeds put in place
                    by the interconnecting networks in our gas supply grid. However, counsel also
                    pointed out that in the event of damage to a gas pipe, manpower would need to be
                    deployed to shut and to turn on segments of the gas pipeline network to provide
                    gas supply via alternative feeds. In this regard, if a bypass of the damaged
                    pipe were required, additional temporary pipes would have to be laid, and the
                    lead time needed to do so would depend on the scale of the bypass.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The above information shows that damage to a
                    low-pressure gas pipe may inconvenience SPPG more than consumers (especially
                    domestic consumers, as in the present case), in that SPPG will have to deploy
                    manpower to carry out the necessary work to ensure that gas is supplied via
                    alternate feeds to affected consumers. Damage to a low-pressure gas pipe may, of
                    course, have more serious consequences in the <em>specific
                        instance</em> where the damage is at the point of the solitary feed
                    pipe entering an affected customer’s premises. But, this was not the case
                    here, as can be seen from the fact that the damage to the Gas Pipe did not cause
                    any interruption of gas supply. Given these considerations, it is necessary to
                    examine whether there are any other factors (apart from those outlined at
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) that can justify the fine of $100,000 imposed by the
                    DJ for the s 32A(2) offence. To this end, I now turn my attention to the
                    legislative intention behind s 32A and also s 32 of the Gas
                    Act.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Sections 32 and 32A of the Gas Act were
                    enacted by s 14 of the Gas (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 24 of 2007)

                    14 February 2008. They were not the primary focus of the Gas (Amendment)
                    Act 2007, which was intended to restructure the gas industry in Singapore
                    “by separating the contestable sectors of the gas industry from the
                    ownership of the gas transportation business” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (vol 83) at col 749).
                    In connection with this restructuring, new provisions were also enacted to
                    safeguard our critical gas infrastructure because (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (vol 83) at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The gas pipeline network is the only means by which gas is transported to
                        key end users, like the power generation companies and pharmaceutical

                1991)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At [16] of the GD (reproduced at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above), the DJ, to support his view on the purpose of
                    s 32 of the Gas Act, referred to the parliamentary speech made by the
                    Minister for Trade and Industry on 29 July 1991 at the second reading of
                    the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1991 (Bill 20 of 1991) (“the
                    Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1991”), which was subsequently enacted
                    as the Public Utilities (Amendment) Act 1991 (Act 28 of 1991).
                    Section 13 of that Act introduced into the Public Utilities Act
                    (Cap 261, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the 1990 Public Utilities Act”)
                    a new s 96A setting out a duty to enquire into the location of any mains,
                    cables or pipes before carrying out any excavation work using mechanical
                    equipment or explosives (referred to hereafter as “the duty to enquire
                    before excavation”), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>96A</b>.—(1) No person shall dig,
                        bore, trench, grade, excavate or break any ground with any mechanical
                        equipment or explosives or allow his servant or agent to do so without first
                        ascertaining the location of any main, cable or pipe belonging to or under
                        the management or control of the [Public Utilities] Board that may be
                        interfered with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any person who fails to comply with or contravenes
                            subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Breach of that duty was punishable under s 98 of the 1990
                    Public Utilities Act with a fine not exceeding $5,000 (and, in the case of a
                    continuing offence, with a further fine not exceeding $250 for each day or part
                    thereof while the offence continued). The remarks made by the Minister for Trade
                    and Industry at the second reading of the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill
                    1991, which the DJ referred to at [16]
                    of the GD, were clearly not directed at the potential problems which might
                    currently arise in relation to damage to gas plants or gas pipes caused by
                    earthworks undertaken negligently or recklessly by contractors. Instead, the
                    enactment of s 96A of the 1990 Public Utilities Act was intended to remedy
                    the mischief of contractors being able to carry out earthworks without having to
                    first find out where the gas pipes (if any) at the work site were, which
                    mischief had led to widespread damage to gas pipes as a result of contractors
                    using mechanical means to conduct earthworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The duty to enquire before excavation under
                    s 96A of the 1990 Public Utilities Act was later reproduced in s 96A
                    of the Public Utilities Act (Cap 261, 1992 Rev Ed) (“the 1992
                    Public Utilities Act”) and, subsequently, s 117 of the Public
                    Utilities Act (Cap 261, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the 1996 Public
                    Utilities Act”). Section 98 of the 1992 Public Utilities Act
                    retained the same punishment for breach of that duty as the punishment set out
                    in s 98 of the 1990 Public Utilities Act, whereas s 119 of the 1996
                    Public Utilities Act enhanced the punishment to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both (likewise, in the case
                    of a continuing offence, with a further fine not exceeding $250 for each day or
                    part thereof while the offence continued).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The aforesaid duty was similarly retained in
                    the Gas Act 2001 (Act 11 of 2001) (“the 2001 Gas Act”), the
                    immediate predecessor of the Gas Act, but it has since been superseded by
                    s 32 of the Gas Act, which imposes far wider duties on contractors
                    intending to carry out earthworks in the vicinity of any gas plant or gas pipe.
                    Such contractors must now (<em>inter alia</em>) notify SPPG
                    in writing at least seven days in advance before carrying out the earthworks
                    (see s 32(1)(<em>a</em>)) as well as comply, during
                    the course of the earthworks, with the conditions laid down by SPPG for the
                    prevention of damage to the gas plant or gas pipe concerned (see
                        s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)). Section 32 of the Gas
                    Act came into effect on 14 February 2008, some 16.5 years after the duty to
                    enquire before excavation was first enacted via s 96A of the 1990 Public
                    Utilities Act. The punishment for an offence under s 32 of the Gas Act
                        (<em>viz</em>, a fine not exceeding $100,000 or
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both (see s 32(7)) is
                    much more severe than the punishment for breaching the duty to enquire before
                    excavation (see s 98 of the 1990 Public Utilities Act, s 98 of the
                    1992 Public Utilities Act, s 119 of the 1996 Public Utilities Act and
                    s 32(1) of the 2001 Gas Act). Obviously, either the imposition of the duty
                    to enquire before excavation was not effective to remedy the mischief of
                    contractors carrying out earthworks without first ascertaining the locations of
                    gas plants or gas pipes in the vicinity of the area of work, or there was some
                    other reason for the enactment of ss 32 and 32A of the Gas Act. In my view,
                    the former inference is the more plausible inference to draw.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The current regime under the Gas Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Sections 32 and 32A of the Gas Act
                    provide a regulatory regime to prevent earthworks from causing damage to any gas
                    plant or gas pipe by empowering the gas transporter (here, SPPG) to give
                    permission to contractors to carry out earthworks subject to certain conditions.
                    A failure to comply with all reasonable requirements imposed by SPPG is an
                    offence punishable under s 32(7) with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. The wilful or reckless
                    damaging, destruction or removal of any gas plant or gas pipe is an offence
                    under s 32A(1), and is punishable with a fine not exceeding $1m or
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. Section 32A(2),
                    on the other hand, specifically targets the act of <em>damaging</em> a gas plant or gas pipe <em>in the
                        course of carrying out earthworks</em>. The s 32A(2) offence is
                    punishable with the same punishment as that for the offence under s 32A(1)
                    (the “s 32A(1) offence”). The s 32A(2) offence is a
                    strict liability offence (<em>cf</em> the s 32A(1)
                    offence), and the only defence available is that set out in s 32A(4),
                        <em>viz</em>, the offender has “[taken] all
                    reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission
                    of the offence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The combined effect of ss 32 and 32A of
                    the Gas Act shows that Parliament’s main concern in enacting these two
                    provisions (see in this regard <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> (vol 83) at cols 749–756) was to ensure
                    the reliability and security of the supply of gas from gas terminals to gas
                    plants and power generation plants and, in turn, to all consumers, whether
                    industrial, commercial or domestic. Obviously, damaging or destroying a gas
                    plant or a high-pressure gas pipe that supplies gas to a power generation plant
                    will cause great damage to the economy and may even lead to “catastrophic
                    consequences to human lives, property and our economy” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (vol 83) at
                    col 755). On the other hand, it is apparent that damaging a low-pressure
                    gas pipe will not cause that kind of damage since, as counsel for the respondent
                    informed the court, low-pressure gas pipes are not used to supply gas to power
                    generation plants (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above). In fact,
                    damaging a low-pressure gas pipe may not even cause any interruption of gas
                    supply to consumers (whether commercial, industrial or domestic) in most cases
                    because of the interconnecting networks in our gas supply grid (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Given the range of possible damage and
                    consequences that can result from damage to a gas plant or gas pipe, it would be
                    wholly consistent with the legislative intention behind s 32A(2) of the Gas
                    Act to punish an offender according to the extent of the damage caused by him to
                    the gas plant or gas pipe in question. In this regard, it bears emphasis that
                    Parliament has not prescribed a mandatory minimum punishment for the
                    s 32A(2) offence, but has instead prescribed (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) a fine which may range from a nominal sum (<em>eg</em>, $1) to a maximum of $1m. Accordingly, the court must
                    determine, in accordance with long-established sentencing practices and
                    principles, the punishment that is appropriate in the light of the nature and
                    the gravity of the offending act in question. In other words, the court must
                    differentiate between different instances of the s 32A(2) offence based on,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the nature or type of offending
                    act which constituted the offence, the gravity of the offence in terms of the
                    harm or damage caused to society, the degree of culpability of the offender and
                    all other relevant considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     None of the above considerations was taken
                    into account by the DJ in determining the appropriate fine to be imposed for the
                    s 32A(2) offence committed by JS. The DJ focused exclusively on the need
                    for deterrence on the basis that the prescribed maximum fine of $1m under
                    s 32A(2) of the Gas Act had the element of a deterrent punishment,
                        <em>viz</em>, he reasoned that the prescribed maximum
                    fine of $1m was intended to be a deterrent punishment, and, therefore, every
                    s 32A(2) offence must be punished with a deterrent sentence, irrespective
                    of the extent of the offender’s culpability and the actual damage caused.
                    While deterrence has a useful role in our penal system, judges should not be
                    over-zealous in invoking this sentencing principle when it is uncalled for, as
                    the court may otherwise be seen to be acting oppressively. In the present case,
                    no evidence was adduced of the incidence of s 32A(2) offences or of any
                    loss to SPPG which might warrant the imposition of a deterrent sentence on JS,
                    neither did counsel for the respondent seek a deterrent sentence at the hearing
                    before the DJ (in fact, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>
                    above, the respondent’s counsel did not make any submission on sentence at
                    all in the court below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This was the first prosecution under
                    s 32A(2) of the Gas Act since that provision came into force on
                    14 February 2008. There were a number of mitigating factors in the present
                    case, namely: (a) the damage to the Gas Pipe was relatively minor;
                    (b) the damage was not caused deliberately or recklessly; (c) no
                    consumer was inconvenienced; and (d) although SPPG was inconvenienced (in
                    that it had to despatch its emergency response standby officer to attend to the
                    damage (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above)), JS paid for the
                    cost of repairing the damage. For the above reasons, I am of the view that the
                    fine of $100,000 for the s 32A(2) offence committed by JS is wholly
                    disproportionate and manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How the s 32A(2) offence should be punished: analogy with
                sections 85(1) and 85(2) of the Electricity Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my view, in determining the appropriate
                    punishment for s 32A(2) offences, the most useful and appropriate analogy
                    to refer to would be the punishment for offences involving damage to electricity
                    cables. Both electricity and gas are forms of power. Electricity is supplied by
                    electricity cables which are either high-voltage cables or low-voltage cables.
                    Similarly, gas is supplied by either high-pressure gas pipes or low-pressure gas
                    pipes. The same security and economic factors apply equally to the supply of
                    electricity and the supply of gas. Accordingly, the range of punishments
                    prescribed by ss 85(1) and 85(2) of the Electricity Act for offences
                    relating to damage to electricity cables is an appropriate guide for the
                    punishment to be imposed under s 32A of the Gas Act for offences relating
                    to damage to gas pipes which cause similar degrees and/or kinds of
                    damage.</p>

                        Report</em> (18 August 1999) vol 70 at

<em>Power Dips &amp; Cable Damage</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Feedback from industry indicates that companies, particularly those in
                        high-tech industries which rely heavily on sensitive computerised control
                        systems, have been adversely affected by voltage dips in their power supply.
                        Voltage dips, unlike power outages or blackouts, are momentary reductions of
                        the voltage levels in the power supply system, which can disrupt the
                        functions of sensitive computerised control systems.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Voltage dips occur some 25–30 times a year. They have a severe
                        impact on some industries, particularly high-tech, process industries like
                        the wafer fabrication industry. According to the Economic Development Board
                        (EDB), voltage dip-related losses suffered by five high-tech companies
                        between August 1997 and November 1998 amounted to some $3 million. This
                        figure does not include the cost of production downtime, labour and delayed
                        product deliveries. The production downtime can amount to as much as 10% of
                        the monthly output of a wafer fabrication company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 1998, 57% of voltage dip complaints arose because of cable damage.
                        Although the number of voltage dips caused by cable damage is relatively
                        small (5 out of 36 in 1996, 2 out of 21 in 1997 and 4 out of 30 in 1998),
                        the effect of such damage to high-voltage cables can be major. For Singapore
                        to continue to attract high-tech, knowledge-based activities like wafer
                        fabrication, we must ensure the high quality and reliability of our power
                        supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To minimise damage to high-voltage cables in the course of construction
                        work, section 95 of the Act [<em>ie</em>, the 1996
                        Public Utilities Act] will be amended to differentiate the requirements for
                        earthworks in the vicinity of low-voltage electricity cables from those in
                        the vicinity of high-voltage electricity cables.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A new section 95(A) [<em>sic</em>] is proposed
                        to require PowerGrid Ltd, which is the owner of high-voltage electricity
                        cables, and contractors to work together to prevent damage to cables. This
                        new section will regulate earthworks and cable detection work within the
                        vicinity of any high-voltage electricity cable which belongs to or which is
                        under the management or control of a public electricity licensee. Offenders
                        face a fine not exceeding $100,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
                        five years, or both fine and imprisonment, if they do not follow the
                        legislated procedures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The serious consequence to the economy as a result of
                            damage to high-voltage cables makes a severe penalty necessary. A
                            deterrent penalty of $1 million is therefore proposed for damage to
                            a high-voltage cable</em>. Section 107(3) [of the 1996 Public
                        Utilities Act] will be amended to enhance the current fine of $200,000 to
                        $1 million. The enhanced fine is the same as that provided under
                        [s 85(2) of] the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Act
                        [(Cap 323, 1993 Rev Ed) as amended by s 18(<em>b</em>) of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore
                        (Amendment) Act 1998 (Act 15 of 1998)] for damaging telephone cables.
                            <em>At the present level of penalty, some contractors are
                            tempted to risk hitting a cable rather than suffer project delay and
                            payment of liquidated damages. A fine of $1 million will deter such
                            irresponsible behaviour</em>. With the amendments, offenders will
                        face a maximum fine of $1 million, imprisonment for five years, or
                        both. The maximum five-year term of imprisonment for high-voltage cable
                        damage remains as before. At the same time, section 95 as amended will
                        reduce the maximum term of imprisonment for damaging a low[-]voltage cable
                        from three years to 12 months, as this is less serious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from a deterrent penalty, we will require reasonable precautions to
                        be taken against damage to high-voltage cables. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It can be seen from the above ministerial
                    speech that the regulatory regime for preventing damage to electricity cables by
                    earthworks is exactly the same as that for preventing damage to gas plants and
                    gas pipes by earthworks. In fact, the wording of s 32 and s 32A of the
                    Gas Act is substantially similar to that of s 80 and s 85 respectively
                    of the Electricity Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Under the Electricity Act, Parliament has made
                    a clear distinction between causing damage to a high-voltage electricity cable
                    and causing damage to a low-voltage electricity cable because the former will
                    result in greater harm than the latter. Accordingly, a deterrent fine of up to
                    $1m or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both has been
                    prescribed to punish offenders who damage high-voltage electricity cables in the
                    course of carrying out earthworks (see s 85(2) of the Electricity Act). In
                    contrast, damage to low-voltage electricity cables is punishable under
                    s 85(1) of the Electricity Act with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or
                    imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both. In my view, the
                    reasons given by the Minister for Trade and Industry in his parliamentary speech
                    at the second reading of the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill 1999 for
                    differentiating between damaging high-voltage electricity cables and damaging
                    low-voltage electricity cables as well as the legislative intention underlying
                    s 85(1) and s 85(2) of the Electricity Act are equally applicable to
                    s 32A(1) and s 32A(2) respectively of the Gas Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Therefore, in sentencing offenders for
                    s 32A(2) offences (and also s 32A(1) offences), the distinction made
                    in the Electricity Act between high-voltage electricity cables and low-voltage
                    electricity cables should similarly be applied to high-pressure gas pipes and
                    low-pressure gas pipes in the context of the Gas Act for the rather obvious
                    reason that damage caused by earthworks to a low-pressure gas pipe is ordinarily
                    much less serious than similar damage caused to a high-pressure gas pipe,
                    especially one that supplies gas to a gas plant, a power generation plant or
                    high-end manufacturing users.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How the s 32(3)(a) offence should be punished: analogy with
                section 80(4)(a) of the Electricity Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Section 32(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Gas Act is worded in similar terms as
                        s 80(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Electricity Act, on
                    which it is based (s 80(4)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Electricity Act relates to earthworks carried out in the vicinity of
                    high-voltage electricity cables). In <em>Public Prosecutor v Pay
                        Ah Heng Contractor Pte Ltd</em> [2006] SGMC 4 (“<em>Pay Ah Heng</em>”), the accused, a construction
                    company, pleaded guilty to one charge under s 80(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Electricity Act of failing to comply with all
                    reasonable requirements of SPPG (in its capacity as the electricity licensee)
                    for the prevention of damage to a high-voltage electricity cable in the vicinity
                    of which earthworks were being carried out. Under s 80(7) of the same Act,
                    this offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment
                    for a term not exceeding five years or both. The equivalent punishment provision
                    in the Gas Act <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                        s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence is
                    s 32(7).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Pay Ah Heng</em>,
                    the accused failed to comply with three out of 31 requirements imposed by SPPG.
                    The District Judge held that while the number of requirements breached was a
                    relevant consideration, what was more important was the nature of the
                    requirements that were not complied with, which requirements, if complied with,
                    would have averted the damage to the high-voltage electricity cable in question.
                    The District Judge found as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    Turning now to the extent of the failure to comply
                            with the requirements[,] [t]he recommendation by LCDW Soh [the
                            licensed cable detection worker engaged by the accused] to dig trial
                            holes to ascertain the presence or absence of high voltage cables, which
                            is a stipulated requirement by SPPG to do the same, was ignored and this
                            simple requirement was not undertaken. In addition, mechanical
                            excavation was used to conduct earthworks beyond the hard-core or premix
                            layer instead of manual excavation as required. Subsequently, after
                            encountering foreign objects in the course of excavation, the [accused]
                            did not seek the advice of SPPG but instead continued with the
                            mechanical excavation to remove these obstacles. The failure to comply
                            with these critical requirements resulted in damage to a high voltage
                            cable as well as a pilot cable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    As regards the extent of the damage caused, apart
                            from the damage to the cable which cost $7,179.39 to be repaired, there
                            was a power outage which lasted for about 1 hour 19 minutes
                            which affected seven residential homes and also businesses. Even for a
                            relatively short period of about an hour or so, the power outage would
                            have caused the affected parties inconvenience as well as costs to the
                            running of the businesses. However, the latter was not a factor that I
                            placed too much weight on as there was no evidence of the actual costs
                            suffered by the affected businesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The District Judge imposed a fine of $30,000 (with a warrant to
                    levy to be issued in default of payment). The accused appealed to the High Court
                    via Magistrate’s Appeal No 9 of 2006, but that appeal was later
                    deemed withdrawn pursuant to s 247(7) of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) as the accused failed to file its petition of
                    appeal within the prescribed time frame.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The accused in <em>Pay Ah
                        Heng</em> could have been charged with another offence, namely, that
                    under s 85(2) of the Electricity Act of damaging a high-voltage electricity
                    cable in the course of carrying out earthworks, which is punishable with a fine
                    not exceeding $1m or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.
                    This offence is equivalent to the s 32A(2) offence, which is punishable
                    with the same punishment. In the present case, JS, in addition to being charged
                    with the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence, was also charged
                    with the s 32A(2) offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     If one compares the sentence imposed in
                        <em>Pay Ah Heng</em> (<em>viz</em>, a fine of $30,000) with the sentence imposed by the DJ in the
                    present case (<em>viz</em>, a total fine of $110,000), it
                    would appear that the offence of damaging a high-voltage electricity cable is
                    regarded – incongruously – as less serious than the offence of
                    damaging a low-pressure gas pipe. Furthermore, as pointed out by counsel for JS,
                    since the s 32A(2) offence committed by JS flowed directly from the
                        s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence, it is arguable that
                    JS is being punished twice over for the consequences of the same failure to
                    comply with the manual digging requirement. The s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence and the s 32A(2) offence are intended to achieve
                    the same purpose (<em>ie</em>, to prevent damage to gas
                    plants and gas pipes from earthworks), even though they are distinct offences.
                    In the context of criminal legislation, it is not uncommon for the same criminal
                    act to give rise to two or more separate offences which are punishable
                    differently. Under the one transaction rule (which applies to punishment by way
                    of imprisonment), if an offender is convicted of two or more offences committed
                    in the course of a single transaction, the terms of imprisonment imposed for the
                    various offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive (see, <em>eg</em>, this court’s recent judgment in <em>Fricker Oliver v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another
                        matter</em> [2011] 1 SLR 84 at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, there is no reason why
                    the sentences for the s 32A(2) offence and the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence committed by JS should not be subject to the
                    principle underlying the one transaction rule (namely, that the punishment
                    imposed for an offence should be taken into account in determining the
                    punishment to be imposed for another offence committed in the course of the same
                    transaction) as it was precisely JS’s failure to comply with the manual
                    digging requirement that led to the damage to the Gas Pipe. If JS had complied
                    with that requirement in the present case, the Gas Pipe would most likely not
                    have been damaged at all. Of course, it is possible that the Gas Pipe would
                    still have been damaged even if JS had dug all the trial holes at the Work Site
                    manually as required by SPPG (<em>eg</em>, if JS’s
                    workers had been careless while digging the eighth trial hole by manual means).
                    In that scenario, however, the damage to the Gas Pipe would most likely have
                    been less serious or, at least, not more serious than the damage that actually
                    resulted here. Herein lies the irony – suppose JS had dug the eighth trial
                    hole manually and had caused the same damage to the Gas Pipe, would the court be
                    justified in imposing a fine of $100,000 for the s 32A(2) offence? If it
                    would not (which is my view), then why would such a hefty fine be justified just
                    because JS had used mechanical means to dig the eighth trial hole, given that JS
                    is also being punished for the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    offence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In my view, where non-compliance with
                    SPPG’s requirements in the course of carrying out earthworks (<em>ie</em>, the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    offence) results in damage to a gas pipe or gas plant (<em>ie</em>, the s 32A(2) offence), the proper approach to
                    sentencing for the two offences is to consider <em>both</em> offences together. If the damage resulting from the
                    s 32A(2) offence requires that offence to be punished more severely than
                    the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence, then the sentence
                    imposed for the s 32A(2) offence should be harsher than that imposed for
                    the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence. Conversely, if the
                    damage resulting from the s 32A(2) offence is relatively minor (as in the
                    present case), then the sentence imposed for the s 32A(2) offence should be
                    less severe than that imposed for the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On this basis, in the circumstances of this
                    case, the fine of $100,000 imposed by the DJ for the s 32A(2) offence was
                    manifestly excessive and disproportionate to the consequences of damaging the
                    Gas Pipe, which, as noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                    above), is a low-pressure gas pipe. In my view, given that JS is also being
                    fined $10,000 for the related s 32(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    offence, a fine of $5,000 for the s 32A(2) offence would be sufficient on
                    the facts of this case. As I stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above), the fine of $10,000 for the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence was not manifestly excessive when compared
                    with the fine of $30,000 imposed in <em>Pay Ah Heng</em>
                    for the analogous offence under s 80(4)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Electricity Act (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the above reasons, the fine of $10,000 for
                    the s 32(3)(<em>a</em>) offence is affirmed, but the
                    fine of $100,000 for the s 32A(2) offence is set aside and substituted with
                    a fine of $5,000. Thus, the aggregate fine for the two offences committed by JS
                    is $15,000. I direct that the excess amount paid by JS (based on the aggregate
                    fine imposed by the DJ) be refunded to JS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It appears that thus far, all the
                    s 32A(2) offences which have come before the courts have involved damage to
                    gas pipes which occurred in circumstances where the contractors concerned were
                    left to supervise their own earthworks. This suggests that if the earthworks in
                    those cases had been independently supervised, the offences would likely not
                    have been committed. As prevention is better than cure, an effective way of
                    preventing such incidents may well be to require independent supervision of all
                    earthworks in the vicinity of gas pipes.</p>
