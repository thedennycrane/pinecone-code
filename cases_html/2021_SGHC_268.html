Their love burned hot and fast, dying out before they could marry as they had vowed to do. This court is left to rake through the ashes to decide what belongs to each of them as they part ways. Without the benefit of matrimonial law to guide this exercise, it is property law to which we turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 It helps in answering the question of ownership that they exchanged reams of messages. At times, interpreting those messages presents something of a challenge, not so much because they were written in Chinese, and had to be translated for the court, but because they were written in the language of love: larded with vows, suffused with sacrifice and stirred from time to time by anger or resentment. Such language is not always easy to render into the dry language of property law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The story of their love is what has to be deciphered. Is it, as the defendant says, a classic tale of a lover who, having made lavish gifts as an expression of his love, is now seeking to claw them back?

</div> This led to Mr Lyu’s filing an application on 23 July 2021 to amend the relief sought by his statement of claim, with no change to the body of the pleading. After hearing parties on 30 August 2021, I allowed the bulk of these amendments and permitted Ms Wei’s counsel’s request to file a further round of submissions, limited to the changes made to the relief sought, with a final reply given to Mr Lyu’s counsel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Lyu’s case is that he had transferred moneys to Ms Wei so that they could build a life together in Singapore, with the D’Leedon apartment and the Car. These were not gifts and belonged to him, though Ms Wei had the benefit of being able to use them. He also contended that he later transferred additional moneys to her for the purpose of discharging the Bartley mortgage on the shared basis that they would marry. As they did not marry and she did not in fact discharge the Bartley mortgage, she had to return those moneys to him. Subsequently, at her request he transferred moneys for three projects, namely the Cairnhill option, the US surrogacy and the first clinic investment, all of which were not ultimately executed; therefore, Ms Wei had to return those moneys, or in the case of the Cairnhill option, account for the rental she received in subletting the property. Later, she asked him for financial help in connection with her application for Grenadian citizenship for herself and her children, and he contended that the money he transferred to her for this purpose was a loan that she had to repay. Then there was the Marne Road shop, in relation to which he claims a resulting trust in proportion to his contribution to its purchase. Finally, there was a second clinic investment that was mooted but did not materialise, and he seeks a refund of the moneys he transferred to her for that purpose. Mr Lyu also claims that Ms Wei unlawfully removed and retained a Rolex watch belonging to him, and seeks either the delivery up of the watch or a payment equal to its purchase price. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Mr Lyu’s case in essence is that these transfers were not made as gifts.

Briefly, a valid gift between living people is made where there is both the intention to gift, and delivery of the precise subject matter of the gift. Intention refers to the donor’s subjective intention, which must be assessed as of the time of the transfer. Once a gift has been made (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, delivery has been completed with the requisite intention), the donor cannot revoke the gift. There are however recognised grounds, such as undue influence, fraud or mistake, on the basis of which a gift may be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Presumed resulting trusts and common intention constructive trusts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 A presumed resulting trust comes into existence where a person transfers property or purchases it in the name of another who pays nothing for it, and without the intention to make a gift of it. The registered legal owner holds the property on trust for the benefit of the first person. The word “resulting” bears its older meaning of “springing back” – thus, although the legal title carries across, the beneficial interest springs back. It is the funder’s lack of intention to benefit the recipient that gives rise to the resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It follows that the court’s task, just as it is with gifts, is to discern the intention of the transferor from any direct evidence, <span class="font-italic">per</span> the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [52].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Where there is no direct evidence of the transferor’s intention, resort may be had to the rebuttable presumption of advancement, which traditionally has been relied on in the context of established patriarchal categories of protection, namely that of a husband for his wife and a father for his child, but in more modern times has been the subject of discussion for possible extension in favour of anyone for whom the person providing the funds is under a legal, equitable or possibly even moral obligation to care. While Ms Wei’s primary contention is that the evidence shows that Mr Lyu intended to make a gift of the moneys and properties to her, she also relies on the presumption of advancement.

If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arises).

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)?

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion.

In this particular case, the court may perhaps take quick steps for some part of the analysis, as it is now accepted that the funds came from Mr Lyu, while the assets were or are all in Ms Wei’s sole name as legal owner. Neither party has contended that there is any question of shared ownership of the beneficial interest of any particular asset. Either Mr Lyu gave the moneys or assets to Ms Wei or he did not.

I am not able to draw any inferences against either party from their absence, other than to proceed on the basis that there probably were no messages clearly favouring either party’s version. If there had been messages of significance clearly favouring either party’s version of events during that time, it is reasonably likely that that party would have saved those messages. Indeed, Ms Wei’s own evidence was that she saved screenshots of WeChat messages that were meaningful.

She did not admit to receiving moneys from Mr Lyu and claimed to have purchased the D’Leedon apartment with her own money. Mr Lyu’s counsel contends that Ms Wei always knew the assets were paid for by Mr Lyu, and consequently her allegations of gift are an afterthought,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, she never genuinely believed that they were gifts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I reject this last submission. A communication depends on what is said, and the context in which it is said. Its meaning is unaffected by some hidden and unarticulated thought. The argument struck me as rather like a child crossing his fingers behind his back to invalidate his spoken promise. I have no doubt that Ms Wei understood that she was not putting forward a defence of gift but rather falsely denying that she had received moneys from Mr Lyu for the purchase of the D’Leedon apartment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I accept that Ms Wei always knew that the money for the purchases came from Mr Lyu and hence her original position in these proceedings was, to her knowledge, false and misleading. However, this does not of itself lead ineluctably to the conclusion that her defence of gift is a mere afterthought and necessarily false. It is possible that she took a false position in the early stages of this litigation because of a concern that any defence of gift was just her word against his, and that it would be harder for Mr Lyu to prove that the money came from him. This shows a certain cynicism about telling the truth, which I must take into account in considering her testimony, but it does not of itself mean that the moneys were not in fact gifts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Ultimately, the question of who is telling the truth can be tested against the contemporaneous messages. I consider the WeChat messages in February and March 2017, when read as a whole, a generally illuminating window into Mr Lyu’s mindset. I find that Mr Lyu did not intend either the D’Leedon apartment or the Car to be outright gifts to Ms Wei. Rather, they were, to use his words, building blocks of their future life together. Having a big home that Ms Wei could live in and a fancy car that she could use would underpin their new life together. Their common future lay in Singapore and buying a home and car here expressed Mr Lyu’s commitment to that future. It did not mean that Ms Wei was intended to be the beneficial owner of them. That is why he said he “bought a house and car”, without adding the words “for you”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is true that he repeatedly expressed concerns about the amount of his available funds, especially at times when Ms Wei suggested new items of expenditure. However, this is perfectly consistent with his being concerned that his money was tied up in, among other things, the D’Leedon apartment. Of his assets, he had still to give about half to his wife as they divorced, while the vast bulk of the balance was sunk into the building blocks for his new life together with Ms Wei. It does not mean that he had given the D’Leedon apartment to Ms Wei.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I also find that at that relatively early stage of their relationship, Ms Wei too did not in fact believe that the D’Leedon apartment was a gift to her.

Sometimes, in order to read a document, he had to stand up and approach the screen on which the document was shown. For those moments, I was not able to observe his face. However, I was satisfied that these interruptions were momentary and that I had sufficient opportunity to observe him. He gave his evidence in a clear and logical way.

</div> I have not found it necessary to resolve this debate. It is true that in the context of the D’Leedon apartment Mr Lyu used the former phrase, but I do not find that that sheds any particular light, even if Mr Lyu were correct about what it meant. Much more important were the communications and actions of both parties at the material time, especially in the early months of 2017, taken as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Communications that happened much later, and especially from September 2018 onwards, when the relationship sharply deteriorated, are of much less probative value, both because the relationship was in flux and because of the parties’ often distraught emotional state. This includes Mr Lyu’s suggestion, made by a WeChat message sent in September 2018, that they enter a prenuptial agreement confirming joint and equal ownership of the moneys transferred and properties purchased.

This argument is misconceived. If one family member lends money to another, one cannot turn that into a gift (which is the effect of disallowing recovery of the loan) by relying on the family context. Further, the context of this expenditure is not truly familial, in the sense of any shared family with Mr Lyu. Ms Wei was not asking Mr Lyu for money for an expenditure in their shared home, but for a purpose that was not connected to their relationship, namely her desire for Grenadian citizenship for herself and her own children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I allow Mr Lyu’s claim for return of his RMB2,901,661.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: The Marne Road shop</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Ms Wei admitted that she used moneys transferred by Mr Lyu to pay some part of the purchase price for the Marne Road shop.
