        The accused is a 24 year old male Malaysian.

Before his arrest, he resided in Johor Baru but worked in Singapore as a maintenance

technician. He was tried and convicted on the following charge which carries the death

penalty.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE PROSECUTION’S CASE</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        On 7 March 2002, at about 12.45 am, the accused

drove JEK 682, a Honda car, from Johor Baru into the Woodlands Checkpoint. He was alone in

the car. He was stopped by CPL Yeo Kia Huat, one of the police officers who were

conducting a routine check at the arrival channel, and was asked to open the boot of the

Honda in the Customs Inspection Pit. The accused unlocked the boot and alighted from the

car to open the boot for inspection.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        When CPL Yeo lifted up the mat covering the

well of the spare tyre, he found four bundles covered with newspapers therein. When asked

in Mandarin what the bundles contained, the accused replied that he was not sure. CPL Yeo

then took out one bundle and instructed the accused to tear it open. The accused squatted

at the kerb and began to tear away the plastic wrapping. CPL Yeo noticed that the bundle

contained some granular substance and, suspecting it was controlled drugs, immediately

placed the accused under arrest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        Other police officers and two narcotics sniffer

dogs with their handlers were called to the scene. At about 1.25 am, the dog handlers

carried out a search of the Honda and the dogs reacted when they were at the right and the

left sides of the boot. The lining at the sides of the boot was then pulled off by the

police officers who found another four bundles, two behind the lining on the right side

and two behind the lining on the left. All this was done in the presence of the accused

who remained calm throughout.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        All the bundles were removed by the police

officers from the boot and placed on the kerb next to the Honda. Two officers stood guard

over the accused and the eight bundles.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        Insp (now ASP) Omer Ali Saifudeen of the

Central Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 2

am. He was briefed on the happenings by CPL Yeo. He then took over custody of the eight

bundles seized from the Honda. A further search on the Honda revealed nothing else.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The accused and the eight bundles were brought

to the CNB office while the police officers guarded the Honda. An Instant Urine Test on

the accused produced a negative result.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        At 2.50 am, ASP Omer recorded a statement from

the accused with CPL Francis Tan interpreting in Mandarin. The questions and answers

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The questions and the answers

were read back to the accused by CPL Francis Tan in Mandarin. The accused then signed in

the pocket book. He added that he had answered ‘drugs’ to question 2 as one of

the policemen had said that they were drugs. He said he did not know who that policeman

was. ASP Omer testified that the period of silence in question 6 was slightly over ten

seconds while CPL Francis Tan estimated it to be about 30 seconds. CPL Francis Tan was not

a certified interpreter of CNB but did obtain an A2 grade in his GCE ‘O’ level

examinations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Insp Saherly bin Limat of the Enforcement

Division of CNB, the investigating officer, arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 4

am and was briefed on the facts of the case by Insp Omer. He then took over custody of the

eight bundles from Insp Omer. When the Scene of Crime Unit arrived, Insp Saherly

instructed photographs to be taken of the Honda and the bundles seized. He then returned

to his office with the bundles and the accused’s passport while the accused was

brought to Alexandra Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        At around 8.35 am, the accused was escorted

into Insp Saherly’s office. The eight bundles seized earlier were then weighed in the

accused’s presence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        Between 9 am and 9.30 am, Insp Saherly recorded

a statement from the accused pursuant to section 122 (6) Criminal Procedure Code

("CPC"). This was done with the assistance of a certified Chinese interpreter.

The accused elected to speak in Mandarin. In that statement, the accused’s words were

        At about 3.05 pm that day, Insp Saherly

recorded a statement under section 121 CPC from the accused with the assistance of the

same Chinese interpreter. In that statement, which was admitted in evidence without

challenge, the accused said :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"I am known as "Ah

    Wei" to my family and friends. I have been working at Rubycon for almost 10 months.

    Previously, I was employed in a few other companies in Singapore. I started working in

    Singapore in the year 2000, after completing my studies. I studied at a Polytechnic in

    Kedah. The above given address is my old address. I have just shifted to a new rented

    house about four or five days ago. I can only remember the address as 50, Jln Mentega 5. I

    share this house with two of my cousins and one friend. My cousin’s girlfriend and my

    friend’s girlfriend also stays there. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

            On 6.3.2002, at about 11.30 am, "Tua

    Pui" came to my new house to look for me. I was alone at that time. He was with

    another male person. I do not know the male person. They came in a car. Tua Pui said that

    he needed my help. He wanted me to drive a car containing a package into Singapore when I

    am on my way to work. He did not tell me what the package contained. I did not agree to

    help him. However, I owe Tua Pui RM$2,000. He asked me to pay him the money if I do not

    help him. If I helped him, he would write off the RM$2,000 which I owe him. I told him I

    will think about it and give him an answer after I return from work. Tua Pui and his

    friend left after that. At about 2 pm, I left for work at Queenstown in Singapore. I went

    to work using my own motorcycle, JEJ 9405. I finished work at about 11 pm and went back to

    Johor. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

            Upon entering Johor, I called Tua Pui from a

    public phone at about 11.30 pm. His handphone number is 016-7552675. I asked him where he

    was so that I could collect the car from him. He told me that he will be waiting for me at

    "Mavesta" Apartments at Permas Jaya. I then proceeded to the said place. Upon

    reaching, I parked my motorcycle along the road outside the apartment. I saw Tua Pui

    inside the apartment compound. I then walked into the compound towards Tua Pui. I walked

    pass the security guardhouse. Tua Pui gave me one remote control with a car key. I am

    shown a brown coloured remote control and I confirm it to be the said one. (Accused was

    shown a brown coloured remote control with a car key earlier seized from him). Tua Pui

    also gave me a blue NOKIA handphone. He opened it to insert a SIM card and gave me another

    separate SIM card. He also keyed into the phone a number that I am supposed to contact

    upon reaching Singapore. I do not know the number. I am shown a blue NOKIA handphone and a

    separate SIM card and I confirm them to be the said items. (Accused was shown a blue NOKIA

    handphone containing one SIM card and a separate SIM card). He also gave me an Autopass

    card with JEK 682 written behind it, S$200 cash in 2 pieces of hundred dollar note. I am

    shown an Autopass with the words JEK 682 and 2 hundred dollar notes and I confirm them to

    be the said items. (Accused was shown an Autopass with the words JEK 682 and 2 hundred

    dollar notes). He then brought me to a Honda Accord parked in the compound. He instructed

    me to call his friend using the number given earlier upon entering Singapore. His friend

    would then meet me and take over the car. His friend will also help me get return to

    Johor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

            From the apartment, I drove to the Johor

    Immigration Checkpoint. I then crossed the causeway and entered the Woodlands Checkpoint.

    My car was stopped by the police and they did a check on my car. They recovered 4 bundles

    from the spare tyre compartment. They asked me to take out one of the bundles and open it.

    They then asked me what the bundles were. I answered that I do not know. They told me that

    the bundles contained "drugs". A further search was made using dogs. The police

    recovered another 4 bundles, 2 on the left boot compartment and another 2 on the right

    boot compartment. They were hidden behind the lining of the boot compartment. I was then

    brought into an office where my urine samples were taken. I was also asked some questions

    which I answered and these were written down. After that I witnessed the photo taking of

    the drugs and the car. I was then sent to a hospital for a checkup. After that, I was sent

    to another office where I was given a meal and my statement was recorded. I was then sent

    for another medical checkup and subsequently sent to a police lockup.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

            I have known Tua Pui for about 8 months. My

    friend introduced him to me. Sometimes we meet at coffeeshops to chat and drink coffee. In

    the last few months I got to know that Tua Pui also sells Ecstasy tablets. He also lends

    money to people. Just before the Chinese New Year, I borrowed RM$2,000 from him. I used

    the money for my Chinese New Year spending. He does not give me any receipt for the

    borrowed sum. He wrote it in his small book. I was supposed to collect my salary today,

    7.3.2002 and pay off part of my debt. However, he got hold of me earlier and made me pay

    for the debt by helping him drive the car in.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

            I wish to state that I had never seen the drugs

    before. When Tua Pui first approached me for help, I thought he wanted me to drive a car

    with a package containing Ecstasy."</font></p>

        The next day (8 March 2002), the exhibits were

brought to the Scene of Crime Unit for fingerprint dusting. Two prints were subsequently

developed from some of the exhibits but they did not match the accused’s

fingerprints. The contents of the eight bundles were analysed by the Centre for Forensic

Science, Health Sciences Authority and were found to contain not less than 327.59 grams of

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE CASE FOR THE ACCUSED</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        The accused grew up in Kedah but was residing

in Johor Baru at the time of his arrest. He has a diploma in mechanical engineering from

Kedah Polytechnic. At the material time, he was working on the afternoon shift in Rubycon

from 3 pm to 11 pm, travelling to and from Singapore on a motorcycle.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        He repeated in essence what he had said in the

statement quoted above. Tua Pui or Ah Pui was a loan shark. When Tua Pui gave him the

option of helping him to drive the car into Singapore or repaying him the RM2,000, the

accused did not have the money to repay the loan. He was afraid that if he did not pay Tua

Pui by night time on 6 March 2002, Tua Pui might kill him. Tua Pui had mentioned several

times before that he had caused those who did not repay their loans to be knocked down by

vehicles. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        At that time, the accused thought the packet

that was to be brought to Singapore in the car contained Ecstasy tablets. This was

because, in November 2001, when the accused was with Tua Pui in a coffeeshop, someone

telephoned Tua Pui and the accused was told by Tua Pui later that the caller was from

Singapore and wanted to purchase Ecstasy from him. The accused asked Tua Pui whether he

was afraid of the death penalty should he be arrested for selling Ecstasy. Tua Pui replied

that Ecstasy would not attract the death penalty under drug laws. The accused knew nothing

about drugs then and was not involved in the sale of drugs. He therefore believed what Tua

Pui had told him.</font></p>

        While at work on 6 March 2002, the accused

mulled over Tua Pui’s request for his help earlier that day. As he did not have the

RM2,000 to repay Tua Pui, he decided to agree to help him do the task. He reckoned that if

he was caught doing so, he would at the worst be imprisoned whereas he might well lose his

life that night if he refused to help Tua Pui. He did not think that bringing a packet of

Ecstasy into Singapore in a car would attract the death penalty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        At the Mavesta Apartments in Johor Baru where

the accused met Tua Pui at close to midnight on 6 March 2002, he asked Tua Pui whether the

packet in the car contained Ecstasy. Tua Pui said it was Ecstasy but told him he need not

know where the packet was kept. The accused then asked Tua Pui whether he was sure that

Ecstasy would not attract the death penalty and was re-assured by Tua Pui. The accused

testified that if he had known that the packet contained heroin, he would not have

undertaken the task of driving the car as he knew that dealing in heroin would attract the

death penalty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        At Woodlands Checkpoint, when the boot of the

car was opened and the accused saw four packets, he was shocked. He felt cheated as he had

been told there was only one packet. When he was told to open one of the packets and was

asked by the police officer what was in it, he replied that he did not know. He was then

told by the police officer that the packet contained drugs. He was handcuffed and made to

sit down on the kerb. He was asked to lower his head and not to look at the vehicles

passing by. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        When questioned by Insp Omer later, he could

not understand some of the questions and had to ask CPL Francis Tan to repeat himself. As

far as he could recall, he did pause before answering the questions but he did not think

there was any long pause.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        When he was later charged with trafficking in

heroin, he did not know what to say and therefore replied that he had nothing to say. He

had expected to be charged for selling Ecstasy and not for trafficking in heroin. He did

not dare to tell the recording officer that he thought the packet contained Ecstasy as he

was afraid that Tua Pui had also lied to him about Ecstasy not attracting the death

penalty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        In cross examination, the accused said he did

not tell CPL Yeo that the packet he was unwrapping was Ecstasy as he felt cheated and was

at a loss as to what to do. He had seen Ecstasy in photographs in newspapers before and

knew that it was in tablet form like Panadol tablets. The yellowish substance that was

like soil that he saw when unwrapping the packet did not look like Ecstasy to him. He did

not know what it was. Only one police officer said the bundles contained drugs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        When questioned by Insp Omer later in the

office, the accused did not say that the bundles contained Ecstasy as what he had seen was

not Ecstasy. He was not asked and therefore did not say anything about Tua Pui forcing him

to bring the drugs into Singapore. He also did not tell Insp Omer that there was supposed

to be only one packet as he did not have any witnesses or other proof and thought that no

one would believe him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

        The accused also explained that he did not

agree to Tua Pui’s request in the morning of 6 March 2002 as he believed that the

packet contained Ecstasy and he knew it was an illegal substance. He was the one who asked

Tua Pui for some time to think about his request but was given time instead to repay the

RM2,000. He could not borrow money from his relatives and his friends to repay Tua Pui on

6 March 2002 as he was alone in the house that day. In any event, he had tried borrowing

money from them before but was turned down. He therefore felt that he had no one to rely

on but himself. The RM2,000 that he had borrowed was to be repaid in six instalments of

RM400 each, totalling RM2,400. As of 6 March 2002, he had repaid only one instalment. He

was told by Tua Pui to repay the entire outstanding sum as he was late with the second

instalment by four days already then. He would have received over S$500 in salary on 7

March 2002 but could only afford to pay Tua Pui the interest for the four days he was

late, which was RM40 per day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        The accused said he did not seek help from the

authorities as Tua Pui had not done anything to him yet and he could not prove the threat

made against him. He did not want to leave Johor Baru as he did not wish to leave his job

in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27

        During the twenty to twenty five minute journey

from the Mavesta Apartments to the Johor Baru Checkpoint, the accused did not stop to look

for the packet in the car as he did not know where it was hidden. It did not occur to him

that Tua Pui would lie to him. He did not think the whole transaction that night was

suspicious. To him, it was a simple case of owing Tua Pui money and carrying out the task

asked of him in order to write off the debt. The S$200 handed over to him by Tua Pui was

meant to be handed over by him to the person taking possession of the Honda in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        The accused acknowledged that he was the author

of the note written essentially in Chinese. He wrote it during a rest period while at work

on 6 March 2002 because he had decided by then he would help Tua Pui drive the car into

Singapore, knowing he would be jailed if caught doing so. He had not committed any offence

before and did not know what to expect in prison. Prison was therefore like another world

to him. He disagreed that it was a suicide note written with the death penalty in mind. It

was not addressed to anyone in particular. He was upset as no one could help him and he

therefore wrote the note to express his feelings. He agreed that the note was related to

the task that he was going to undertake for Tua Pui and that he was not contemplating

suicide then. "Leaving this painful world" in the note meant going to jail.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act

("MDA") states that "except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an

offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a controlled drug". In <i>Abdul

Ra’uf bin Abdul Rahman v PP</i> <nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 683</nobr>, the Court of Appeal said (at

paragraph 26) :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"To establish an offence

    under s 7 of the (Misuse of Drugs) Act, the prosecution must show that the appellant

    imported the diamorphine into Singapore without prior authorisation under the Act or its

    regulations. It is settled law that the word ‘import’ should be given the same

    meaning as defined in s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1), namely, ‘to bring or

    cause to bring into Singapore by land, sea or air’. Since the importation of

    controlled drugs is not a strict liability offence, it is incumbent on the prosecution to

    show that the appellant knew or intended to bring the diamorphine into Singapore."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30        On

the evidence, it is clear that the act of unauthorised importation has been proved. The

accused was the driver of the Honda and was the only person in the car at the time of his

arrest. The drugs in question were found in the boot of the car. He brought the said drugs

into Singapore in the car. The only issue is whether he knew that what he was importing

into Singapore was diamorphine.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31        

Section 21 of the MDA provides :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"If any controlled drug is

    found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the

    possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the

    time being".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The diamorphine found in the

Honda is therefore presumed to be in possession of the accused. That brings into play the

presumption in section 18 (2) of the MDA which states :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Any person who is proved or

    presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is

    proved, be presumed to have known the nature of the drug".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is therefore incumbent on the

accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know that what he was

importing into Singapore was diamorphine. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32

        The accused failed to mention in his statements

that he had asked Tua Pui at the Mavesta Apartments whether the packet in the Honda

contained Ecstasy. He also did not say in his statements that he had asked Tua Pui whether

dealing in Ecstasy carried the death penalty. There was also no mention of any express or

implied threat by Tua Pui if he should refuse to do him the favour of driving the car into

Singapore and fail to discharge the debt by nightfall on 6 March 2002. There was no good

reason why he failed to disclose these material facts. Even if the accused could be

excused for not stating these material facts because he was not asked by Insp Omer, surely

there was no excuse for saying "I have nothing to say" when invited to make a

statement by Insp Saherly pursuant to section 122(6) CPC. These matters could not

therefore have been true.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33

        Even if he did ask Tua Pui about the contents

of the packet and was assured that it contained Ecstasy, the fact remains that he did not

bother to check the packet or even find out where it was hidden in the Honda. Ignorance is

a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of

examination (<i>Yeo Choon Huat v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 217</nobr> at paragraph 22). The accused

knew he was involved in an illegal transaction. He was dealing with a known drug peddler

who was also a loan shark who would stop at nothing to punish those who failed to keep

their obligations to repay loans. There was no reason at all to trust Tua Pui. He

intentionally turned a blind eye to the contents of the packet and could not now rely on

his professed lack of knowledge about the actual contents.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34

        The note in Chinese found on him was obviously

a farewell note to his family or his friends. He penned it at work on 6 March 2002 after

Tua Pui’s request earlier that morning and it was related to what he had decided to

do by then – drive the car with the packet into Singapore for Tua Pui. It clearly

contemplated an imminent death. He acknowledged in Court that he knew that trafficking in

diamorphine attracted the death penalty. It could only mean he knew the nature of the

drugs he was going to transport that night and that the drugs would be of such quantity as

would attract the death penalty. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        Further, when the first four bundles were

discovered at the Woodlands Checkpoint, the accused appeared calm. He did not seem

perturbed at all to see the number of packets nor the contents of at least one of them. He

remained calm even when the other four packets were subsequently discovered. He also said

absolutely nothing that would have been consistent with his present plea of innocence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        On the facts of this case, the accused has

failed to rebut the presumption in law that he knew the nature of the drug that he was

importing into Singapore. Indeed, the evidence shows that he knew very well that he was

importing diamorphine and that he would face the death penalty if caught but was quite

prepared to face the consequences for the reasons set out sadly in his ‘farewell

note’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        Counsel for the accused alluded to the possible

defence of duress provided in section 94 of the Penal Code in the light of the

accused’s testimony about having been coerced by Tua Pui into driving the Honda into

Singapore. The authorities show that such a defence is available only if the threats give

rise to reasonable fear of ‘instant death’ and only if the threats have been

‘imminent, persistent and extreme’ (<i>Wong Yoke Wah v PP</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 246</nobr>; <i>Teo

Hee Heng v PP</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 168</nobr>). Counsel for the accused conceded, quite correctly,

that even if the Court were to accept that the accused was coerced by Tua Pui to drive the

Honda into Singapore, the requirement of ‘instant death’ was not satisfied in

this case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        The Prosecution has therefore proved the charge

against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. I convicted the accused and sentenced him to

suffer death, the mandatory punishment under the MDA.</font></p>
