The Arbitration was administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (the “SIAC”) and conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (6th Edition, 1 August 2016) (the “SIAC Rules”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Partial Award was made on an application for early dismissal under Rule 29 of the SIAC Rules by the respondents in the Arbitration (the “AED”). A key question before the Tribunal was whether the claimants in the Arbitration (who were the borrowers and guarantors under a facility agreement) could rely on the doctrine of frustration (in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic) to escape their liabilities to repay moneys due under the facility agreement. The Tribunal decided that they could not and granted the AED.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 21 August 2023, we dismissed the application to set aside the Partial Award. The Applicants have appealed against our decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 26 February 2020, the 1st and 2nd Applicants and the 1st to 4th Respondents entered into a facility agreement (the “FA”). Pursuant to the FA, the 2nd to 4th Respondents (the “Lenders”) granted a term loan facility (the “Loan”) to the 1st and 2nd Applicants (the “Borrowers”). The 1st Respondent was the Agent and Security Agent (the “Agent”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The 3rd and 4th Applicants, and the 5th Respondent were the guarantors (together, the “Guarantors”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Borrowers’ obligations under the FA were secured by (among others) assignments, share pledges, powers of attorney and mortgages (the “Security”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Loan was taken for the purposes of a construction and development project in the Borrowers’ home country (the “Project”). The 2nd Applicant also owned, operated and managed a shopping mall, also located in the Borrower’s home country (the “Mall”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) struck. Throughout 2020, several control orders were issued by the relevant governmental authorities that restricted movement and business activities in the Borrowers’ home country. The Pandemic adversely affected the sales of units in the Project as well as the 2nd Applicant’s income from the Mall. The Borrowers claimed that consequently they were unable to repay the Loan when it matured on 26 March 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sometime in late 2021, the Agent and the Lenders took over the operation and control of the 5th Respondent. The Applicants’ position was that the Agent and the Lenders took over control of the 5th Respondent unlawfully.

Whether those facts could support the Arbitration Claimants’ case was a different matter altogether.

So as I understand it, the amendment which is sought to be made for the purposes of this application … I think the essence of it is that the parties were agreed, or agreed that the source of funds to service the interest was from the rental, and the source of the principal is the sale of the residences, and if that is the agreement that is being alleged, then for the purpose of this application we are happy to accept that you should proceed on that basis as well. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">CHAIRMAN: … Mr Gabriel has said these are the additional facts and changes that he would like to make to his pleadings … we are asking you whether you would agree that these facts, for the purposes of this application only, be deemed to be part of the claimants’ pleadings so as to dispense with the need for the formal amendment of the pleadings.

It was clear that the Arbitration Respondents only agreed to the Arbitration Claimants’ case on the Collateral Contract being deemed to be part of the pleadings without a formal amendment application. There was no basis for the Applicants’ submission that the Arbitration Respondents also agreed that the Collateral Contract should be assumed to exist. On the contrary, it must have been clear to the Arbitration Claimants that the existence of the Collateral Contract was disputed. Mr Patton had expressly stated that he did not accept that there was a contract collateral to the FA; in addition, his express denial of any agreement as to repayment only from specified sources of funds made it clear that the Arbitration Respondents did not agree that the existence of the alleged express term, condition, implied term, common assumption or Collateral Contract would be assumed (see [39] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Tribunal was bound to assume that the Collateral Contract existed </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Applicants submitted that the Tribunal was bound to assume that the Collateral Contract existed because the threshold under Rule 29.1 of the SIAC Rules was that of “manifestly without legal merit”.

</div>
</div> It bears emphasis that the factual premises supporting the existence of the alleged Collateral Contract were distinct from the existence of the Collateral Contract itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Applicants referred us to <span class="font-italic">CBS v CBP</span> [2021] 1 SLR 935 (“<span class="font-italic">CBS v CBP</span>”). In that case, a seller of coal assigned its trade debts to the appellant, a bank. The buyer refused to pay the bank for a shipment of coal, stating that (a) the full quantity of coal had not been delivered, and (b) there had been a subsequent agreement with the seller to pay less for the coal. The bank commenced an arbitration pursuant to the Rules of the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (3rd Ed, 2015) (the “SCMA Rules”). The buyer requested a hearing for witnesses to give evidence regarding the alleged agreement to reduce the price of the coal. The arbitrator directed the buyer to submit its proposed witness statements so that he could decide if they had substantive value before he would convene a hearing. The buyer refused and insisted on its right to call witnesses without such a condition. The arbitrator convened a hearing for oral submissions only and the buyer withdrew from further participation in the arbitration. The arbitrator allowed the bank’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision setting aside the award for breach of natural justice. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that under the SCMA Rules, where a party requested a hearing of oral evidence from witnesses, the tribunal was obliged to allow it (subject to certain limits) and could not decide to convene a hearing only for oral submissions (at [54]–[55]). The Court of Appeal found that the arbitrator’s denial of the entirety of the witness evidence from the buyer constituted a breach of natural justice (at [79]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 During oral submissions, the Applicants submitted that the present case was similar to <span class="font-italic">CBS v CBP</span> in that the hearing of the AED was based on legal submissions and the Arbitration Claimants were denied the opportunity to adduce witness testimony. We rejected the Applicants’ submission. In <span class="font-italic">CBS v CBP</span>, the buyer had requested a hearing for witnesses to give evidence on what transpired at a meeting at which it was alleged there was a subsequent agreement to reduce the price of the coal. In other words, the underlying facts supporting the alleged subsequent agreement were in dispute. The present case was very different. The Tribunal’s conclusion and reasons did not depend on any disputed underlying facts; the Tribunal assumed the underlying facts as pleaded (see [24] above). There was no necessity for witness testimony to prove the underlying facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We were also of the view that in any event, even if the “manifestly without legal merit” threshold under Rule 29.1 of the SIAC Rules required the Tribunal to assume that the Collateral Contract existed, the Tribunal’s failure to do so would have been an error of law, which was not a ground to set aside the Partial Award. It is trite that errors of law <span class="font-italic">per se </span>would not amount to a breach of natural justice (<span class="font-italic">BLC and others v BLB and another</span> [2014] 4 SLR 79 at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Tribunal acted in breach of natural justice and/or in excess of jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, the court may set aside the award of the arbitral tribunal if a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced. Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law also provides that the award may be set aside on the basis that the party was unable to present his case. These two bases (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law) are coextensive (see <span class="font-italic">ADG v ADI </span>[2014] 3 SLR 481 at [118]; <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another</span> [2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”) at [86]–[104]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the Applicants to make out their case that there had been a breach of natural justice, they had to establish which rule of natural justice was breached, how that rule was breached, in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award, and how the breach prejudiced their rights (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>”) at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There are two pillars of natural justice: the first is that the arbitrator must be disinterested and unbiased; the second is that parties must be given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard (<span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [43]). The right to be heard requires each party to have a “full opportunity” to present its case, subject to considerations of reasonableness and fairness. The result is that what constitutes a “full opportunity” is a contextual inquiry of whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair, and the approach a court should take is to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done: <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [104].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Scope of parties’ submission to arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law, the court can set aside the award if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 To establish a breach of Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii), a two-stage enquiry should be undertaken (<span class="font-italic">CRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</span> [2011] 4 SLR 305 at [30] (“<span class="font-italic">CRW Joint Operation</span>”)). First, the ascertainment of the matters that were within the scope of submission to arbitration. Second, whether the award touched on such matters, or whether it fell outside the scope of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CRW Joint Operation </span>at [33], there is a crucial distinction between the erroneous exercise by an arbitral tribunal of an available power vested in it (which would amount to no more than a mere error of law) and the purported exercise by the arbitral tribunal of a power which it did not possess. Only in the latter situation would an arbitral award be liable to be set aside. This is because an issue that is within the scope of submission to arbitration does not go outside the scope simply because the arbitral tribunal comes to a wrong conclusion on it (<span class="font-italic">Quarella</span><span class="font-italic"> SpA v Scelta Marble Australia Pty Ltd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1057 at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Tribunal’s finding that there was no factual substratum for the Collateral Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In para 233 of the Partial Award, the Tribunal said:

The 1st Respondent was the Agent and Security Agent (the “Agent”). The 3rd and 4th Applicants, and the 5th Respondent were the guarantors (together, the “Guarantors”). The Loan was for the construction and development project in the Borrowers’ home country (the “Project”). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in several control orders that adversely affected the sales of units in the Project and the 2nd Applicant’s income from a shopping mall (the “Mall”) that it owned, operated and managed. The Borrowers were unable to repay the Loan when it matured. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The FA included an agreement providing for disputes to be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (6th Edition, 1 August 2016) (the “SIAC Rules”), with the arbitral seat in Singapore. Parties proceeded to arbitration. The Arbitration Claimants, comprising the Borrowers and Guarantors, claimed that the FA was discharged by frustration. Their case was based on the allegation that there was an express term, condition, implied term and/or common assumption that the payment under the FA was to be made from specific sources of funds (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sales of the units in the Project and/or income from the Mall). The Arbitration Respondents, comprising the Agent and Lenders, denied that the FA was frustrated and counterclaimed against the Arbitration Claimants. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The Arbitration Respondents filed an application for early dismissal (“AED”) under Rule 29 of the SIAC Rules seeking a dismissal of the Arbitration Claimants’ claim that the FA had been discharged by frustration. During the hearing on the AED, the Arbitration Claimants sought to amend their pleadings for the purposes of the AED to include a pleading that there was a collateral contract that the funds for repaying the amounts due under the FA would come from the sales of units in the Project and income from the Mall (the “Collateral Contract”). The Arbitration Respondents did not object to the amendment. The arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) delivered its partial award (the “Partial Award”), allowing the AED on the basis that the Arbitration Claimants’ argument that the FA had been discharged by frustration was “manifestly without legal merit”. Amongst others, the Tribunal found that the Collateral Contract could not be made out by the facts relied on by the Arbitration Claimants in their pleadings. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The Applicants subsequently applied to the General Division of the High Court to set aside the Partial Award, and the application was then transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court. The Applicants’ case was that the Tribunal acted in breach of natural justice and/or acted in excess of jurisdiction. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Applicants’ case was based on the following arguments. First, the Tribunal had failed to assume the existence of the Collateral Contract despite: (a) having proceeded with the hearing on the basis that it would be assumed that the Collateral Contract existed, and the Arbitration Respondents having acknowledged that the hearing would proceed on this basis; and/or (b) the Arbitration Respondents having agreed to assume the truth of the case that repayment of the FA would only be from the proceeds of rental from the Mall and sale of units in the Project. Second, the Tribunal had failed to assume the existence of the Collateral Contract despite the Tribunal being bound to assume the existence of the Collateral Contract. Third, the Tribunal should not have decided that the Arbitration Claimants’ case on the Collateral Contract was manifestly without legal merit when the existence of the Collateral Contract was in dispute. Fourth, the Tribunal should not have decided that the doctrine of frustration did not apply when the applicability of that doctrine involved a legal controversy. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 There was nothing to suggest that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that it would be assumed that the Collateral Contract existed or that the Arbitration Respondents acknowledged that the hearing would proceed on this basis. There was also nothing to suggest that the Arbitration Respondents agreed to assume the truth of the case that repayment of the FA would only be from the proceeds of rental and sale. The Tribunal only assumed that the pleaded facts relied on by the Arbitration Claimants to prove their case on the alleged express term, condition, implied term, common assumption and/or Collateral Contract were true. The statements by the Tribunal and counsel for the Arbitration Respondents had to be looked at in its proper context. Counsel for the Arbitration Claimants also acknowledged the distinction between the Collateral Contract and the facts that establish the existence of the agreement: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">30]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">42]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Tribunal was not bound to assume the existence of the Collateral Contract; it only had to assume the existence of the facts alleged in support of the contention that the Collateral Contract existed. In any event, even if the Tribunal was bound to assume that the Collateral Contract existed, it would be an error of law which was not a ground to set aside the Partial Award: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[44] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[48]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The Applicants’ case that the Tribunal’s finding that there was no factual substratum for the Collateral Contract was in breach of natural justice or in excess of its jurisdiction, was predicated on the submissions that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that it would be assumed that the Collateral Contract existed, and the Arbitration Respondents acknowledged that the hearing would proceed on this basis; and/or the Tribunal was bound to assume that the Collateral Contract existed. As both of these submissions were rejected, the Applicants’ case failed on this ground:  at <span class="font-weight-bold">[56] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[57]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The Arbitration Claimants were not deprived of their right to present their case because of the Tribunal’s summary dismissal of their claim. They were permitted to amend their statement of claim to include the pleading on the Collateral Contract without a formal application to amend, and they had every opportunity to argue their case based on the alleged Collateral Contract: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[58] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The Tribunal did not act in excess of jurisdiction by not assuming the existence of the Collateral Contract and granting an early dismissal despite the existence of the Collateral Contract being a disputed fact. The Tribunal was not bound to assume the existence of the Collateral Contract and could dismiss the Collateral Contract claim because the claim was legally unsustainable: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[60]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The Applicants’ submission was essentially that they disagreed with the Tribunal’s application of the “manifestly without legal merit” test to the facts of the case. This was not a ground for challenging the Partial Award: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[62]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The fact that there were conflicting authorities on whether the FA could be discharged by frustration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic did not mean that the Tribunal could not decide (at the stage of the AED) that the Arbitration Claimants’ case on frustration was manifestly without legal merit. In any event, this would have been an error of law, which was not a ground for setting aside the Partial Award: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[65]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Not granting the Arbitration Claimants the opportunity to make their submissions with reference to evidence and/or witness testimony taken at a full hearing did not give rise to a breach of natural justice because the Tribunal had proceeded on the basis that the underlying pleaded facts by the Arbitration Claimants were true, and there was no reason for further evidence at a full hearing: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[47] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
