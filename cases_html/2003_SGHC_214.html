<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">‘This stretch of Yio Chu Kang Road is for the exclusive use by MINDEF and as such your proposed second access to be taken from this road is not supported.’</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">On 10 July 1995 Archispace wrote to MINDEF asking them to consider allowing emergency access through Old Yio Chu Kang Road for the Civil Defence fire engines should the need arises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They received a reply dated 19 July 1995 saying that -</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">‘we are in no position to allocate the subject land and you are advised to approach Land Office for the allocation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Old Yio Chu Kang Road is also shared by other users and permission from PWD is necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We are not managing the road which falls on State land.’</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Archispace then forwarded MINDEF’s letter of 19 July to the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The architects told the plaintiffs that they could not understand why the Old Yio Chu Kang Road could not be used for emergency access when it was ‘shared by others’.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> About a year later with nothing significant transpiring between the plaintiffs and the defendants in the interim, the plaintiffs wrote to Archispace enquiring whether their clients (the defendants) were ‘still interested on the additional land’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This letter was dated 5 August 1996 and Archispace replied on the same day to say that the defendants were still interested, and asked for the ‘procedures and conditions to secure the land so that the lease could be finalised’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Archispace’s letter also, inexplicably, stated that ‘our preliminary discussion with MINDEF reveals that the Old Yio Chu Kang Road is accessible to the public and can be used as an access to the site’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No evidence was led to justify this statement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In fact, to the contrary, the only letter from MINDEF was the one they received a year ago denying access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Archispace wrote a further letter to the plaintiffs dated 21 August 1996 in which, among other matters, it stated that the PWD ‘confirmed that the Old Yio Chu Kang Road was for the exclusive use of MINDEF’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They went on to say in their letter that ‘we subsequently wrote to MINDEF to allow emergency access only but was pleasantly surprised that MINDEF approved the access as it is “shared by other users”.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This last statement was untrue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> MINDEF did not approve access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their statement was clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had no authority to grant access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That lay with the PWD who had expressly refused to grant access.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 1 November 1996 the plaintiffs wrote directly to the defendants asking if they were still interested in the additional land (‘Plot 2’) with a lease of 21 plus 30 years with effect from 1 January 1997 at the rate of $74.95.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Archispace replied in the affirmative on behalf of the defendants. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence, the plaintiffs’ letter of offer dated 9 November 1996 was given to the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendants accepted the lease on 4 December 1996 without qualification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is significant because two days before that, their architects (Archispace) wrote to the Land Transport Authority asking if the LTA would confirm that access could be obtained through the Old Yio Chu Kang Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The LTA wrote on 12 December 1996 asking to meet Archispace to discuss the access question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Archispace only replied on 9 January 1997 asking to meet on 13 or 14 January 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Archispace alluded to their meeting with LTA in their letter about two months later (dated 14 March 1997) to the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">‘Although the issue of whether Old Yio Chu Kang Road next to the MINDEF camp is usable by public is “resolved”, we understand from informal discussions with LTA recently that this “Public Cat 3 Road”, may not be built in the near future.’</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Several months later, Archispace wrote a letter to the Urban Redevelopment Authority dated 23 May 1997 confirming that ‘the proposed future vehicular traffic entry and exit as shown on Drawing No. 00/A-RA is to be removed from the submission set as the Land Transport Authority has no future plans of upgrading the “Old Yio Chu Kang Road” in the near future.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 28 August 1997 Archispace wrote to the plaintiffs to say that the defendants were “concerned” that at the moment, they were liable to pay the rentals for the additional land and were also unable to proceed with their planned development.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On the facts above, Mr Rai made an impassioned submission on behalf of the defendants that the contract of lease for Plot 2 must be deemed to be frustrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But what really frustrated it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Rai says that because the authorities had refused them access through the Old Yio Chu Kang Road Plot 2 had become land-locked and totally inaccessible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That, he says, was the frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Counsel’s crutch was the Reid test in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council</i> [1956] AC 696, 721, cited with approval in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Singapore Woodcraft Manufacturing v Mok Ah Sai</i> [1978-79] SLR 516, 519 as follows:</span></p>

The High Court held that compulsory acquisition was a process and not an act and that the vendor is not divested of his title until after the State had taken possession of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court and held that the contract had been frustrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thean JA held that -</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It can be seen that the facts there are very different from the present one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The doctrine of frustration may be stated as a doctrine in contract law that where an unforeseen contingency occurs after a contract is made, and is due to neither party’s fault, and thereby rendering the contract incapable of performance (at least on the part of one of the parties), or performed in a way that was not envisaged by the parties, then the contract is said to be frustrated and the courts will, as far as possible, relieve the parties from further performance of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The doctrine of frustration as understood is naturally, limited by the facts of each case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the present case before me, the alleged contingency was the inability of the defendants to procure access to the contract site from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This cannot by any count be regarded as an unforeseen contingency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The converse is true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was not only foreseen before the contract, but it was made clear to the defendants, at least from an objective reading of all the correspondence disclosed and admitted into evidence, that consent from the relevant authority (in this case the Public Works Department) was required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was a known problem and one that was known for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But the defendants, through their architects, chose to interpret the correspondence as evidence of consent having been granted and represented as such to the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Even though they did not obtain approval, the defendants’ architects wrote to the plaintiffs and represented to them that ‘MINDEF approved the access as [the road] was shared by others’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is clear from the correspondence that this representation was untrue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I find, therefore, that at best, the defendants were happy to juggle two alternatives available to them at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first was to assume the known risk that approval for access from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road may not be granted, but they hoped that they could get the authorities eventually to relent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The danger contemplated was that the authorities might not relent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In such a case, there can be no frustration of the contract just because the risk delivers the harm that it had been carrying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The second option the defendants had at that time, was to rebuild his factory by amalgamating the old and new sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, as counsel submitted, the economic situation from 1997 onwards might have rendered this option unviable or impractical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The story of the landlocked tenant goes some distance in evoking sympathy, but it was nonetheless opportunistically conceived and thus, must be appraised reasonably and with detachment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Mr Rai also submitted that we ought to head the ‘reality of the situation’ and take into account that the lease agreement carry terms and conditions which stipulated that the defendants as lessees had to comply with the requirements from all the relevant authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence, if any of the relevant requirements could not be met owing to no fault of the defendants the contract of lease must be held to be frustrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The reality in such cases, which is similar to cases concerning the sale and purchase of real property, is that a lessee or, in the case of a sale and purchase, the purchaser, must protect himself if he enters into a contract before verifying whether all the relevant approvals that he requires will in fact be granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He does so simply with the standard ‘subject to approval’ clause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No such clause was inserted in the present contract nor was there any attempt to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Rai’s reliance on cl (C) in the Terms of Lease ‘to comply with the requirements from all the relevant authorities, e.g. URA, Land Office, LTA, CAAS etc’ as having the same effect is misplaced.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Clause (c) was admittedly part of a sparsely drawn set of conditions, but one must be reminded that these are conditions, not conditions precedent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus a breach would not render the contract void in itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the case of a condition, the remedies for breach may be determined in part by the nature and extent of the breach, the damage suffered, and any other relevant factor such as estoppel or waiver in the sense that the innocent party may choose to proceed notwithstanding that he had come to know, or ought reasonably have known about the breach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Reading that clause in context, the reader will naturally assume that if these conditions are breached the contract will be affected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The question is, in what way would a breach affect the contract?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unless expressly stated otherwise, these conditions must be complied with by the party on whom the burden to effect compliance falls, and that, conversely, gives the other party such remedies for breach as the law may allow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the context of the present terms and conditions, I am of the view that they were addressed to the lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff landlord had to satisfy any requirement of any of the suggested relevant authorities. The correspondence between the plaintiffs and defendants from 1994 to the end of 1997 is replete with indications that the defendants had to obtain a number of clearances from such named authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are standard terms in lease agreements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That being the case, the terms and conditions cannot reasonably be read to mean that if any of them had not been satisfied the defendants were entitled to treat the contract as at an end and walk away from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not that simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the duty or burden falls on the defendants then they cannot rely on their own failure to avoid the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Furthermore, if the defendants’ interpretation is right, then the established practice of inserting a ‘subject to approval’ clause by the purchaser or tenant will become virtually redundant because in most (if not all) such contracts, the vendor or landlord would have inserted conditions similar to the ones found in the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The purchaser or tenant would then be placed in a more favourable position at the expense of the vendor or landlord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In other words, if the defendants’ reliance on cl (c) is correct, then (without a ‘subject to approval’ clause) a failure to comply with any statutory requirement such as the failure to install a fire exit would entitle the defendants to avoid the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The same set of terms (cl (c)) cannot be interpreted one way for some requirements and another for others.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The argument for an implied warranty must be rejected because the correspondence shows that it was the defendants who were giving the plaintiffs the impression that there would be no difficulty getting access from the Old Yio Chu Kang Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But more fundamentally, if the warranty to be implied was that the defendant would be able to build a factory on Plot 2, then it cannot be said that there had been a breach because there was no evidence that a factory could not be built there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the contrary, from the evidence it appeared that it could have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The problem was really one of access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the evidence also does not justify an implied warranty that a factory could be built on Plot 2 ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">with access to the Old Yio Chu Kang Road</i>’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is so partly because there was a real possibility that access could be gained from Ang Mo Kio Street 63 either through the side of the defendants’ then existing building, or through a reconstruction of the existing building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Indeed, even up to 17 December 1997 it will be seen from the letters of Archispace, that the construction of a factory at Plot 2 was to be carried out simultaneously with the reconstruction of the existing building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their letter of 17 December 1997 to the URA has the heading:</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, any implied warranty would have to be in terms that a factory could be built on Plot 2 with access to the Old Yio Chu Kang Road or Ang Mo Kio Street 63.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But it would not be reasonable to imply a warranty in such wide and malleable terms when the party to whom that implied term would aid was at the material time, fully and totally aware of the nature and extent of the lack of access to Plot 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the facts, by reason of the concurrent leases held by the defendants, the defendants were in a position to rebuild their factory with access from Street 63.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> To say now that it would be too costly to do so does not detract from the evidence that it was a distinct prospect or reasonable possibility in 1996, when the defendants’ business was expanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I should emphasize that if the problem of access was not apparent to the defendants prior to the contract, they might have a reasonably strong case to avoid the contract on the ground that no reasonable tenant can be expected to rent property without at least an implied warranty from the landlord that there must be some means of access to the property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The case before me was, however, not pleaded or fought on that basis and the facts were very different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The defendants who raised the defence of frustration had not satisfied me that the lack of access – whether via the Old Yio Chu Kang Road or Ang Mo Kio Street 63 – was unforeseen at the time of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But, more importantly, the defendants were, on the other hand, aware of the risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By assuming that risk, they can neither now rely on frustration or an implied warranty of access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An implied warranty works only when something so obvious (to the ‘officious bystander’) was overlooked by the parties at the time of contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Given these circumstances, I am unable to find that there would be any implied warranty.</span></p>
