        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The dispute in the present case raises several
                    questions of law relating to the principles that govern the operation of
                    unincorporated associations and religious charitable trusts. In particular, it
                    raises the thorny question of what happens when a religious charity is alleged
                    to have deviated from the fundamental principles upon which it was
                    founded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellants are nine individuals who are the
                    members of the board of directors of the Far Eastern Bible College that was, on
                    26 January 2004, registered as a charity under the Charities Act (Cap. 37,
                    2007 Rev Ed) (“Charities Act”) (“the 2004
                    College”). The core of the present dispute relates to the question of
                    whether the 2004 College is the same entity as the bible college that was first
                    established in 1962 (“the College”). The Respondents are the Life
                    Bible-Presbyterian Church (“the Church”) and its trustees. Both
                    the Church and the College were until 2004 located at the same premises at 9,
                    9A, and 10 Gilstead Road (“the Premises”), on which the Church has
                    a lease (held through trustees). From 2007, the Church sought to exclude the
                    2004 College from functioning at the Premises.The Church is still operating at
                    the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Two suits were instituted following from this
                    purported exclusion. In Suit 648 of 2008 (“Suit 648”), one of the
                    Respondents, the Church, sought the following reliefs:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the 2004 College was a
                            different entity from the College;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an injunction to prevent the Appellants from using
                            the Premises, and to deliver vacant possession of the same to the Church
                            and its trustees; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an account of the moneys held by the College as at
                            the date of the registration of the 2004 College and to pay over the
                            said amount to the Church.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequently, the Appellants felt it necessary
                    to institute Suit 278 of 2009 (“Suit 278”) where they sought these
                    reliefs:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the funds donated for the
                            purchase and/or construction of the buildings located on the Premises
                            were impressed with a charitable purpose trust for the construction of
                            buildings for the use of the Church and the 2004 College (which they
                            aver is the same entity as the College), and that consequently, the
                            registered proprietors of the Premises hold them on a charitable purpose
                            trust for the joint benefit and use of the Church and the 2004
                            College;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an order for schemes be settled in respect of the
                            charitable purpose trusts over the moneys donated for the purchase

                            such schemes provide for trust deeds to be executed by the registered
                            proprietors of the said properties to set up the trust over the said
                            properties for the joint benefit and use of the Church and the 2004
                            College.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In essence, by Suit 648 the Church wants the
                    2004 College to vacate the Premises while by Suit 278 the 2004 College wants
                    recognition that the Premises are trust property and that the latter are held
                    for the joint benefit of the Church and the 2004 College. The trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) ruled in favour of the Church and its trustees in
                    both suits. The Judge held that the 2004 College was a different entity from the
                    College, and therefore not entitled to enjoy the property that was for the
                    benefit of the College.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Being dissatisfied with the rulings of the
                    Judge, the Appellants have appealed to this Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Formation of the Church and the College</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In 1955, the Church was formally constituted as
                    a member of the Bible-Presbyterian Church of Singapore. In 1986, it obtained
                    independent registration as a society under the Societies Act (Cap 311,
                    1985 Rev Ed), and was registered as a charity in 1987.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 19 September 1960, at a meeting of the
                    Presbytery of the Bible-Presbyterian Churches of Singapore, a formal decision
                    was taken to establish a college to train young Christians as evangelists,
                    pastors and teachers. A three-man committee consisting of Rev Timothy
                    Tow, Rev Quek Kiok Chiang and Dr Tow Siang Hwa was elected for the
                    purpose of drafting a constitution and prospectus for the college. In November
                    1961, a board of directors (“the Board”) for the College was
                    constituted, with Rev Timothy Tow at its helm. The Board unanimously adopted the
                    constitution (“the Constitution”) drafted by the three-man
                    committee. The College was duly established the following year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The close relationship between the Church and the College</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Right from its inception, the College shared a
                    special relationship with the Church. This was primarily due to two reasons.
                    First, the pastor of the Church, Rev Timothy Tow, was the person who had mooted
                    the idea of setting up the College. He was part of the 3 man committee who
                    drafted the Constitution and who later assumed the chairmanship of the Board
                    when the College was first constituted. He also served as the first principal of
                    the College.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Second, the College and the Church had always
                    shared the Premises, over which the Church has a lease held through
                    trustees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At this juncture, it would be necessary for us
                    to set out briefly how the Church came to be in possession of the Premises and
                    how the College came to operate from the same premises. :</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Soon after its formation, the Church started a
                            building fund in order to purchase its own premises. In August 1957, the
                            trustees of the Church purchased a 99 year lease over 9 and 9A Gilstead
                            Road.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Following the decision made by the
                            Bible-Presbyterian Churches of Singapore in 1960 to establish the
                            College, it was also decided that the College would be housed at 9 and
                            9A Gilstead Road. Thereafter, the building fund of the Church was
                            renamed the Life Church and Bible College Fund. Donations to the Church
                            and the College were placed into this common fund.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The College was the first to move into 9 and 9A
                            Gilstead Road, on 17 September 1962, occupying the annex to the
                            church building (“college annex”). The Church moved into
                            the church building the following year, after a dedication service on 16
                            February 1963.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Originally, it was agreed that in exchange for a
                            contribution of $75,000, the College would own half of the college
                            annex. The College had initially paid $20,000 towards this sum, using a
                            loan from two churches. However, when the two churches asked for the
                            return of the sum paid, a new agreement was reached under which the
                            Church would return the money on behalf of the College and the premises
                            at 9 and 9A Gilstead Road would be legally held by the Church which
                            would also pay for all physical expenses, while the College would be
                            responsible for the maintenance of the same.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In 1965, a second fund named the “Church
                            and College Extension Fund” was started for the purpose of
                            building an extension on 9 and 9A Gilstead Road, as the premises were
                            then inadequate for the needs of both the Church and the College. Like
                            the Life Church and Bible College Fund, the moneys collected came mostly
                            from tithes and offerings of the Church members, with a smaller amount
                            originating from other Christians who were mostly from the
                            Bible-Presbyterian community.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In 1970, a committee comprising of representatives
                            from the Church and the College was set up to draft an agreement
                            regarding the College’s occupation and use of 9 and 9A Gilstead
                            Road. Two representatives each from the Church and the College executed
                            an agreement entitled “Agreement between the [Church] and the
                            [College] on the sharing of the use of the Church and College Property
                            at 9 and 9A Gilstead Road”.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In 1989, a third fund – the Extension
                            Building Fund – was initiated for the purpose of acquiring 10
                            Gilstead Road. Moneys for this Fund were raised in much the same way as
                            they had been for the Church and College Fund ie, from the
                            Church’s own members, as well as members of other
                            Bible-Presbyterian churches. The acquisition of 10 Gilstead Road was
                            completed on 30 April 1990 and held, as in the case of 9 and 9A
                            Gilstead Road, by the trustees of the Church.</div>

                            set-up for the purpose of developing 10 Gilstead Road into a bible
                            college with hostel facilities (“the Beulah
                            Tower”).</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The dispute between the Church and the College</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In 2002, tensions developed between the
                    College and the Church when the College’s board endorsed a doctrine known
                    as “Verbal Plenary Preservation” (“VPP”) over the
                    “Verbal Plenary Inspiration” (“VPI”), a doctrine
                    accepted by the Church. Within the Church, there was mounting tension between
                    those who believed in VPP and those who believed in VPI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 20 August 2003, during a session meeting of
                    the Church, certain members of the Church expressed strong views against Rev
                    Timothy Tow’s endorsement of the VPP doctrine and he therefore resigned as
                    the pastor of the Church. He and a number of the other members of the Church
                    congregation split from it and founded the True Life Bible-Presbyterian Church
                    (“True Life Church”). On 19 November 2003, the Board of the
                    College informed the Church of its intention to register the College itself as a
                    charity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 26 January 2004, the members constituting
                    the board of the College obtained registration of a charity called “Far
                    Eastern Bible College” pursuant to the <em>Charities
                        Act</em> under a new constitution (“the 2004
                    Constitution”) as they could not then locate the Constitution. We should
                    at this juncture observe that subsequent to the registration of the Far Eastern
                    Bible College, the Constitution was found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Matters came to a head on 17 July 2004
                    when the Church wrote to the 2004 College stating that it would no longer allow
                    the 2004 College to use its properties as the 2004 College had been registered
                    as a separate and independent entity and, therefore, ceased to be a ministry of
                    the Church. Further letters were sent out by the Church on 28 January and
                    1 March 2008 stating that the 2004 College could only continue to occupy
                    the Premises if it gave an undertaking not to teach the VPP doctrine. When
                    efforts at reconciliation between the 2004 College and the Church failed, Suit
                    648 was instituted, followed shortly by Suit 278.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Contrary to the assertion of the Church, the
                    Judge held that the College was not a ministry of the Church and had never been
                    operated as such. In her opinion, the College was an unincorporated association
                    that was independent of the Church. Furthermore, the Premises had been acquired
                    and renovated with donations that were solicited in the names of and specified
                    to be for the joint benefit of both the College and the Church. Therefore, they
                    were impressed with a charitable purpose trust in favour of both the College and
                    the Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     However, the Judge held that the 2004 College
                    was a different entity from the College. She observed that the 2004 Constitution
                    was materially different from the Constitution, and that the effect of the
                    Appellants adopting the 2004 Constitution was to create a new unincorporated
                    association. In her opinion, the 2004 College was not a beneficiary of the
                    charitable purpose trust impressed on the Premises and had no right to occupy
                    the same. In any event, the Judge held that the Appellants had not proven that
                    they were the directors of the Board of the College and thus had no locus standi
                    to bring an application for a declaration of trust on behalf of the
                    College.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We will now turn to examine the issues on
                    which the Judge had made her rulings. To recap, they are the following:</p>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">What is the legal effect arising from the
                            Appellants’ act of registering a college in the College’s
                            name but with a different constitution?</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A.   Is the College a ministry of the Church?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is eminently clear that the Judge was
                    correct to have held that the College is not a ministry of the Church. We will
                    now examine the main reasons why she so held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     First, although the Church, through Rev
                    Timothy Tow, was the proponent of setting up the College, the final decision
                    rested with the Presbytery of the Bible-Presbyterian Churches of Singapore, of
                    which the Church was a member. This explains why the intended purpose of the
                    College, as stated in Art II of the Constitution, was a general one, namely, to
                    “train consecrated men and women and thoroughly furnish them to meet the
                    need of the Church of Jesus Christ, particularly in Singapore, Malaysia and
                    other Far Eastern countries, for church pastors, missionaries and other
                    Christian workers.” This undoubtedly suggests that the College was
                    intended to be a joint enterprise between the churches that belonged to the
                    Presbytery of the Bible-Presbyterian Churches of Singapore, rather than a
                    ministry of any particular church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, the founders of the College took
                    special care to ensure that the College was to be an independent association.
                    This is clearly reflected in Article V(1) of the Constitution which provided for
                    the College to be “an independent body not subject to ecclesiastical
                    control”, and which further specified that the relationship between the
                    College and the various bodies sponsoring it was only “one of
                    wholehearted co-operation and desire to see consecrated men and women well
                    trained”. While it is true that Article V(2) of the Constitution also
                    stated that the College is “closely connected” to the Church, this
                    is hardly sufficient to establish that the College was meant to be a ministry of
                    the Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Third, the Constitution contained specific
                    rules on how the members of the Board of the College was to be elected, and in
                    turn on how the executive committee that run the College was to be elected from
                    the Board. There is no provision that allows the Church to have any say at all
                    in the running of the College. Factually, the management of the College might
                    have been in the hands of Rev Timothy Tow, who was both the president of the
                    Board and principal of the College, as well as the founding and controlling
                    pastor of the Church. However, this does not mean that the College and the
                    Church were in law a single organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Fourth, the College was not funded exclusively
                    by the Church. Consistent with its character as a joint enterprise of the
                    churches belonging to the Presbytery of the Bible-Presbyterian Churches of
                    Singapore, it was also funded by donations from other churches and well wishers.
                    Furthermore, the financial accounts of the Church and the College were carefully
                    kept separate and distinct. All financial transactions which took place between
                    the Church and the College were described as “gifts” or
                    “loans” rather than internal transfers which would have been the
                    case if the Church and the College were part of the same entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Fifth, the sharing of the Premises by the
                    Church and the College was done in a formal manner by way of an agreement signed
                    by representatives of both parties (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                    above). This again unequivocably suggests that the representatives of both the
                    Church and the College regarded themselves as representing different
                    organisations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the light of the foregoing considerations,
                    we do not think that there is any basis to seriously argue that the College is a
                    ministry of the Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">B.   Is the College an unincorporated association or a charitable
                trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the Appellants, Mr Ang Cheng
                    Hock, argued that the Judge was wrong in finding that the College was an
                    unincorporated association. Instead, Mr Ang contended that the College was
                    a charitable trust with its board of directors acting as the charity trustees.
                    Mr Ang gave three reasons as to why the College could not be an
                    unincorporated association. First, he pointed out that all members of an
                    unincorporated association would have the right to attend its general meeting.
                    He then referred to the Judge’s conclusion that the College’s
                    members consisted of its directors, its executive committee and the faculty
                    members, and observed that the Constitution did not give the faculty members the
                    right to attend any general meetings or to elect members to the College’s
                    Board. Based on this, he argued that the College could not be an association
                    because the faculty members did not have the right that would ordinarily accrue
                    to members of an association. Second, Mr Ang pointed out that Article IV,
                    section 1(6) of the Constitution required one third of the College’s board
                    of directors to retire annually in rotation, and this was inconsistent with the
                    principle that an unincorporated association is an organisation where members
                    can join or leave at will. Finally, Mr Ang argued that none of the
                    College’s faculty members were ever asked to affirm their consent to the
                    Constitution, and this was inconsistent with the principle that an
                    unincorporated association is based on a contract with all its
                members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In our view, in the context of the critical
                    issues in this case, this is hardly a matter of any consequence. Let us explain.
                    A charity may exist in one of several legal structures, with the three most
                    basic forms being the trust, the unincorporated association and an incorporated
                    entity (see Peter Luxton, <em>The Law of Charities</em>
                    (Oxford University Press, 2001) at 255). A charitable trust, or for that matter
                    any trust, can only be validly constituted if the three certainties (certainty
                    of intention, object matter and subject matter) are fulfilled. Even if we assume
                    that the Constitution fulfils the requirements of certainty of intention and
                    object matter, there is nothing in it that states what property is meant to be
                    held by this purported trust. Indeed, at the point in time at which the College
                    was established pursuant to the written Constitution, there was no property that
                    was owned by the College (or its trustees) at all. Of all the criticisms raised
                    by Mr Ang against the Judge’s finding that the College is an
                    unincorporated association, he is correct in one respect, <em>i.e</em>., the Judge was wrong in regarding the faculty members as
                    members of the unincorporated association. The faculty members were simply staff
                    hired by the College to carry out its objects, just as any unincorporated
                    association can hire non-members, or even members, as its employees. This is
                    borne out by Article IV section 4(b) of the Constitution which provided that the
                    Board would have the power “to appoint the Principal and other members of
                    the teaching staff ... and to determine their terms of employment”. Being
                    employees, the faculty members would not, <em>per se</em>,
                    be entitled to attend general meetings, or elect the management of the College,
                    unless they should also happen to be a member of the Board. However, with regard
                    to Mr Ang’s contention that an unincorporated association must
                    necessarily be an organisation that a member could join or leave at will, while
                    that may ordinarily be the case it does not follow that an unincorporated
                    association ceases to be so when its rules provide otherwise. There is no
                    principle of law which preclude an association’s constitution from
                    stipulating that some of its current members should leave the association
                    annually for renewal purposes. Moreover, Mr Ang’s third argument
                    falls apart once we accept that the College’s members consisted of its
                    Board of directors, because the Board members were required to affirm their
                    consent to the Constitution under Article IV, section 1(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In our judgment, the College is really an
                    unincorporated association, the members of which are delegates from other
                    separate organisations (primarily the representatives of the Bible-Presyterian
                    Churches in Singapore), which have decided to cooperate to establish the College
                    in order to achieve a common purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, we wish to say that even if
                    Mr Ang is right that the College is a charitable trust with its board of
                    directors as the charity trustees, it will not make any real difference to the
                    outcome in relation to the other issues which will be decisive <em>vis-a-vis</em> the action. Whether a charitable trust has
                    arisen depends not on how it came into being but its objects. As mentioned in
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above, a charity can take the form
                    of an unincorporated association.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">C.   Are the Premises impressed with a charitable trust for the
                joint use of the Church and the College </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The facts outlined above clearly show that the
                    Premises were acquired/renovated through fund raising events which were
                    undertaken in the names of both the Church and the College (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). As the Judge correctly pointed
                    out, where the purpose of a fund raising effort is charitable, the funds raised
                    will be impressed with a charitable purpose trust for that purpose: see
                        <em>Attorney General of Queensland v Cathedral Church of
                        Brisbane</em> (1977) 136 CLR 353, <em>Neville Estates v
                        Madden and Ors</em> [1962] Ch 832.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">D.   Are the Appellants the current members of the Board </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Significance of the issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We turn now to the question as to whether the
                    Appellants are the current members of the Board, an issue which was only
                    cursorily raised and argued by the respective parties during the trial. The
                    Judge merely held at <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a> of the GD that
                    “[t]hey [the Appellants] have not shown that they are the directors of
                    the College.” Essentially, the Judge decided this issue by treating it as
                    a matter of burden of proof which the Appellants had failed to
                discharge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In this regard, we would point out that even
                    if the Judge was correct to have found that the Appellants were not the members
                    of the Board, and therefore not entitled to use the Premises in the name of the
                    College, she should not have granted the Respondents’ third prayer in
                    their Statement of Claim, which required the Appellants to give the Respondents
                    an account of the money held in the accounts of the College as at the date of
                    the registration of the 2004 College. The Respondents’ entire case was
                    premised on the basis that the College was a ministry of the Church and was thus
                    entitled to the accounts of the College. However, as shown above (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> to <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>),
                    this argument was soundly rejected by the Judge, who found that the Church and
                    the College were two different entities. Given that none of the Respondents had
                    claimed to be a member of the Board, there is no reason why they should be
                    entitled to an account of the property that is held on behalf of the
                    College.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A distinction must be drawn between a
                    charitable purpose and the institutional form (be it an unincorporated
                    association, individuals, or a company) through which the charitable purpose is
                    effected or administered. The dissolution of the institutional form does not
                    terminate the charitable purpose as long as that purpose is still capable of
                    being carried out: <em>Re Vernon’s Will Trusts</em>
                    [1972] 1 Ch 300. If the Judge was of the opinion that the members of the Board
                    (who are the members of the College as an unincorporated association) cannot be
                    ascertained, she should have ordered that the College be dissolved under the
                    equitable jurisdiction of the High Court: <em>Re Lead
                        Workmen’s Fund Society</em> [1904] 2 Ch 196. The property that
                    is held for the purpose of the College (ie, that part of the Premises that is
                    impressed with a charitable trust in favour of the College, and the money in the
                    College’s accounts) should then either be applied cy-pres, handed to the
                    Public Trustee, or turned over to the Commissioner of Charities (sections 21, 23
                    and 26B of the <em>Charities Act</em>
                respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the College’s board dissolved in 1989</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Counsel for the Respondents, Mr Quek Mong
                    Hua (“Mr Quek”), had argued during the trial that the
                    Appellants could not be the directors of the Board because it had been dissolved
                    in 1989, following the resignation of Mr Tow Siang Hwa as President.
                    Mr Quek based this argument on a statement contained in the minutes of the
                    Church’s Session meeting on 20 December 1989 stating that:</p>

                        dissolved after Dr Tow S.H. resigned as President. Rev Tow said that he had
                        been trying to revive the Board of Directors and in the future years he
                        envisaged that the dual role of the Pastor of our Church as principal of
                        FEBC would be maintained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There are two observations we would like to
                    make on these minutes. First, it is far from clear what this statement actually
                    meant. Second, these minutes should be viewed in the light of the testimonies of
                    the individuals who were the members of the College’s Board in 1989.
                    Mr Tow Siang Hwa, who was the President of the Board until his resignation
                    in 1989, testified on behalf of the Appellants that the Board was not dissolved
                    following his resignation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It seems to us that the apparent difference
                    over the question whether the Board was dissolved in 1989 stems from the
                    different senses in which Mr Quek and Mr Khoo Peng Kiat had used the
                    word “dissolve”. Mr Quek, perhaps because of his legal
                    training, used the word “dissolve” in a formal sense to mean that
                    the Board was legally dissolved in accordance with the College’s
                    Constitution such that thereafter the Board no longer existed. On the other
                    hand, Mr Khoo Peng Kiat seemed to have been using the word
                    “dissolve” in a loose manner to describe a situation where,
                    following the resignation of Mr Tow Siang Hwa, many of the board members
                    resigned and new members had to be appointed/elected to replace them. This
                    explains why Mr Khoo could confidently state that the Board continued after
                    the resignation of Mr Tow Siang Hwa. In all probability, this was also what
                    Rev Timothy Tow meant when he mentioned at the Respondent’s Session
                    meeting on 20 December 1989 that the College’s Board had been dissolved
                    after the resignation of Tow Siang Hwa and some other members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We are fortified in our perception of the
                    situation by the further fact that the Constitution does not have any provision
                    for the dissolution of the Board. Under the Constitution, the Board was intended
                    to be a self-perpetuating body whereby the current members would elect new
                    individuals to fill any vacancies on the Board. This is apparent from Article
                    IV, section 1(6) of the Constitution which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">About one-third of the members of the Board of Directors shall retire
                        annually in rotation. In the first instance, however, terms of office of
                        one, two and three years shall be allotted by the Board in its discretion.
                        Retiring members shall be eligible for re-election. Election by the Board of
                        new members shall take place at the Annual General Meeting, except for
                        vacancies occurring in the Board before the expiring of a term of office
                        when such vacancies may be filed as soon as possible by the Board until the
                        end of the term. Any member absent from three consecutive regular meetings
                        without the presentation of reasons acceptable to the Board shall be deemed
                        to have resigned</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Given that since 1989 new members have been
                    elected to replace retiring members or members who had resigned, and given
                    further that there is no provision in the Constitution which permit the
                    dissolution of the Board, one should be slow, barring an express resolution
                    adopted by the Board to bring its existence permanently to an end, to conclude
                    that the Board had been so dissolved. Indeed the incontrovertible fact is that
                    the Church had always regarded the Board as being in existence until 2002/2003
                    when the differences relating to doctrine surfaced. Accordingly, we find that
                    the Board was not dissolved, and continued to exist with the election of new
                    members, following the resignation of Mr Tow Siang Hwa as president in
                    1989.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The practice of the Board from its inception to date</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At the trial, Mr Quek pointed to the fact
                    that the Appellants were unable to produce any board minutes to show that the
                    Appellants had been validly appointed/elected as the current directors of the
                    Board. According to him, this would mean that the Appellants could not be the
                    current members of the Board. At best, they were only the directors of the 2004
                    College.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Admittedly, if there were minutes which
                    recorded the elections or appointments to the Board, those minutes would have
                    been the best evidence. However, many unincorporated associations, and the Board
                    would appear to be one such association, operate in an informal manner and do
                    not keep proper records of what actually transpire during their meetings. As
                    will be seen later, the Board has been operating in such an informal manner for
                    a long time and no one had taken issue with that until the emergence of the
                    current dispute due to doctrinal differences. In this regard, two further
                    circumstances must be borne in mind. First, as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>, the Board’s members are not chosen by
                    a fixed institution or from a pre-determined pool of people. Rather, it is a
                    self perpetuating body where the current members have the right to elect new
                    members, either to replace members who have retired/resigned or as additional
                    members. Hence, in order to determine whether the Appellants are the current
                    members of the Board, we have to trace the history of the Board’s
                    proceedings to see if they were properly elected by the Board’s members at
                    the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Second, based on the testimonies of the
                    witnesses at the trial, it is clear that the rotation policy mandated in Article
                    IV, section 1(6) of the Constitution was never scrupulously observed by the
                    Board. Even the Respondent’s own witness, Mr Khoo Peng Kiat,
                    testified that he had been a member of the Board for 24 years from 1979 to 2003
                    without having to go through the process of retirement and re-election.
                    Accordingly to him, Rev Timothy Tow would simply ask the members whose term had
                    expired if they would like to continue serving as a board member. If the answer
                    was yes, those members would automatically be “re-elected” (or
                    appointed). The same informal procedure was used when a vacancy on the Board had
                    to be filled. Rev Timothy Tow would simply find a replacement who would be
                    appointed as a board member as long as the other board members did not
                        object.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

                    from the 1960s till 1987. Mr Joshua Lim Heong Wee testified that he was
                    selected by Rev Timothy Tow to be a member of the Board.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Can you remember who appointed you as a
                            director?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Who appointed me? In the early days, the late Rev
                            Tow was the man who direct the College. He just pick whoever he thinks

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The minutes of the meetings of the Board from
                    1989 to 2001 indicate that no Board member was ever asked to retire from the
                    Board pursuant to Article IV, section 1(6) of the Constitution. Neither was
                    there any formal process of appointment when new members joined the Board. The
                    following was what happened:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Following the resignation of nine board members in
                            1989, seven new members (including the new President Tow Siang Yeow)
                            joined the Board in 1990. However, there is no evidence that any
                            official letter of appointment was given to the new members. Instead,
                            the minutes of the 1990 Board meeting merely indicated that the new
                            members were welcomed by the new president.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In 1993, four new members (Bob Phee, Sng Teck
                            Leong, Siow Chai Sheng and Han Soon Juan) were added to the Board. No
                            letters of appointment were given and the minutes of the 1993 Board
                            meeting merely state that “the following new members were
                            proposed and approved by the Board.”</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In 2001, Jeffrey Khoo was added to the Board. The
                            2000 minutes suggest that there was no election and what happened was
                            that “all present approved the addition of Jeffrey Khoo as a
                            member of the Board of Directors of FEBC”.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The evidence shows that the members of the
                    Board did not abide by Article IV, section 1(6) of the Constitution in relation
                    to either the election of new members or the mandatory retirement policy.
                    Practically, the members of the Board just carried on indefinitely, as long as
                    they wished to do so. New members were admitted to the Board not by formal
                    election, but by consensus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As a rule, acts taken by an entity’s
                    board of directors in breach of that entity’s constitution would, if
                    challenged, be null and void. However, the position here is that the members of
                    the College’s Board are the <b><u>only</u></b> members
                    of the College as an unincorporated association and they have collectively acted
                    in breach of the association’s constitutional rules in relation to the
                    election and retirement of members. Given that, in law, the Constitution is a
                    contract to which all the current members are parties, the failure of the
                    members, whose terms had expired, to retire constituted a breach of the
                    Constitution. The remaining members of the Board whose terms had not expired
                    should then have taken action to ensure the enforcement of the Constitution. In
                    our opinion, their failure to do so would amount to a waiver of the breach, as
                    well as acquiescence by them to the members whose terms had expired to remaining
                    on the Board: <b><em>Abbatt v Treasury Solicitor</em></b> [1969]
                    1 W.L.R. 1575. Alternatively, the current members could also be regarded as
                    having re-elected those members (whose terms had expired) to the
                Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there sufficient evidence to show that the Appellants are the
                current members of the Board</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It seems to us that in determining the
                    question of whether the Appellants have adduced sufficient evidence to show that
                    they are the current members of the Board, it is important to bear in mind the
                    circumstances alluded to above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>. In
                    addition, we would underscore the following points. First, none of the
                    Respondents’ witnesses who claimed to be past members of the Board
                    (Mr Khoo Peng Kiat, Mr Quek Kiok Chiang, Mr Joshua Lim, <em>etc</em>) have managed to produce any documentation as proof
                    of their membership. What is sauce for the goose must certainly be sauce for the
                    gander. It is hardly fair for Mr Quek to challenge the Appellants’
                    claim to membership of the Board merely because they could not produce any
                    letters of appointment, while conveniently ignoring the same problem that
                    affects his own witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Second, it appeared from Mr Quek’s
                    submissions made during the trial that he did not challenge the composition of
                    the Board as reflected by the minutes of the Board meetings before 1989. Taking
                    the position of the Board as in 1989, there were four members of the 1989 Board
                    who survived the leadership change in that year and continued to serve on the
                    Board in and after 1990. These four members were Rev Timothy Tan, Patrick Tan,
                    Cheng Wei Nien and Khoo Peng Kiat. In accordance with Article IV, section 1(6)
                    of the Constitution, these four members would have the right to elect new
                    members to the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Third, the 1990 minutes show that four out of
                    the nine Appellants (Tow Siang Yeow, Wee Hian Kok, Stephen Khoo and Koa Keng
                    Woo) were “welcomed’ to the Board in 1990. The addition of the four
                    Appellants to the Board met with no objection from the existing members, and it
                    would be reasonable to infer that they had agreed to it. We note that the
                    Respondent’s witness, Khoo Peng Kiat, who was a member of the Board in
                    1990 and also present at the 1990 meeting, did not voice any objection to the
                    addition of these four Appellants to the Board. Similarly, the 2001 minutes show
                    that Jeffrey Khoo joined the Board in 2001 without any objection from the then
                    Board members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Fourth, it is true that no minutes were
                    produced indicating that Quek Suan Yew, Prabhudas Koshy and Boaz Boon were
                    elected to the Board. Indeed, no minutes of meetings after 2000 were tendered to
                    court. While this is unfortunate, the critical fact remains that the six
                    existing Board members (Rev Timothy Tow, Tow Siang Yeow, Wee Hian Kok, Stephen
                    Khoo, Koa Keng Woo and Jeffrey Khoo) in the 2000 Board had recognized Quek Suan
                    Yew, Prabhudas Koshy and Boaz Boon as current members of the Board. In the
                    circumstances, the most likely and reasonable inference that should be drawn
                    from the circumstances is that they must have been elected onto the Board
                    sometime between 2001 and 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Fifth, despite the widespread publicity which
                    this case has engendered, no one has tried to intervene in this litigation on
                    the basis that they are the true current members of the Board of the College.
                    Neither have any of the Respondents claimed that they, instead of the
                    Appellants, are the true current members of the Board. On the other hand, it is
                    not disputed that the Appellants have been in control of the College and running
                    it since 1990. The correspondence between the Respondents and the Appellants
                    show that they dealt with the Appellants in their capacities as members of the
                    Board, and it was only until the commencement of the present litigation did they
                    start to deny the Appellants’ capacities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In light of these considerations, we are
                    unable, with respect, to agree with the Judge, that the Appellants have not
                    established, on a balance of probabilities, that they are the members of the
                    Board. On the contrary, we find that the Appellants have discharged that
                    burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">E.   The legal effect of the Appellants’ act of registering
                a college in the College’s name but under the 2004 Constitution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We now turn to the fifth issue (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above) where the Judge held that the
                    Appellants’ act of registering a charity with the 2004 Constitution and
                    under the name of “Far Eastern Bible College” pursuant to the
                        <em>Charities Act</em> on 26 January 2004 had the
                    effect of creating a new entity that was separate and distinct from the College.
                    Her decision was greatly influenced by the fact that Article VII of the
                    Constitution provided that any amendments to the Constitution could only be made
                    with the support of at least two-thirds of the Board at the annual general
                    meeting. As the Appellants could not show that the 2004 Constitution had been
                    adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article VII of the
                    Constitution, the Judge held that this could only mean that the Appellants had
                    failed to amend the Constitution, and had, instead, created a new entity
                    governed by the 2004 Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     When the members of an unincorporated
                    association seek to amend its constitution in a way that does not comply with
                    the prescribed procedure, the purported amendment would be invalid, and any acts
                    that are done pursuant to that invalid amendment are in consequence also void.
                    In <em>Re Tobacco Trade Benevolent Association Charitable
                        Trusts</em> [1958] 1 W.L.R. 1113, an unincorporated association tried
                    to change its constitution by a majority vote although there was no provision
                    for alteration of the constitution. The English Court held that in that
                    situation the members of the association could only have changed the
                    constitution with the concurrence of every member. Accordingly, the purported
                    amendment of the constitution was held to be a nullity. Similarly, in <em>Baldry v Feintuck and Others</em> [1972] 1 W.L.R. 552, the
                    members of an educational charitable association tried to adopt a new
                    constitution in order to apply the association’s funds for non charitable
                    purposes. The English court held that the members of a charitable association
                    did not have the power to change its constitution in a way that allowed its
                    funds to be used for non-charitable purposes. Therefore, the members’
                    purported adoption of the new constitution was a nullity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The principle that any purported amendment of
                    an association’s constitution by its members that does not follow the
                    prescribed procedure is void is well settled. As mentioned before, Article VII
                    provided that the Constitution could be amended by two-thirds majority of the
                    Board. The evidence before the court shows that the only reason why the Board
                    then decided to adopt a new constitution was because it wanted to register
                    itself as a charity under the Charities Act and could not find a copy of the
                    Constitution. Thus, they adopted a new constitution to effect the registration.
                    If the Board then had a copy of the Constitution, there would have been no
                    necessity to adopt a new constitution. They could have amended the Constitution
                    by two-third majority as the Board members are all now before the court as
                    Appellants, arguing that the 2004 College is the same as the College. It is
                    clear that the Board in adopting the 2004 Constitution for the purpose of
                    effecting registration had no intention to create a new college, distinct from
                    the College.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     We are fortified in that view by the fact that
                    in seeking registration of the College with the Commissioner of Charities
                    (“the Commissioner”), the Appellants had informed the Commissioner
                    that the college they were registering was formed in 1962. Neither is there any
                    doubt that the Appellants had submitted copies of the College’s audited
                    accounts for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 to the Commissioner as part of the
                    application form to register the College. Clearly, both the subjective and
                    objective intentions of the Appellants were to register the College as a
                    charity, and not to create a new entity. Granted that the Appellants did not
                    adopt the new 2004 Constitution in compliance with the rules in the
                    Constitution, this should only mean that their act of registering the College
                    with the 2004 Constitution was wrongful, and perhaps the registration is a
                    nullity, but we cannot see how the Appellants could be considered to have
                    created a new entity, which was the last thing in their mind. For these reasons,
                    we are unable to agree with the Judge’s conclusion that the
                    Appellants’ act of registering a college in the same name as the College,
                    but with the 2004 Constitution, had the effect of creating a new
                entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">F.   The doctrinal matter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Judge’s decision in favour of the
                    Respondents was based entirely on her finding that the 2004 College was a
                    different entity from the College. Given that we do not share her views on that
                    issue, her judgment in favour of the Respondents therefore cannot stand.
                    However, there is a need for us to consider the very issue which caused the
                    Church and the College to be estranged. As stated in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above, the College has now adopted the VPP doctrine whereas
                    the Church maintained its stand of adhering to the VPI doctrine. It is not in
                    dispute that prior to the College adopting the VPP doctrine, it was a religious
                    charitable entity with the object of training people to be “church
                    pastors, missionaries and other Christian workers”. We do not see how the
                    fact that the College has now embraced the VPP doctrine makes it any less of a
                    religious charitable entity. The College continues to pursue its object of
                    training “consecrated men and women” for the aforesaid purposes.
                    What the Respondents seem to be arguing is that as the donations were received
                    for the purpose of acquiring the Premises for the use of the College which then
                    subscribed to the VPI, this change by the College to adopting the VPP doctrine
                    is so fundamental that the College ceases to be entitled to use the Premises. In
                    short, the Respondents’ contention is that the Premises are impressed with
                    such a purpose trust and the trustee holding the Premises must ensure that only
                    persons/entities pursuing objects of the trust will be allowed to enjoy the
                    benefits under it, and what the College is now pursuing falls outside the
                    objects of the trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     At the hearing before us, both counsel focused
                    very much on the contrast between the VPI doctrine (that was accepted by both
                    the Church and the College) and the VPP doctrine (that is now accepted only by
                    the College). Mr Quek argued that the VPP doctrine was a deviation from the
                    fundamental doctrine of the College because it was an entirely different
                    creature from the VPI doctrine. On the other hand, Mr Ang stressed that the
                    VPP doctrine was really an extension of the VPI doctrine, and that the College
                    continued to fulfill its object of training Christians for Christian work
                    notwithstanding its adoption of the VPP doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Thus the question here is whether the
                    College’s adoption of the VPP doctrine constitute such a fundamental shift
                    that it should be regarded as pursuing something so different from the original
                    objects of the College. Article III of the Constitution, which sets out the
                    basic doctrines that would inform and guide the work of the College,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The system of doctrine contained in the Scriptures and expounded in the
                        historic Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms shall form the basis
                        of instruction in the College. The great fundamentals, including the
                        pre-millenial return of Christ, shall be faithfully taught. True piety is to
                        be nurtured, and an attitude of devotion and constant prayerfulness
                        inculcated. Christian doctrine is never to be divorced from Christian life,
                        and Biblical separation from all that is unclean is both to be taught and
                        exemplified. The College is to test all things by the Word of God, as
                        carefully and prayerfully studied. It is to stress those matters that the
                        Bible clearly and repeatedly presents, and to avoid giving undue importance
                        to matters of doubtful interpretations. Fellowship with all who are loyal to
                        the Scripture is to be maintained, but compromise with any who reject its
                        clear teachings is to be avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     There is nothing in this Article which could
                    even remotely be of assistance to resolving the very problem now before us.
                    However, there are precedents from other jurisdictions which provide some
                    guidance on the approach which this court should adopt in such
                cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Survey of cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We now turn to consider some of these cases.
                    In <em>Craigdallie v. Aikman</em> (1813) 1 Dow 1, H.L.
                    (Sc.) and <em>Craigdallie v. Aikman (No. 2)</em> (1820) 2
                    Bli. 529, H.L. (Sc.) (“<em>Craigdallie”</em>)
                    a group of seceders from the church of Scotland had contributed money and
                    resources towards the acquisition of a meeting house for worship for their
                    congregation. The members of this congregation established a synod as the
                    constituted authority. The congregation also established a confession of faith
                    for its members, as well as a formula by which candidates for admission into the
                    congregation were interrogated. In 1797, a committee of the congregation adopted
                    a preamble as an explanation to the formula, and this was approved by the synod
                    in 1799. A minister in the congregation protested against the adoption of the
                    preamble and expressed his unwillingness to accept the authority of the synod
                    until the preamble was removed. In response, the synod expelled the minister
                    from the congregation and excluded him from the pulpit of the meeting house.
                    Thereafter, the expelled minister and his supporters (“the
                    petitioners”) brought an action seeking a declaration that the meeting
                    house belonged to them, as they were the members of the congregation who had
                    adhered to its original principles. The synod brought a counter action seeking a
                    declaration that the petitioners, by declining the jurisdiction of the synod,
                    had lost any interest in the property of the congregation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     After almost 10 years of hearings, the suit
                    finally came before the House of Lords in 1813. The court remitted the case back
                    to the Scottish Court of Session with the finding that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the meeting house had been acquired by the members
                            of the congregation with the intent that it should be used for the
                            purpose of religious worship by members who agreed in their religious
                            opinion, and intended to continue in communion with each other;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the meeting house belonged to the members of the
                            congregation who adhered to the religious principles of those who were
                            the original members of the congregation</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Upon remission, the Court of Session found
                    that the alleged differences between the preamble and the religious principles
                    of those who were the original members of the congregation were
                    non-intelligible, and that the petitioners had failed to prove that the current
                    members of the congregation had departed from the religious principles of the
                    original members. Based on this finding, the House of Lords held in 1820 that
                    the petitioners had voluntarily disassociated themselves from the congregation,
                    and that their claim that the meeting house belonged to them solely was not
                    founded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     
          <em>Craigdallie</em> has
                    been interpreted as standing for the proposition that in the event of a dispute
                    between opposing factions of a religious institution, the court would favour the
                    faction that adhered to the practices of the original members, over the faction
                    that had altered the institution’s doctrines/practices. However, the House
                    of Lords seemed to have qualified this broad principle somewhat with the caveat
                    that the alteration should, objectively, be of material importance to that
                    religious institution. Therefore, even though the petitioners were undoubtedly
                    the faction that had adhered most faithfully to the original practices of the
                    congregation (in contrast to the synod which added the preamble), the court
                    found for the synod because the addition of the preamble did not create any
                    “intelligible” difference with the original doctrines/practices of
                    the congregation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Next is the case of <em>Attorney-General v Pearson</em> (1817) 36 E.R. 135 (“<em>Pearson</em>”) which raised the question of whether a
                    trust deed that was set up to provide a meeting house for “the worship
                    and service of God” had been breached when the trustees started to engage
                    in unitarian worship. The trustees claimed that the purpose of the trust, as
                    expressed in the trust deed, was to provide a meeting place for the worship and
                    service of God, without any mention of the doctrine to be preached. Accordingly,
                    they were entitled to engage in unitarian worship, as well as to eject the
                    plaintiffs for their continued insistence on trinitarian worship. On the other
                    hand, the plaintiffs claimed that the teaching of unitarianism was against the
                    original intentions of the founders who had believed in trinitarianism.
                    Accordingly, they argued that the meeting house should continue to be used only
                    for trinitarian worship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Eldon LC, who had written the judgment in
                        <em>Craigdallie</em>, held that the key issue in the
                    case was whether the original intentions of the founders were for the meeting
                    house to be a place for exclusively trinitarian purposes, or whether the meeting
                    house was merely to be a place for general Christian worship. Accordingly, it
                    directed an inquiry for the original intentions of the founders to be
                    ascertained. At the same time, having regard to the fact that the plaintiffs had
                    clearly not breached the purposes of the trust, the court also ordered that the
                    trustees undertake not to eject the plaintiffs from the meeting house until the
                    inquiry was over.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     
          <b><em>Pearson</em></b>
                    reiterated the proposition in <em>Craigdallie</em> that the
                    court would not allow the members of a religious institution from promulgating a
                    different doctrine if doing so would deviate from the purpose of the trust. It
                    is significant to note that the court did not restrict its inquiry regarding the
                    purpose of the trust to the terms of the trust deed itself. Indeed, the
                    Solicitor General in that case had argued that the general words in the trust
                    deed (“for the worship and service of Almighty God”) did not
                    prescribe the form of worship or the doctrines to be inculcated, and that it
                    would be wrong for the court to impose a certain doctrine on the trust. The
                    Court rejected this argument and held that the absence of any restriction on
                    doctrine did not necessarily mean that there were no limits on doctrine at all.
                    Having regard to factors such as unitarianism being illegal at the time the
                    trust was established, and clauses in the trust deed suggesting that the
                    founders did not intend to allow an illegal form of worship, the court concluded
                    that the founders did intend that the meeting house be used for a certain type
                    of worship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The third case we will consider is <em>Attorney General v Aust</em> (1865) 13 LT 235
                        (“<em>Aust</em>”) where the issue was
                    whether any persons, other than the denomination of Nonconformists termed
                    “Independents”, were eligible to occupy a chapel endowed under a
                    trust. The trust deed provided that the chapel was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">to be used and enjoyed as a place of public religious worship for the
                        service of God by the society of Protestant Dissenters of the denomination
                        of Independents, and professing the doctrines contained in the Catechism of
                        the Assembly of Divines held at Westminster, and commonly called the
                        Assembly’s Catechism,’ and also by such other persons as shall
                        hereafter be united to the said society, and attend the worship of God in
                        the said meeting house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The result in <em>Aust</em> is not important for our purposes. What is significant
                    about <em>Aust</em> is that it qualifies the principle laid
                    down in <em>Pearson</em> as to the propriety of using
                    extrinsic evidence to determine the fundamental tenets of a religious
                    institution when there is a trust deed (or its equivalent) in existence.
                    Kindersley VC held that resort to extrinsic evidence was appropriate if the
                    trust deed did not reveal what were the fundamental tenets. However, if the
                    trust deed had already laid down the original doctrines and form of worship, the
                    use of extrinsic evidence should not be resorted to. This can be seen from the
                    following extract of the judgment (at 236):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is the duty of the court to ascertain in the first instance the
                        nature of the religious worship intended at the time of the origin of the
                        chapel, and as it is very often impossible to ascertain this with certainty
                        from the absence of any instrument of endowment, or from the words of such
                        instrument being ambiguous, that the court must then resort to the usage of
                        the congregation in order to discover what those doctrines were. But if, on
                        the other hand, from there being an actual deed of endowment, or from the
                        fact that such a deed had existed being proved, the court has discovered the
                        nature of the original doctrines and worship, it will maintain the worship
                        prescribed by the endowment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     We now move to consider perhaps the most
                    famous case in the 20th century which raised the question of schism in a
                    religious institution. In <em>General Assembly of Free Church of
                        Scotland v Lord Overtoun</em> [1904] A.C. 515 (“<em>Overtoun</em>”) (also known as <em>Bannatyne v Overtoun</em> [1904] AC 515) a majority of a denomination
                    of Christians which called itself the Free Church of Scotland (“Free
                    Church”) decided to merge with the United Presbyterian Church under the
                    name of the United Free Church. The Free Church property was conveyed to new
                    trustees to hold on behalf of the new Church. A minority of the members of the
                    Free Church opposed the merger on the grounds that the merged institution had
                    departed from two fundamental doctrines of the Free Church, which were the
                    Establishment principle, and the unqualified acceptance of the Westminster
                    Confession of Faith. According to the minority members, these two doctrines were
                    part of the constitution of the Free Church and could not be altered. The
                    minority claimed that the United Presbyterian Church was opposed to the
                    Establishment principle, and did not maintain the Westminster Confession of
                    Faith in its entirety. The merger left ministers and laymen free to hold
                    opinions as regards the Establishment principle and the predestination doctrine
                    (in the Westminster Confession) as they pleased, and this constituted a breach
                    of trust inasmuch as the property of the Free Church was no longer being used
                    for the benefit of the original purposes of the Free Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The House of Lords identified the issue in
                    question as being whether the merger had indeed breached the fundamental
                    doctrines of the Free Church such that the minority was the true representative
                    of the Free Church. It was common ground between the parties that the Free
                    Church had no formal written constitution, trust deed or other such document
                    setting out those principles. The five members of the House of Lords who ruled
                    in favour of the minority members (Earl of Halsbury LC, Lord Davey, Lord James,
                    Lord Robertson and Lord Alverstone) found as a fact that the Establishment
                    principle and unqualified acceptance of the Westminster Confession of Faith were
                    fundamental doctrines of the Free Church, and that these doctrines had been
                    altered by the merger. Furthermore, the constitution of the Free Church did not
                    contain any provision for the alteration of its fundamental doctrines.
                    Accordingly, the majority members were not entitled to transfer the property of
                    the Free Church to the newly merged church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The two dissenting members of the House of
                    Lords who found for the majority gave different reasons for doing so. Lord
                    Macnaghten held that the Establishment principle and Westminster confession of
                    faith were not the fundamental principles on which the Free Church was founded,
                    and therefore the merger did not amount to a breach of trust. Furthermore, the
                    Free Church had the power to change her doctrines through the general assembly.
                    Accordingly, it was well within the majority’s right to change these
                    doctrines pursuant to the merger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In contrast to Lord Macnaghten’s liberal
                    interpretation of the powers of the Free Church, Lord Lindley adopted a more
                    circumspect approach towards the interpretation of the Free Church’s
                    competence to alter its doctrines. In his Lordship’s opinion, the
                    constitution of the Free Church conferred on its general assembly the freedom to
                    alter its religious doctrines. However, this power had to be used bona fide for
                    the purposes for which they were conferred, and could not be used to destroy the
                    Free Church itself. Although the limits of this power could not be defined
                    precisely, the court could, in the majority of cases, determine whether a
                    particular change was within this power. The Free Church’s competence to
                    alter its religious doctrine was limited by its identity as a Christian Church
                    and a Reformed Protestant Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     
          <em>Overtoun</em> is an
                    important case for two reasons. First, the House of Lords established that a
                    mere divergence from the original practice of a religious institution’s
                    founders was insufficient to show a breach of trust. The divergence had to be
                    related to a “fundamental and essential” doctrine of the
                    institution before it could amount to a breach of trust. This was so held by all
                    seven members of the House. As Lord James stated (at 656):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is necessary first to determine to what extent the Free Church was
                        based upon the principles of Establishment. But before entering upon such
                        inquiry it is, I think, worthy of remark that the Church is not a positive,
                        defined entity, as would be the case if it were a corporation created by
                        law. It is a body of men united only by the possession of common opinions,
                        and if this community of opinion ceases to exist, the foundations of the
                        Church give way. <em>But difference of opinion to produce
                            this result must be in respect of fundamental principles, and not of
                            minor matters of administration or of faith</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Second, the majority of the House also
                    confirmed that it was possible for a religious institution to confer upon its
                    trustees the power to alter the religious doctrines on which it was based,
                    including its fundamental doctrines. However, such a power had to be expressly
                    conferred. In the absence of any words to that effect, the courts would construe
                    any power of plenary legislation as relating only to administrative issues, and
                    not to matters of doctrine. As Lord Davey stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The bond of union, however, may contain within itself a power in some
                        recognised body to control, alter, or modify the tenets and principles at
                        one time professed by the association. But the existence of such a power
                        would have to be proved like any other tenet or principle of the
                        association. [at 646]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[L]et it be assumed that the language of the Act does imply the existence
                        of some power. Certainly it is not necessarily an unlimited or general
                        power, and the question then is, what is the extent or what are the limits
                        of the power? It has been said that it is a power to legislate in any manner
                        not inconsistent with the continued existence of the Church. But applying
                        that to the case now before us, what, it may be asked, is the Church but an
                        organized association of Christians holding certain doctrines and principles
                        in common? [651]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think the Dean of Faculty was logically right in contending for an
                        unrestricted power of legislation. But if the property was intended to be
                        held in trust for a body of Christians holding such doctrines as the
                        majority acting through the General Assembly might from time to time
                        approve, such an intention should be made clear beyond the possibility of
                        question. [651]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     A more recent case is <em>MacKay v MacLeod</em> (10 January 1952, unreported)
                        (“<em>MacKay</em>”) where the subjects of
                    a trust were expressed to be “for the sole use and behoof of the
                    Congregation of the Body of Christians called ‘The Free Presbyterian
                    Church of Scotland’ presently worshipping in the Free Presbyterian Church,
                    North Church Place, Inverness, and adhering to the Constitution and to the whole
                    standards of the Free Church of Scotland as set forth and enumerated in the
                    hereinafter mentioned Deed of Separation”. The Deed of Separation
                    contained an enumeration of a number of well known doctrinal and ecclesiastical
                    formularies, beginning with the Westminster Confession of Faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In 1938, the congregation split into two
                    sections over a religious dispute, and the court was called upon to determine
                    which section was entitled to the property of the trust. In order to answer this
                    question, the court held that it first had to decide whether either section had
                    departed from the fundamental doctrines of the church. In relation to this
                    inquiry, the Lord President laid down a principle of construction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the difference leading to a secession relates to a matter not covered
                        by the constitution and standards, and if therefore the continuing section
                        cannot be shown to have violated or departed from the constitution and
                        standards, the seceders secede at their peril and cannot by professions of
                        conscientious conviction elevate minor or extraneous points of controversy
                        into principles embodied in the Church's constitution and standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     This approach advocated in <b><em>MacKay</em></b> is important, especially in relation to a case where the
                    change in doctrine concerns matters that are not covered by the trust deed or
                    constitution of the religious institution. In our view, there is much to be said
                    in favour of adopting this approach, as it is both practical and
                    sensible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     A century after the House of Lords had
                    resolved the dispute between the contending parties in <em>Overtoun</em>, a second dispute arose between the General Assembly of
                    the Free Church and a minority of dissentient members. <em>In
                        Free Church of Scotland v General Assembly of the Free Church of
                        Scotland</em> [2005] 1 S.C. 396 (“<em>Free
                        Church</em>”), a minority of members in the Free Church of
                    Scotland brought an action against the General Assembly of the Free Church,
                    claiming that the General Assembly had ceased to adhere to the fundamental
                    principles of the Free Church, and was therefore no longer entitled to the
                    beneficial interest in the Free Church’s property. The minority members
                    claimed that the constitution of the Free Church contained a fundamental
                    principle of the right of continued protest, and that the General Assembly had
                    breached this fundamental right by preventing the minority members from airing
                    their grievances concerning the alleged misconduct of a particular professor
                    teaching in the Free Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Court of Session identified the main issue
                    in the case to be whether the right of continued protest was so fundamental to
                    the Free Church that the General Assembly had abrogated its right to use the
                    assets of the Free Church by departing from it. Ultimately, the court held that
                    it was unable to identify a right of continued protest as a fundamental
                    constitutional principle of the Free Church. Although some members of the Free
                    Church had acted in a way that could be regarded as supporting a right of
                    protest, it was more appropriate to interpret such acts as a means to achieve
                    the objective of preserving the substantive fundamental principles of the Free
                    Church, rather than as a principle by itself. Accordingly, the court held that
                    the General Assembly had not deviated from the fundamental principles of the
                    Free Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The significance of this case is that it
                    illustrates the fine balance which the court has to maintain when it tries to
                    determine whether a particular tenet is a fundamental principle of a religious
                    institution. As in <em>Overtoun</em>, the court considered
                    that it was entitled to take into account all relevant evidence when determining
                    if the Free Church was founded on the fundamental principle of the right of
                    protest. However, the approach of the court also suggests that the mere fact
                    that the founders of a religious institution had acted in a particular way, does
                    not ipso facto mean that the particular way of acting was so fundamental that
                    any departure from it would amount to a breach. There must be some evidence that
                    the founders themselves considered it to be fundamental.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     We will finally refer to the rather
                    interesting case of <b><em>Varsani v Jesani (Cy Pres)</em></b>
                    [1999] Ch. 219 (“<em>Varsani</em>”) which
                    would seem to suggest that there is an alternative to the
                    “zero-sum” method which the courts had traditionally employed to
                    resolve disputes of this nature. The plaintiffs and the defendants in this case
                    were both followers of a Hindu sect, Shree Swaminarayan Gadi, based in
                    Maninagar, Gujarat, India. An essential tenet of the faith was that the founder
                    was believed to have been the incarnation or manifestation of the Supreme Being.
                    The followers believed that there was a direct line of succession from the
                    founder through three other successors to Shree Muktajivandasji Swaminarayan
                    (“Muktajivandasji”). Muktajivandasji remained the Acharya or
                    leader of the sect until he died in 1979. About ten years before he died,
                    Muktajivandasji established a constitution to govern the affairs of the sect,
                    including his succession (”the 1969 constitution”). The 1969
                    constitution did not stipulate whether the successor had any divine attributes,
                    and further provided that the successor could be removed if he misconducted
                    himself in certain ways. Before he died, Muktajivandasji appointed one Shree
                    Purushottam Priyadasji (“Priyadasji”) to be his successor as the
                    leader of the sect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In or about 1985, allegations of misconduct
                    surfaced against Priyadasji in relation to a trip he made to England. A majority
                    of members in India and England did not accept the allegations against the
                    successor. They continue to recognise his authority, and his divine status. The
                    minority believed that the allegations were true and that he had lost the right
                    to lead the sect. This dispute finally culminated in cross suits between the
                    majority and minority groups. The majority started a suit in 1988 seeking the
                    removal of the trustees who were members of the minority group and a scheme for
                    the administration of the charity. In 1990, the minority commenced their own
                    suit seeking declarations that the successor had ceased to be the spiritual
                    leader of the sect and that those who continued to accept him as their spiritual
                    leader were not entitled to worship in the London temple or otherwise to have
                    the use and benefit of the assets of the charity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    original purpose of the charity was to promote the faith of Swaminarayan
                    according to the teachings and tenets of Muktajivandasji. However, the teachings
                    of Muktajivandasji did not deal with whether a belief in the divine attributes
                    of his successor were essential tenets of the faith, and it was therefore not
                    possible to determine whether either group had departed from the fundamental
                    tenets of the faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In any event, the court considered that it had
                    the power under section 13(1)(e)(iii) of the Charities Act 1993 (UK) to settle a
                    cy-pres scheme for the division of the charity’s assets. That section
                    stated that cy-pres was available</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the original purposes of the gift had “ceased in any other
                        way to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property
                        available by virtue of the gift, regard being had to the appropriate
                        considerations.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The court held that under this section, when
                    considering the appropriateness of settling a cy-pres scheme, the court had to
                    look beyond the original objects of the trust and to seek to identify the spirit
                    in which the donors gave property upon trust for those purposes. Having regard
                    to this, it then concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he spirit in which property was given in 1967 was a desire to provide
                        facilities for a small but united community of the followers of
                        Muktajivandasji in and around Hendon to worship together in the faith of
                        Swaminarayan. The original purposes specified in the declaration of trust -
                        that is to say the promotion of the faith of Swaminarayan as practised in
                        accordance with the teachings and tenets of Muktajivandasji - are no longer
                        a suitable and effective method of using the property given in 1967, or
                        added property held upon the same trusts, because the community is now
                        divided and cannot worship together. Nothing that the court may decide will
                        alter that. To hold that one group has adhered to the true faith and that
                        the other group has not will not alter the beliefs of that other group. The
                        position will remain that the community cannot worship together. <em>To appropriate the use of the property to the one group to the
                            exclusion of the other would be contrary to the spirit in which the gift
                            was made</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Section 13(1)(e)(iii) of the Charities Act
                    1993 (UK) is in pari materia with s 21(1)(e)(iii) of our own Charities Act.
                    Hence, it is within the power of the court to adopt the approach advanced in
                        <em>Varsani</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of principles </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The principles that can be drawn from the
                    above stated cases are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    Where a trust/gift is established for the benefit
                            of a religious institution, it is a breach of trust/gift for the members
                            of that religious institution to deviate from the purpose of that
                            trust/gift. To the extent that the purpose of the trust/gift involves
                            issues regarding adherence to certain religious beliefs or doctrine, it
                            is the duty of the court to take cognisance of these matters to
                            determine whether the purpose of the trust/gift has been breached: see
                                <em>Craigdallie</em> and <em>MacKay</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ii)  The mere fact that the members of that religious
                            institution has deviated from the original doctrines and practices of
                            that institution does not ipso facto amount to a breach of the purpose
                            of the trust/gift. <em>Craigdallie</em>. The
                            deviation must be material and relate to a “fundamental and
                            essential” doctrine/practice of the institution: see <em>Craigdallie</em> and <em>Overtoun</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  The party who alleges that there has been a
                            deviation from a fundamental and essential doctrine/practice of a
                            religious institution bears the burden of proving it: see<em>Craigdallie</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv)  Whether a particular doctrine or belief is
                            “fundamental or essential” to a religious institution is a
                            question of fact. In this respect, particular regard should be given to
                            the terms of the trust/gift if there is one, since it is presumed to
                            manifest the intentions of its founders: see <em>Aust</em> and <em>Free
                            Church</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(v)    The mere fact that the trust deed does not
                            prescribe any particular form of doctrine/worship does not necessarily
                            mean that the founders did not intend that there should be no
                            limitations on doctrine/worship at all. The court is entitled to refer
                            to extrinsic evidence to determine whether the founders intended to
                            impose certain restrictions on doctrine/worship, notwithstanding the
                            absence of express words to that effect: see <em>Pearson</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(vi)  Where the trust deed prescribes the doctrines and
                            forms of worship that are to be promulgated by the religious
                            institution, there is an inference that these are the essential and
                            fundamental principles of that religious institution. <em>Aust</em>. The more detailed the trust deed is in relation to
                            these matters, the stronger the inference that it is meant to be an
                            exhaustive list. In such cases, any matters not covered by the trust
                            deed are presumed to be non fundamental<em>: see
                                MacKay</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(vii) A trust deed may confer upon a religious
                            institution the power to alter its fundamental doctrines/practices.
                            However, such a power must be expressly provided for. In the absence of
                            clear words to that effect, powers of plenary legislation will be
                            construed as relating only to administrative issues, and not to matters
                            of fundamental doctrine/practices: see <em>Overtoun</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(viii)    In the absence of a trust deed, the court is
                            entitled to look at extrinsic evidence to determine the essential
                            fundamental doctrines/practices of a religious institution. <em>Overtoun</em>. Neither is the court restricted to
                            extrinsic evidence existing at the time of the creation of the
                            trust/gift. The subsequent conduct of the members of the religious
                            institution may also be used to infer the original intentions of the
                            founders: see <em>Free Church</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ix)  Caution must be exercised when using extrinsic
                            evidence to determine the fundamental doctrines/practices of a religious
                            institution. The mere fact that the founders of a religious institution
                            adhered to certain doctrines and practices does not ipso facto mean that
                            these doctrines and practices are fundamental to that religious
                            institution. There must be some evidence to show that the founders
                            themselves considered those doctrines/practices to be fundamental: see
                                <em>Free Church</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(x)    In the event of a dispute between members of a
                            religious institution over questions of whether there has been a
                            deviation from the essential and fundamental principles of that
                            institution, the court retains an overarching discretion to settle a
                            cy-pres scheme under section 21(1)(e)(iii) of the Charities Act without
                            inquiring into whether there has been such a departure: see <em>Varsani</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The College’s essential and fundamental religious
                doctrines</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In this case, the essential and fundamental
                    doctrines that inform and guide the work of the College are set out in Article
                    III of its constitution. We have in <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>
                    above quoted the said Article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It is clear from this Article that the
                    fundamental doctrine of the College is to be the Westminster Confession of faith
                    (“the Westminster Confession”). The Westminster Confession is a
                    document drawn up by the Westminster Assembly in 1646. This assembly consisted
                    of 121 Puritan clergymen who were called upon by the English parliament to
                    provide advice on issues of church doctrine, worship and government. The
                    Westminster Confession has been highly influential within Presbyterian churches
                    worldwide, many of which use it as a standard of doctrine that is second only to
                    the teaching contained in the Bible itself. The part of the Westminster
                    Confession that is relevant for our purposes is Article VIII, Chapter 1
                    (“Article VIII”). Article VIII has been interpreted by many
                    Protestants who adhere to the Westminster Confession as standing for the
                    principal belief that the Bible is divinely inspired. Article VIII reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
                        of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which, at the time of the
                        writing of it, was most generally known to the nations), being immediately
                        inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all
                        ages, are therefore authentical; so as, in all controversies of religion,
                        the Church is finally to appeal unto them. But, because these original
                        tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and
                        interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read
                        and search them, therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar
                        language of every nation unto which they come, that, the Word of God
                        dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner;
                        and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Protestants have interpreted Article VIII of
                    the Westminster Confession in various ways, of which the VPI doctrine is one.
                    The major doctrines regarding the proper interpretation of Article VIII would
                    appear to be as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The dictation doctrine of inspiration sees God as
                            the author of the Bible and the human writers as mere agents taking
                            dictation. Essentially, God spoke and man wrote it down.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The VPI doctrine differs from the dictation
                            doctrine in that its proponents do not believe that God literally
                            dictated every word of the Bible. VPI proponents believe that when the
                            human authors were writing, they were inspired by God so that what they
                            wrote were the "breathed-out” words of God. This means that while
                            the actual writings retain the personality of the individual authors,
                            they contain the actual words of God.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Limited inspiration sees the Bible as primarily
                            the work of man with "limited" inspiration from God. Under this
                            doctrine, God guides the human authors, but allows them the freedom to
                            express themselves in their works. This view asserts that while there
                            may be factual and historical errors in the Bible, the Holy Spirit
                            guided the authors so that no doctrinal errors resulted from their
                            works.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Westminster Confession is a highly
                    detailed piece of work that lays down the major tenets of the Christian faith in
                    the Calvinist Protestant tradition. Having regard to the principles of
                    construction laid down in <em>Aust</em> and <em>Mackay</em> (Principle (vi)), as well as the fact that
                    Article III of the College’s constitution was drafted by theologians well
                    versed in Christian doctrine, we are of the opinion that the founders of the
                    College intended the Westminster Confession to serve as the fundamental doctrine
                    informing and guiding the work of the College.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     From the submissions made by counsel, we were
                    able to discern that the VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI
                    doctrine which both parties adhere to. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a>, believers in the VPI doctrine believe that
                    the original versions of the Bible as written in Aramic and old Hebrew (the
                    autographs) were divinely inspired. The autographs do not exist anymore, but
                    some translated copies of them (the apographs) are still in existence. On the
                    other hand, proponents of the VPP doctrine go one step further: they believe
                    that some of these apographs (the Textus Receptus manuscripts of the New
                    Testament and the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament) are perfectly preserved
                    copies of the autographs because the scribes who translated them were also
                    divinely inspired. Since the King James Version of the Bible
                    (“KJV”) was translated based on the apographs, adherents of the
                    VPP doctrine believe that the KJV is the most accurate English translation of
                    the bible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the VPP doctrine a deviation from the Confession?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Having carefully considered the position, it
                    seems to us that the College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated
                    from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College
                    right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession. There
                    are four reasons why we have come to this view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     First, although Article VIII stands for the
                    proposition that the original drafts of the Bible were divinely inspired, it is
                    notably silent on the question of the relative accuracy of the translated copies
                    of the Bibles. At the time when the Westminster Confession was written, there
                    were already multiple translated versions of the Bible in various languages
                    (including in English). Hence, the absence of any reference to this issue in
                    Article VIII could have been due to either deliberate silence or a failure to
                    consider this question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Mere difference between the current and
                    original doctrines/practice of a religious institution does not ipso facto
                    amount to a breach of trust. The difference must relate to an essential and
                    fundamental doctrine of the religious institution: see <em>Craigdallie</em> (Principle (ii)). The cases where the courts have
                    found a breach of trust involved situations where the members of the religious
                    institution had abandoned a fundamental principle, or had acted in contravention
                    of it. In <em>Overtoun</em>, the House of Lords found for
                    the minority group because the majority group had abandoned the Establishment
                    principle as well as the position of strict adherence to the Westminster
                    Confession, which were the fundamental doctrines of the Free Church. Similarly,
                    the court in <em>Pearson</em> was minded to order an
                    inquiry as to the fundamental doctrines of the congregation because of the
                    obvious incompatibility of trinitarianism (the original doctrine) with
                    unitarianism. In contrast, the courts have been slow to find that there is a
                    breach of trust where a religious institution adopts a position on a matter not
                    contemplated by its founders and which position is not incompatible with the
                    institution’s fundamental doctrines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Article VIII of the Westminster Confession, as
                    well as the VPI doctrine, deals solely with the divine status of the autographs.
                    In contrast, the VPP doctrine is concerned with the divine status of some
                    particular apographs. Although related, the two doctrines focus on different
                    areas of theology. It is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in
                    the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI
                    doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine. In the absence of anything in
                    the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we
                    hesitate to find that the VPP doctrine is a deviation from the principles
                    contained within the Westminster Confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Second, insofar as the Westminster Confession
                    does not dictate any particular position with regard to the status of the
                    apographs, the Church’s own position in relation to the use of the KJV can
                    also be regarded as a doctrinal position that is neither supported nor
                    contradicted by the Westminster Confession. Charles Seet, the pastor of the
                    Church, admitted during cross examination that the Church itself uses the KJV
                    and has always subscribed to the view that the KJV is the best English
                    translation of the bible because of its textual superiority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It seems to us difficult to resolve, as a
                    matter of theology, whether the Church’s position (endorsing the VPI) is
                    closer to the Westminster Confession than that of the College (endorsing the
                    VPP). Both positions accept the alleged superiority of the KJV, an issue that
                    the Westminster Confession is entirely silent on. Insofar as both positions
                    relate to the question of the accuracy of translated bibles, we are of the
                    opinion that they are not inconsistent with the Westminster
                Confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Third, there is some evidence to suggest
                    that the Church had, at least initially, regarded the VPP doctrine as not
                    inconsistent with the principles contained in the Westminster Confession. The
                    Statement of Reconciliation published by the Church in 2003 states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the past 52 years, Life B-P Church has been holding forth the Word of
                        Life, and upholding the use of the King James Version (KJV) which is the
                        best English translation of the Scriptures, made by godly translators from
                        the best Greek and Hebrew texts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Among all English Bibles today, there is none that can surpass the KJV. We
                        believe that this statement on the KJV being the Word of God, and fully
                        reliable, which was arrived at after the careful deliberation of the Board
                        of Elders, is acceptable by all other members of the Session.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And thus, we should continue to exclusively use the KJV for all ministries
                        of the church and for our members’ use, and refrain from all Modern
                        English versions, like the RSV, NASV and NIV. One of the many deficiencies
                        of these Modern English versions is that they are based on the corrupted
                        Westcott and Hort Greek and Hebrew Text; while the KJV is based on the
                        uncorrupted family of the Greek Received Text and the Masoretic Hebrew
                        Text.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the last few months, a debate has arisen within our church, concerning
                        the Greek Received Text and the Masoretic Hebrew Text underlying the KJV.
                            <em>We have come to the conclusion that neither of the
                            views propounded is dogma but personal conviction or
                            preference</em>. We confess our sins and repent before God that we
                        have caused grief, consternation and confusion, we pray that God will
                        forgive us</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Statement of Reconciliation shows that,
                    as late as 2003, the Church was prepared to accept that personal belief in the
                    VPP doctrine was not inconsistent with adherence to the Westminster Confession.
                    In this respect, we would also point out that the Church’s own
                    constitution requires the Church to take an uncompromising stance against
                    heretical doctrines that it regards as being against the fundamental precepts of
                    the Westminster Confession. Article 4 of the Church’s constitution
                    expressly requires the doctrine of the Church to be aligned with the principles
                    laid down in the Westminster Confession, while Articles 6.8 and 6.9 state
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.8    In loyalty to the revealed Word, we, as an
                            organised portion of the people of God, are obliged to oppose all forms
                            of modernism, cultism, Romantism and false religions. Dialogue for the
                            purpose of reaching a compromise between true Bible believers and
                            representatives of such beliefs is impious, unbiblical, treasonous and
                            unfaithful to the holy God, as He has revealed Himself to us in His
                            infallible, inerrant Word.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.9    We are opposed to all efforts to obscure or wipe
                            out the clear line of separation between these absolutes: truth and
                            error, light and darkness. We refer to such efforts by New Evangelicals,
                            Charismatic Christians, promoters of ecumenical cooperative evangelism
                            and of the social gospel, and all churches and other movements and
                            organisations that are aligned with or sympathetic to the Ecumenical
                            Movement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Statement of Reconciliation was an
                    attempt between the members of the Church to seek a compromise between those who
                    believe in the VPI doctrine and those who believe in the VPP doctrine. Such a
                    compromise would have been barred by the Church’s own constitution if the
                    VPP doctrine was indeed a deviation from the Westminster
                Confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Fourth, it is not disputed that out of the
                    approximately 17 Bible Presbyterian (“B-P”) churches in Singapore,
                    there are nine that support the VPP doctrine (Berean, Berith, Calvary Pandan,
                    Calvary Tengah, Gethsemane, New Life, Tabernacle, True Life and Truth Bible). On
                    the other hand, there are eight B-P churches that have rejected the VPP doctrine
                    (Galilee, Grace, Life Church, Narareth, Olivet, Shalom, Zion,
                    Mt Hermon).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The above-stated B-P churches were all
                    members of the Bible-Presbyterian Church of Singapore (“the
                    Presbytery”) until 1986, when the Presbytery was dissolved, and the
                    members of the Presbytery became independent churches. Article 4 of the
                    Presbytery’s constitution made it clear that its fundamental doctrines
                    were based on the principles contained in the Westminster Confession.
                    Accordingly, although the constitutions of those B-P churches in Singapore are
                    not in evidence, it is fair to infer that those B-P churches would continue to
                    regard the Westminster Confession as their fundamental doctrines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Pursuant to the principles laid down in
                        <em>Overtoun</em>, the question of whether a certain
                    doctrine is in accord with the fundamental doctrines of a religious institution
                    is purely a question of construction. Nonetheless, while the beliefs of a
                    majority group is not determinative, it is a factor that cannot be ignored. In
                    this case, neither party has adduced expert evidence on the question of the
                    compatibility of the VPP doctrine with the Westminster Confession. The closest
                    approximation we have to expert evidence is the expert opinions of the pastors
                    of the various churches who adhere to the Westminster Confession. Accordingly,
                    some weight should be given to the fact that half of the B-P churches believe
                    that the VPP doctrine is consistent with the Westminster
                Confession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In light of the above, we find that the
                    Respondents (who, importantly, bear the burden of proof (see above at [95-105]))
                    have not shown that the Appellant’s adoption of the VPP doctrine is
                    inconsistent with the fundamental doctrines of the College.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">G.   Does the College’s teaching of the VPP doctrine
                constitute a deviation from the objects of the charitable purpose trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It is conceptually possible for the
                    fundamental doctrines of the College to differ from the objects of the
                    charitable purpose trust over the Premises. In the present case the charitable
                    purpose trust over the Premises was not established by a single identifiable
                    donor whose intent could be easily ascertained, be it by way of a trust deed or
                    any other less formal way. Rather, the funds received to acquire the Premises
                    were raised by donations from members of the Christian community whose
                    intentions could not be ascertained with any degree of certainty. But what is
                    clear is that the appeals for donations were made in the joint names of the
                    Church and the College, without any further elaboration. There was no indication
                    as to whether any one body would exercise any form of control over the other.
                    Neither was there any specific reference to any religious doctrine other than
                    the fact that both entities were Bible Presbyterian entities. In such
                    circumstances, the objects of the College, as well as those of the Church, would
                    serve as strong evidence of the presumed objects of the charitable purpose
                    trust, because it would be natural and reasonable to infer that the donors
                    intended their donations to benefit both the College and the
                Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As we see it, the charitable purpose trust
                    upon which the Premises are impressed, as far as the College is concerned, must
                    be that the Premises be used in accordance with its Constitution. There is
                    nothing to suggest that the College can only enjoy the use of the Premises if it
                    is aligned to the Church in terms of the particular translation of the Bible
                    used. It must not be overlooked that the College was and is intended to serve
                    the needs of all Presbyterian churches in Singapore. As mentioned above at
                        <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a>, these churches are divided as
                    far as the VPI and the VPP doctrines are concerned. In the light of our finding
                    (see <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a> above) that the College has not
                    deviated from its fundamental doctrines/tenets, it is entitled to continue using
                    the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As a concluding remark we would make these
                    further observations. The various fundraising events that took place between
                    1957 and 2000 were made in the name of both the Church and the College.
                    Undoubtedly, when the donations were received, the donors, as well as the
                    members of the Church and the College, did not anticipate that a doctrinal
                    dispute like the present would arise between the Church and the College. Indeed,
                    it is even possible that all the parties involved assumed that the Church and
                    the College would forever be united in terms of doctrine. However, this is very
                    different from saying that the College commits a breach of the charitable
                    purpose trust to which the Premises are impressed with when it ceases to be
                    aligned with the Church in terms of doctrine. The evidence produced by the
                    Church only shows that the Church and the College shared a special and close
                    relationship. There is nothing to suggest that the College was meant to be
                    subordinated to the Church in either administration or doctrine. We would
                    reiterate that the College was established not only to serve the needs of the
                    Church but also the needs of the other Presbyterian churches in Singapore. As
                    stated before, the Presbyterian churches in Singapore are divided over VPI and
                    VPP. Given these considerations, we find that the College’s status as a
                    beneficiary under that purpose trust over the Premises was not conditioned on
                    its continued doctrinal alignment with the Church.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    For the above mentioned reasons, we allow
                    the appeal. We will hear the parties on the exact orders which are necessary to
                    give effect to the relief claimed by the Appellants in Suit 278. In order to
                    avoid further controversies, the parties may consider it necessary to draw up a
                    more detailed arrangement than that set out in the 1970 Agreement, as to how the
                    Premises are to be maintained and used by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The parties are also requested, within the
                    next fortnight, to let us have their written submissions on the question of
