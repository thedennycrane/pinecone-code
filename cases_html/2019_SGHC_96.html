In essence, it is malware.

Sometime in the last quarter of 2014, Pelliccione asked Woon if he would be interested in leaving HT for ReaQta. While the latter declined the offer, he “did not want to close the door on this opportunity” and asked Pelliccione to allow him to continue to “observe and experience the market response to ReaQta-Core before deciding to take the plunge”.

At trial, Woon could give no satisfactory reason for why he would need an official ReaQta email account, if not to facilitate his assisting in the marketing of ReaQta-Core to external parties. Woon claimed that the ReaQta email account was set up only so that he could be copied into correspondence relating to the marketing of ReaQta-Core.

Specifically, Woon says that Vincenzetti and Russo had consented orally to his involvement in ReaQta. In his closing submissions, however, Woon relies on the defence of acquiescence, rather than the legal concepts of waiver and or estoppel. Be that as it may, I turn now to consider the merits of Woon’s arguments as advanced in his closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As contended by Woon, the defence of acquiescence operates where a person having a right, in the knowledge that another person is committing an act infringing that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act to believe that he assents to its being committed. A person so standing by cannot afterwards complain of the act: <span class="font-italic">Towa Corp v ASM Technology Singapore Pte Ltd and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 771 at [141]. Woon argues that HT acquiesced to his engagement in general freelance work of a “defensive” nature. By doing so, Woon contends that HT had acquiesced to Woon’s involvement in ReaQta (which develops cybersecurity technologies which are “defensive” in nature). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Quite tellingly, Woon does not say that HT had acquiesced to the Woon’s involvement in ReaQta <span class="font-italic">specifically</span>.

</div> I accept his evidence. Further, if Woon were as concerned about his engagement with Xsecpro as he claimed to be, he would have made some attempt to negotiate an express stipulation for it, especially since this meeting was held prior to his entering into the Employment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Even if I were to accept that Woon had informed Vincenzetti and Russo about his involvement in “defensive” solutions and that both men had consented to the same, I do not think that can be taken as a blank cheque authorisation of any and all <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> involvement in “defensive” solutions – much less a defensive solution developed by a former employee – Pelliccione. Woon admitted that after the 23 May 2012 meeting, he never mentioned his “freelance” work ever again.

I accept Russo’s explanation; it is perfectly reasonable that at that stage while HT was still weighing its options, it did not see fit to burn the bridges prematurely. In any case, I note that this discovery came at the tail end of Woon’s employment. Even then, quite promptly thereafter, on 13 April 2015, HT demanded that Woon terminate his involvement with ReaQta.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I therefore find that HT had <span class="font-italic">not</span> acquiesced to Woon’s involvement in ReaQta. Nor was Woon in any way induced by any statement or omission of HT to commence and subsequently continue his involvement in ReaQta. For completeness, I should add that I agree with HT that HT cannot be said to have waived its rights and/or be estopped on insisting on its legal rights either. Broadly, under these doctrines, HT must know of the relevant facts, and make an unequivocal representation to Woon that it is electing to waive its rights or that it will not enforce its legal rights in the future: <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 317 at [54] and [57]. Based on the discussion above, Woon has failed to prove these matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In sum, I find that Woon engaged in the business of ReaQta by advising it and actually marketing ReaQta-Core, and that he had done so well within the period of his employment with HT. This was done without the prior written consent of HT, and HT did not acquiesce to his involvement with ReaQta.

</div> In coming to this view, I acknowledge HT’s contention that the definition of “Competitor” within the meaning of cl 12(a) of the Employment Agreement may be read to include a company like ReaQta which deals with “defensive” technologies. I discuss this further at [81] below, but for the issue at hand, that contractual definition is not directly pertinent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, while HT and ReaQta might not be competitors (in that their products are not substitutes for each other), I think it right to say that an employee’s outside employment may inflict harm on his existing employer’s business not just where he participates in a competing business, but also where he participates in the development and promotion of a rival product which has as its sole <span class="font-italic">raison d’être</span> the neutralisation of the sole function of his existing employer’s product. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The function of “offensive” software like Galileo is to allow the operator to surreptitiously gain access to the target computer so as to gather intelligence on the target. It is of first importance that the “offensive” software evades detection. If the target is alerted, it might deliberately change its behaviour so as to feed false intelligence to the operator.

</div> Galileo was marketed as being near-invisible to “defensive” software. If it were to be detected, detections were usually “solved” within three days by modifying and mutating Galileo’s code, after which Galileo would become invisible to the anti-virus which detected it until that anti-virus was further updated again.

Its “behavioural analysis approach” allowed it to detect “offensive” threats based on their behaviour and not just their signatures, allowing it to detect even fast-mutating threats without the need for constant updates, making it, in Woon’s words, “future-proof”.

</div> HT argues that the “business or activity” carried on by HT is the “cyber intelligence and security” industry. Therefore, any company in the cybersecurity industry would fall within the provision, regardless of whether it is engaged in “offensive” or “defensive” technologies. Given the highly specialised nature of the business, and the customer base which is limited to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the one-year time frame and the unlimited geographical scope do not render the clause unreasonable. As such, Woon, by getting involved in the business of ReaQta, breached the term.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legitimate proprietary interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I begin my analysis by considering the question of whether cl 12(b) protected a legitimate proprietary interest. In <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [92], the Court of Appeal set out the general proposition that where an employer’s confidential information or trade connection are already directly protected by other contractual covenants, the remaining function of the non-competition clause in question would just be to inhibit competition, and would be invalid as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [<span class="font-italic">Stratech Systems Ltd v Nyam Chiu Shin</span><span class="font-italic"> (alias Yan Qiuxin) and others</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 579] reaffirms (at [48]–[49]) the proposition that where the protection of confidential information or trade secrets is already covered by <span class="font-italic">another</span> clause in the contract, the covenantee will have to demonstrate that the restraint of trade clause in question covers a legitimate proprietary interest <span class="font-italic">over and above</span> the protection of confidential information or trade secrets. Indeed, this proposition is, in our view, a <span class="font-italic">general</span> one and would apply equally in the context of other legitimate proprietary interests (for example, that of trade connection …) as well. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Clause 11 of the Employment Agreement restricts the unauthorised use, disclosure, copying, extracting, translating, publication or communication of “trade secrets or confidential or business information”. In so far as HT relies on “confidential information” as the legitimate proprietary interest to be protected by cl 12(b), this is clearly covered by cl 11, and does not constitute an interest <span class="font-italic">over and above</span> that directly protected by cl 11 of the Employment Agreement. That being the case, I hold that cl 12(b) cannot be relied on to protect HT’s interest in its confidential information: <span class="font-italic">Stratech Systems Ltd v Nyam Chiu Shin (alias Yan Qiuxin) and others</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 579 (“<span class="font-italic">Stratech</span>”) as affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [92].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for cl 13(b), that clause directly protects HT’s interest in its trade connection by restraining former employees like Woon from canvassing or soliciting business from its existing customers and its suppliers, being parties which had dealings with HT six months prior to their termination; these parties are defined to fall within the meaning of “Restricted Person” under cl 13(a): see [85] below. In this regard, HT submits that insofar as the general proposition set out in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span> is said to extend to trade connection (being a legitimate proprietary interest other than confidential information and trade secrets), that extension is <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> because the <span class="font-italic">ratio </span>of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Stratech </span>(referred to in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span> at [92]) only dealt with the employer’s interest in protecting its confidential information and trade secrets, and should not be applied when the legitimate interest in question is trade connection. Alternatively, HT argues that even if the general proposition in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span> applied, cl 12 <span class="font-italic">does </span>cover a legitimate proprietary interest over and above that covered by cl 13(b) because the latter does not protect HT’s trade connection with potential customers with which HT was having ongoing negotiations, or existing customers which did not have dealings with HT in the six months prior to termination.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Given the clearly defined scope of the non-solicitation restraint in cl 13, I am doubtful that there is any legitimate proprietary interest in HT’s trade connection remaining to be protected by cl 12. However, even if I were to accept that cl 12(b) protects HT’s interest in maintaining its trade connection, HT’s case still fails because the restrictions in cl 12 go beyond what is necessary to protect that interest. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasonableness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To elaborate, on the assumption that there is such a legitimate proprietary interest in trade connection to be protected, the question to be determined is whether cl 12 is reasonable in scope as between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Crucially, the time for ascertaining the reasonableness of a restrictive covenant is at the time it is entered into: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [72]. As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers &amp; Gifts Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 27 at [87], the restrictive covenant is construed bearing in mind the circumstances which the parties reasonably contemplated at the time they entered into the contract. The positive consequence of this is that if a restrictive covenant is reasonable as between the parties bearing in mind those circumstances, it will not become void simply because it could also be construed to cover unlikely situations outside their reasonable contemplation. However, if a restrictive covenant is unreasonably wide as between the parties bearing in mind those circumstances, it will not be saved simply because the covenantee proposes to breach an aspect of the restrictive covenant which is, in fact, reasonable as between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Where an employer seeks to proscribe the types of business in which an employee may become engaged once employment is over, he can do so if he can establish a close connection between the restriction and the work done by the employee prior to leaving. Moreover, the employer may only protect himself from activities by his employee <span class="font-italic">which might reasonably affect the customer connection which has been built up</span> (Alexandra Kamerling &amp; Chris Goodwill, <span class="font-italic">Restrictive Covenants under Common and Competition Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2010) at p 184).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 With that, I turn to the first question of what HT’s business is. On a plain reading of cl 12(a), the “business or activity” of HT may well be treated as having a scope as wide as the entire cybersecurity and intelligence industry. Taking this wide view, any company in the cybersecurity and intelligence industry may fall within the definition of a “Competitor”. This is regardless of whether it is involved in “offensive” or “defensive” technologies. As I stated at [62] above, a company involved in “defensive” technologies is not even HT’s competitor in the economic sense of the word. As Woon submits, this would include companies dealing with “defensive” software programmes such as McAfee or Symantec or Kaspersky.

</div>
</div>
</div> Potentially, such companies would not have any interest in HT’s trade connection with customers of “offensive solutions”. As such, I do not see a close connection between the business HT is in, with the businesses Woon is prevented from engaging in. Given what the parties would have reasonably contemplated, the industrial scope is far too broad. Indeed, HT argues for this wide reading for the obvious reason that otherwise, ReaQta would not fall within its ambit and Woon would not be in breach of cl 12. As between the parties, this clause is unreasonable.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Next, I turn to the restricted activities. In relation to any such competitor, cl 12(b) prohibits Woon not just from seeking employment with or providing his services to it, but also engaging in any business with it. In terms of employment, it is not confined to preventing Woon from performing roles which might affect HT’s trade connection. The activities encompassed by cl 12(b) go beyond those which might reasonably affect the customer connection which HT has built up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I should also mention that there is no geographical limit imposed by cl 12. The prohibition is worldwide. By Annex A of the Employment Agreement, Woon was to operate in the Asia-Pacific region. It is not seriously disputed that Woon was engaged primarily in the region. Again, in my view, the clause is far wider than necessary to restrain Woon from affecting the trade connection which have been built up. Given the lack of any geographical constraint, the duration of one year is also excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Hence, cl 12(b) is a wide prohibition in restraint of trade which is unreasonable, and therefore void and unenforceable. By working for ReaQta while he was an employee of HT to develop and market ReaQta-Core, Woon was in breach of the implied duty of good faith and fidelity. However, post-termination, Woon did not owe any such duty not to harm HT’s interest. Clause 12(b), being a non-competition clause, serves an entirely different purpose. Essentially, it is to protect HT’s trade connection with its suppliers or customers from being poached by a former employee to the benefit of his new employer. To stretch cl 12(b) such that it restrains the employee from engaging in business with another employer – even where that employer does not compete with and has no interest in HT’s trade connection with its suppliers or customers – would be a restraint that goes beyond what is necessary in order to protect its trade connection.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Clause 13(b) of the Employment Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Clause 13 of the Employment Agreement is a non-solicitation clause which restricts employees from doing business with any “Restricted Person”.

</div> Given this context, it was incumbent on HT to show or explain how it was Woon’s actions that led to sales falling through in 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my view, HT fails to do so. For example, HT could have adduced correspondence with potential clients explaining that they had decided not to proceed with Galileo after Woon had informed them of its vulnerability to ReaQta-Core. There was no evidence of this sort. If indeed sales were indeed falling through at an abnormal rate, I would have expected someone from HT, including Maglietta, to have taken notice and to have asked for client feedback as to why purchases were abandoned, or not closed. Again, there was absolutely no evidence to that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Pertinently, Woon was not the only source in the market for information about ReaQta-Core and its capabilities. Indeed, ReaQta itself was marketing ReaQta-Core. There was also evidence to suggest that at least one <span class="font-italic">other</span> sales consultant of HT, Velasco, was also involved in ReaQta and ReaQta-Core. While Velasco’s activities mostly involved entities in the Americas, given the closely-knit nature of the law enforcement sector (as HT itself went to great lengths to establish), information sharing surely extended across regions. In the circumstances, it was insufficient for HT to simply assert that Woon had caused<span class="font-italic"> </span>the loss of profits in the Asia-Pacific region simply by inference from the fact of his involvement in ReaQta. On the evidence before me, there was simply nothing to make good two crucial links in the chain of causation: (i) that the loss of profits was in fact due to clients and potential clients dropping Galileo because they had found out that ReaQta-Core could effectively neutralise it; and (ii) that the affected clients and potential clients had found this out from Woon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In sum, HT has not proven that Woon’s breaches of cl 10 of the Employment Agreement and his implied duty of good faith and fidelity were a substantial cause of the loss of profits suffered by HT in 2014. Therefore, I dismiss the claim for loss of profits. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damage to business reputation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 HT also claims that it suffered damage to its business reputation. On HT’s case, ReaQta-Core “annulled the most significant competitive advantages” of Galileo, and in marketing such a product, Woon “destroyed the trust that customers and potential customers had in HT”.

</div> The hacking attack and its effects were widely reported, and went directly to HT’s competence and effectiveness <span class="font-italic">as a company</span>, as opposed to the marketing of ReaQta-Core, which went only to the effectiveness of the contemporaneous version of RCS at the time, Galileo. In my judgment, any adverse impact Woon’s marketing of ReaQta-Core might have had must have paled in comparison to the fallout from the July 2015 hacking attack. I therefore reject Merini’s assertion that the damage caused by Woon’s acts was “significant”.

According to HT, “[b]ecause of ReaQta-core, it was neither commercially viable nor ethically acceptable to continue using any element of the Galileo”, with the result that it had to be completely re-engineered from scratch, a process involving the re-writing of some 1.5m lines of code.

</div> On his part, Woon denies that his breaches had necessitated a complete re-writing of the RCS code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The issue before me is whether Woon’s breach can be said to have caused the re-engineering of RCS so that he should be liable for the cost of doing so. On that issue, I find against HT for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 First, HT was unable to prove that the emergence of ReaQta-Core required a complete re-write of the RCS software. There was no reason why the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> code had to be re-engineered “from scratch” just because a particular “defensive” software, ReaQta-Core, had detected Galileo. On Vincenzetti’s own evidence, it was not uncommon for even generic antivirus software to detect Galileo from time to time; HT even maintained an “Invisibility List” tracking the brands of antivirus software which were able to detect Galileo at any given time.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In this regard, HT’s point appears to be that the threat posed by ReaQta-Core to Galileo stood in a different category from that posed by generic antivirus software because its behaviour-based (as opposed to signature-based) detection technology allowed it to consistently detect malware like Galileo without the need for constant updates (see [65] above). This might have been a rather compelling point had it been <span class="font-italic">prove</span><span class="font-italic">n</span> that ReaQta-Core’s behavioural approach to detection (or, for that matter, any other peculiar aspect of ReaQta-Core’s design or operation) was such as to require a more fundamental overhaul of the RCS instead of the usual piecemeal patch updates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Unfortunately, this point is not made out on the evidence. In particular, there is a complete dearth of any evidence whatsoever on what are, in my view, two crucial points: first, that HT had, at the time, considered ReaQta-Core a mortal threat to Galileo; and relatedly, the measures that would have had to be taken in order to resolve Galileo’s vulnerability to ReaQta-Core. Instead, HT merely asserts that since ReaQta-Core was an “antidote” to Galileo, the “only prudent course of action for HT would have been to re-engineer the software from ground up”.

I note that HT had originally intended to call an expert on information security, Dr Francesco Schifilliti, to give evidence on ReaQta-Core’s ability to <span class="font-italic">permanently neutralise</span> Galileo and the technical reasons for why it could do so. Unfortunately, Dr Schifilliti was eventually not called as a witness, and his evidence on this point is not before me.

I reject Vincenzetti’s assertion that HT had “resolved” to proceed with re-engineering the RCS software in February 2015 when it found out about Woon’s involvement with ReaQta. On the evidence before me, there is nothing to prove that the threat that ReaQta-Core posed was so significantly or qualitatively different from the threat posed by any other “defensive” software on the Invisibility List that it would necessitate a complete re-write, and that a decision to proceed with a complete re-write took place before July 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the premises, I dismiss HT’s claim for the cost of re-engineering the RCS software.

With respect to the personnel costs, Merini’s instructions were that the re-engineering of Galileo took some three months.

As discussed above, what HT has failed to do is to prove that Woon caused the losses claimed, and HT has not proven the quantum of its losses. In other words, orthodox compensatory damages are possible, but that there is insufficiency of evidence to support the claims for such damages. As the first requirement is not fulfilled, there is no basis to award <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park </span>damages.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Given the discussion on the heads of damages above, HT has not proven its losses arising from Woon’s pre-termination breaches. In these circumstances, I am of the view that an award of nominal damages is appropriate. This is to affirm that there is an “infraction of a legal right”, which while it gives HT “no right to any real damages at all”, gives HT “a right to the verdict or judgment” because of the infringement of the legal right: <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Steamship “Mediana” v The Owners, Master and Crew of the Lightship “Comet” </span>[1990] AC 113 at 116.

The only other defence raised by HT was that it was not liable to pay Woon because of Woon’s breaches of the Employment Agreement. But the authorities are clear that an employer is generally not entitled to withhold payment of salary just because the employee is in breach of the employment agreement (<span class="font-italic">Schonk Antonius Martinus Mattheus and another v Enholco Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2016] 2 SLR 881 at [15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]n employer may claim damages for any breach of duty by its employee but such a breach will not by itself disentitle the employee to his or her salary.
