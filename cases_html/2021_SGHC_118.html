Construction Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of building and construction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The second defendant Aegis Building &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (“the Second defendant” or “Aegis”) is a company incorporated in Singapore and its principal activities are said to be in structural repairs, process and industrial plant engineering design and consultancy services. At all material times, the majority shareholder and managing director of Aegis was (and still is) Yeong Wai Teck (“the First defendant” or “Yeong”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Ong Beng Yong (“the Third defendant” or “Ong”) is a representative of the plaintiff. While the plaintiff alleged that Ong was at the material time employed as a project manager with a limited scope of authority, Aegis and the First defendant averred that Ong was more than just a project manager and did in fact have authority to enter into contracts for and on behalf of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 5 May 2017, the plaintiff commenced Suit No 412 of 2017 and Suit No 164 of 2019 (previously DC No 1214 of 2017) against Aegis for sums allegedly due under four construction projects, namely the Parklane Suites Project, the Changi Airport Project, the Bedok Project (collectively known as “the Three Projects”) and the Punggol Project. For the Punggol Project, Aegis denied that it had contracted with the plaintiff. Instead, Aegis alleged that it was its related company, ASR Building &amp; Conservation Pte Ltd (“ASR”), which contracted with the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff should be looking to ASR and not Aegis for the sums due. As for the Three Projects, Aegis averred that it had not instructed the plaintiff to carry out some of the works and as such the plaintiff was not entitled to claim for such sums; as for the remaining works for which sums were due, they were contra-charged, set-off and/or paid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Despite Aegis filing a defence in respect of the Three Projects for Suit No 164 of 2019 on 26 May 2017, the plaintiff served payment claims under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) on Aegis on 26 March 2018 for works it had allegedly done for the Bedok and Parklane Suites Projects. As Aegis did not serve a payment response before the due date prescribed under the Act, the plaintiff obtained a favourable adjudication determination in respect of the Bedok and Parklane Suites Projects on 30 April 2018 and 11 May 2018 respectively (referred to as “the Bedok AD” and “the Parklane Suites AD”). In May 2018, Aegis made payment to the plaintiff pursuant to the Bedok AD and the Parklane Suites AD. In Suit No 163 of 2019 (previously DC No 1461 of 2018) filed on 21 May 2018, Aegis sought to recover all the monies it paid to the plaintiff under the Bedok AD and the Parklane Suites AD on the basis of breach of contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, set-off agreements mentioned at [11]) or restitution under the law of unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At around this time, on 21 May 2018, the plaintiff commenced the present suit, Suit No 530 of 2018 (“Suit 530”), against all three defendants for <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> unlawful means conspiracy between all or any of them. The plaintiff alleged that the three defendants conspired to cause losses to the plaintiff by fabricating written documents to unlawfully extricate Aegis from its obligation to pay for work done for the four construction projects. For Suit 530, the plaintiff obtained interlocutory judgment in default of appearance against the Third Defendant on 17 July 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 All four suits, namely Suit No 412 of 2017, Suit No 164 of 2019, Suit No 163 of 2019 and Suit 530, have been consolidated in Suit 530. In its consolidated Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) dated 14 June 2019 (“SOC”), the plaintiff seeks <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> sums due under the four construction projects, a declaration that certain documents are sham documents and damages for unlawful means conspiracy. In its counterclaim, Aegis seeks recovery of a sum of $153,872.14, which sum it paid to the plaintiff pursuant to the Bedok AD and the Parklane Suites AD.

A set-off agreement, however, differs totally from a quotation.

At this trial, the 1st Defendant and [Aegis] have shown this Honourable Court many quotations in their bid to prove that [Ong] had the authority to sign the 5 alleged set-off agreements, just like [Ong] was given the authority to sign and issue quotations to [the plaintiff’s] customers. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97.

From the above, it is clear that the plaintiff has completely moved away from its position that <span class="font-italic">all</span> contracts (save the quotation) entered into by the Third defendant on its behalf required the prior authorisation or approval of the plaintiff and/or Gan. Instead, the plaintiff accepts that the Third defendant had authority to bind the plaintiff for certain contracts, drawing a distinction between agreements that generate business and revenue and agreements that pertain to the setting-off of debts. Quite apart from the fact that this distinction in the type of contracts for which the Third defendant was given authority was completely absent from its pleadings, there is a paucity of evidence that the authority of the Third defendant was so limited.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is in this context that I proceed with the analysis on whether the Third defendant had actual or apparent authority to enter into the 5 set-off agreements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ong was a de facto director of the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In support of its position that the 5 set-off agreements were binding on the plaintiff, the First defendant and Aegis submitted that the Third defendant had actual authority to bind the plaintiff as either a partner within the meaning of s 1(1) of the Partnership Act (Cap 391, 1994 Rev Ed) or a de facto director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As a starting point, the defendants’ argument on the authority of the Third defendant to bind the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">qua</span> partner is misconceived.

</div> However, based on the evidence, I am unable to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendants had combined to fabricate the set-off agreements after 19 November 2015. The email on which the plaintiff relies (see [49]–[50]) is equally, if not more, consistent with the defendants’ account that negotiations were still ongoing as to the best way to effect the set-offs. Even though there did not appear to be evidence of the defendants having sent the set-off agreements to Gan until sometime in 2017, I do not think that this is in any way determinative of the plaintiff’s claim of an unlawful means conspiracy. As the defendants submitted, the emails show at the very least that Gan was aware of a proposal to set-off certain charges against invoices for the Three Projects. In fact, Gan was agreeable to the plaintiff being liable for those charges.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Although I was mindful that both parties appeared to implicitly agree on the use of extrinsic evidence to aid in the determination of the identity of the contracting parties in the quotation, I was more circumspect on the use of such extrinsic evidence in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [125] and [128]–[129] (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”), the Court of Appeal held that extrinsic evidence is admissible in aid of contractual interpretation if (a) it is relevant, (b) reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and (c) relate to a clear or obvious context. In addition to the fact that the extrinsic evidence relied on by the parties in the present case is likely to be inadmissible for non-compliance with one or more of the requirements set out above, I find the extrinsic evidence to be equivocal. For instance, the email correspondences from 11 to 13 March 2015 merely expresses on its face Gan’s uncertainty as to whether the counterparty is Aegis or ASR. I find the emails to be of limited assistance, if at all, in proving what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [127]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Instead, I look at the quotation itself and the terms of the quotation. While the quotation was directed to the attention of ASR’s directors and the company stamps of both ASR and Aegis were on the quotation, it is not disputed that the quotation was addressed to Aegis.

There was insufficient evidence, if at all, to show on a balance of probabilities that Jianlong was given express authority to enter into the quotation on behalf of Aegis, or that he had such authority implied from the nature of his office or from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case (see Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Hely</span><span class="font-italic">-Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd</span> [1968] 1 QB 549 at 583–584 (“<span class="font-italic">Hely</span><span class="font-italic">-Hutchinson</span>”), cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Banque </span><span class="font-italic">Nationale de Paris v Tan Nancy and another</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 726 (“<span class="font-italic">Banque </span><span class="font-italic">Nationale</span>”) at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 While the plaintiff took the position that Jianlong had implied actual authority “from the position he was in”,

</div>
</div> it is not at all clear to me what position of Jianlong the plaintiff is referring to. Insofar as the plaintiff is relying on Jianlong’s position as “representative of Aegis”, the plaintiff has fallen far short in showing that the office of “representative of Aegis” in itself carried with it the authority to sign quotations without the sanction of the board (see <span class="font-italic">Hely</span><span class="font-italic">-Hutchinson</span> at 584, cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Banque </span><span class="font-italic">Nationale</span> at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jianlong did not have apparent or ostensible authority</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I deal next with the plaintiff’s submission that Jianlong had apparent or ostensible authority to sign the quotation on behalf of Aegis.

</div> This context is crucial when evaluating the evidence adduced by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Dealing first with the evidence at [64(b)] and [64(d)], Jianlong’s involvement in the negotiation, amending and finalising of the quotation does not in itself assist in the inquiry of whether Jianlong had apparent authority as it does not speak to the capacity in which Jianlong was involved in the process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is no surprise then that the plaintiff in its submissions repeatedly point to the 28 February 2015 meeting minutes as evidence that Jianlong was involved in the process as a representative of Aegis, and not ASR. However, just as the plaintiff asks this court to view Aegis’ conduct as a whole, the 28 February 2015 meeting minutes ought also to be viewed in its proper context. In his cross-examination, the First defendant explained that in the cover email in which the minutes were attached, Jianlong had an ASR email address, unlike the other recipients of the email from Aegis.

</div> Given the surrounding circumstances, the 28 February 2015 meeting minutes cannot be construed as a representation that Jianlong had the authority to act on Aegis’ behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff’s reliance on the email correspondences at [64(c)] is also neither here nor there, given the plaintiff’s acknowledgement that Jianlong was emailing in his capacity as managing director of ASR. As such, I find that there was no mistaken belief on which Aegis could be said to have acquiesced such that the First defendant’s silence would count as a representation (see <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati 5”</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1114 (“<span class="font-italic">Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati 5</span>”) at [14] and [16]). If at all, the mistaken belief pertained solely to the identity of the counterparty in the quotation, and not to the capacity in which Jianlong was authorised to act.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As for Jianlong’s affixing of the corporate stamp of Aegis on the quotation, the defendants referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">Sigma Cable Co (Pte) Ltd v NEI Parsons Ltd</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 403 (“<span class="font-italic">Sigma Cable</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Sigma Cable</span> at [40], it was held that the fact that an agent made use of the principal’s purchase order forms and rubber stamps could not be a representation of the agent’s authority to act on the principal’s behalf unless the principal knew and allowed the agent to use them, and the third party could prove as such. In the present case, the plaintiff has not established through the evidence adduced that Aegis knew and allowed Jianlong to use the corporate stamp of Aegis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72  As the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was insufficient to clothe Jianlong with apparent authority to bind Aegis, I therefore find that the quotation was not binding on Aegis. Having found that the quotation was not binding on Aegis and given that the plaintiff relies solely on the quotation to establish a contractual relationship with Aegis, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim against Aegis for breach of contract with regard to the Punggol Project. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: Unlawful means conspiracy in respect of the Purchase Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for the plaintiff’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy, it fails again at the first hurdle. The plaintiff failed to establish by the evidence adduced that the defendants had combined to commit unlawful acts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the defendants fabricated the Purchase Order by way of back-dating. In fact, the evidence was that the Purchase Order was issued on 24 March 2015 to govern the relationship between ASR and the plaintiff in respect of the Punggol Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74  I accept the testimony of Foo who explained that the Purchase Order was issued after he had found mistakes in the quotation, namely, the quotation was addressed to Aegis instead of ASR, and included a profit sharing component when it should not have.

Rather than supporting the plaintiff’s case that the Purchase Order must have been falsified as there was no doubt in the parties’ minds as to who the contracting parties were after the quotation was signed, the evidence mentioned above appear to be more consistent with Foo’s testimony that he issued the Purchase Order immediately after he had realised that the addressee in the quotation was wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The parties’ subsequent conduct also does not support the plaintiff’s case that the Purchase Order was falsified to “retrospectively alter the contracting party from [Aegis] to ASR” (see [19] above). Even though the plaintiff pointed to an instance in June 2015 when Aegis made payment of $53,181.52 for the Punggol Project directly to the plaintiff, the First defendant explained that Aegis was paying this amount to the plaintiff on behalf of ASR.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Based on the foregoing, I find the plaintiff’s claim of unlawful means conspiracy to be wholly unmeritorious. The plaintiff failed to prove to the requisite standard that the Purchase Order was falsified. Rather, the parties’ conduct before and subsequent to the Purchase Order supports the defendants’ case that the Purchase Order was authentic, the counterparty for the Punggol Project was ASR and not Aegis, and the plaintiff through this action is now belatedly looking to Aegis for payment due to ASR’s insolvency.

As for the counterclaim, Aegis is entitled to judgment in the sum of $153,872.14, with interest thereon at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 21 May 2018 to the date of payment (see [54] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The court was informed that the parties had each made an Offer to Settle (“OTS”) to the other party in the course of these proceedings. This was done pursuant to O 22A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The plaintiff’s OTS to the First and Second defendants dated 4 June 2020 was for them to pay a settlement sum of $385,000 in full and final settlement of the plaintiff’s claim and the Second defendant’s counterclaim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The First and Second defendants’ OTS dated 24 June 2019 (“the 24 June 2019 Offer”) offered the plaintiff (i) a sum of $150,000 in full and final settlement of the plaintiff’s claim and (ii) the Second defendant’s counterclaim would be discontinued if the OTS was accepted, (iii) with each party bearing its own costs. Should the plaintiff accept this offer after 8 July 2019, the plaintiff was to bear the First and Second defendants’ costs in relation to Suit 530 and the related suits on an indemnity basis from 24 June 2019 up until the date of acceptance of the offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The First and Second defendants’ OTS was followed by a Calderbank letter dated 29 May 2020 (“the 29 May 2020 Offer”). While this letter did not fall within the statutory regime of OTS under O 22A of the Rules of Court as it did not follow the form that an OTS must take, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Form 33 of Appendix A to the Rules of Court (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit Ltd (formerly known as Singapore Bus Services Limited) v Koh Swee Ann</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 365 (“<span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span>”) at [22]), it is a Calderbank letter of the type identified by <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span><span class="font-italic"> v Calderbank</span> [1976] Fam 93, being a letter marked “without prejudice save as to costs” from the two defendants to the plaintiff setting out the terms of an offer to settle (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span> at [16]). The offer here was for payment of a sum of $100,000 from the two defendants to the plaintiff, with each party bearing its own costs. This offer was to expire on 5 June 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The First and Second defendants did not accept the plaintiff’s OTS. The plaintiff also did not accept the 24 June 2019 Offer or the 29 May 2020 Offer. As the 29 May 2020 Offer was not accepted by 5 June 2020, it expired. However, as can be seen from the terms as set out at [84], the 29 May 2020 Offer could still be accepted after 8 July 2019. Unless the formal mechanism for withdrawal of an offer set out in O 22A r 3 of the Rules of Court is followed, the 29 May 2020 Offer can still be accepted by the plaintiff before the disposal of the claim (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span> at [19]–[20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Order 22A r 9 of the Rules of Court states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs (O. 22A, r. 9)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9</span>.—(1) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Where an offer to settle made by a plaintiff —</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(b) is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date an offer to settle was served and costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Where an offer to settle made by a defendant —</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(255,255,255)"><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed, O 22A r 9(1) has no application. Instead, as the First and Second defendants succeeded in obtaining a dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim and the Second defendant obtained judgment on its counterclaim in the sum of $153,872.14, O 22A r 9(3) comes into play. Based on the 24 June 2019 Offer, the two defendants are therefore entitled to costs on a standard basis for the claim and for the Second defendant’s counterclaim up to 24 June 2019. From 25 June 2019 onwards, the two defendants are entitled to costs from the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. The 29 May 2020 Offer does not detract from the above analysis. In fact, it provides further justification for my finding above as both offers by the two defendants were considerably more favourable to the plaintiff than the outcome in this judgment. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kris Chew Yee Fong and Isabel Su Hongling (Zenith Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wah Hsien-Wen, Terence and Tan Chor Huang, Janet (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the first and second defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
