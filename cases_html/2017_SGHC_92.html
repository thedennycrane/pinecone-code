JS Athletics was in the business of conducting sports training at schools and stadiums and selling sports accessories. The appellant worked for the respondent from 2008 to 2009. The parties disputed the circumstances under which the appellant left the employment of the respondent. The appellant claimed that he resigned while the respondent claimed that the appellant was summarily dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Web post in question was posted on the respondent’s business website on 8 November 2009 after the appellant left the respondent’s employ. The respondent updated the Web post thereafter at various points. He did so after the hearing before the District Judge and pending the outcome of the present appeal, though not in wholly accurate terms, to record the District Judge’s order made in his favour and subsequent proceedings. Before the District Judge, the appellant took issue with the following allegations contained within the Web post: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant’s employment had been terminated by the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant had misrepresented to others that he was a Philippines national team coach and/or a Philippines national athlete.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellant had a molest case against him in the Philippines and had molested the athletes he coached. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The appellant’s training methods had caused injuries to the athletes that he coached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On appeal, the aspects of the Web post which the appellant took objection to were those that referred to the appellant as an incompetent coach and a molester who molested the athletes he coached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The basis for the respondent’s assertion that the appellant was a molester was an incident in the Philippines that occurred in April 2006 when a 15 year- old female athlete made a private complaint against the appellant for molesting her. It is undisputed that the complaint was dismissed for lack of probable cause by the Provincial Prosecutor in the Philippines and no further actions were taken against the appellant. The respondent was fully aware that the Philippines Provincial Prosecutor had dismissed the complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Besides the Web post, the appellant claimed that the respondent had behaved in an insulting, abusive and harassing manner towards him during various encounters at the sports stadiums. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The appellant subsequently requested the respondent to remove the Web post but the respondent refused. Consequently, the appellant filed an application under DC/PHA 70060 of 2015 for a protection order pursuant to s 12 of the POHA seeking an order for the respondent to take down the Web post. The appellant also sought a protection order in relation to the alleged physical harassment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The hearing of DC/PHA 70060 of 2015 took place before the District Judge on 16 and 17 November 2015. Before the District Judge, the appellant contended that the Web Post contravened ss 3 and 4 of the POHA and that it was just and equitable to grant a protection order against the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11  The respondent’s contentions were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellant could not avail himself of the remedy under s 12 of the POHA because the POHA was not intended to have retrospective application to the Web post which was made before the POHA came into effect. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With regard to the Web post, the respondent contended that he was telling the truth and that his conduct was reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) With regard to the physical harassment, the respondent denied that the incidents of alleged harassment had occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The District Judge found that the Web post had remained on the JS Athletics website after the POHA came into force and that the appellant could apply for a protection order on the Web post.

This turned on the District Judge’s findings that the Web post contained either true statements or reasonable expressions of the respondent’s personal point of view. Specifically, the District Judge found that the respondent had made acceptable statements pertaining to: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the reasons for his termination of the appellant’s employment in 2009; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the false claims by the appellant to be a Philippines national coach and/or national athlete; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the appellant’s 2006 molest case in the Philippines; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the appellant’s improper training methods causing injuries to his trainees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the premises, the District Judge did not think that it was just and equitable to issue a protection order.

The District Judge found that the appellant had not proved that these incidents had occurred. He further found that the appellant had not shown that he was distressed to such a degree as to justify the grant of a protection order against the respondent.

First, s 13A (and s 3 [of the POHA]), unlike s 13B (and s 4 [of the POHA]) <span class="font-italic">does not require the offence to take place within the hearing or sight of any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.</span> Secondly, a plain reading of s 13B of the MOA reveals that an intention for the conduct to be “threatening, abusive or insulting” is not even a necessary criterion. It has been said that objectivity is the touch stone for assessing the conduct in question and that threats, abuses and insults embraced by s 13B may constitute an offence whether or not they were so intended. <span class="font-italic">This is likely applicable to s 4 of the [POHA].</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As stated by the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, during the Second Reading of the Protection from Harassment Bill, ss 3 and 4 of the POHA were adapted from s 13A and s 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”) with minor changes and modifications so as to extend to words, behaviour or communications made by <span class="font-italic">any means</span> including electronic means as in the present case (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span><span class="font-italic">, Official Report</span> (13 March 2014) vol 91):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clauses 3 to 6 re-enact and update sections 13A to 13D of the MOA respectively, and therefore, sections 13A to 13D of the MOA will be repealed once this Bill goes through. Thus, clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6, which deal with harassment, in fact are taken from the MOA, with some minor changes. The penalties are increased quite substantively. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… First, the Bill makes clear that harassment and related antisocial behaviour are offences, whether committed in the physical world or online; and that must be so.

These illustrations reiterate and signal that the Bill will cover a wide range of anti-social behaviour, such as: cyber bullying; bullying of children; and sexual harassment.

The Web post had remained on the JS Athletics website all along and there had thus been ongoing publication. At the time of the appeal, it remained freely accessible on the Internet. In fact, the respondent had updated the Web post after the hearing before the District Judge and pending the outcome of the present appeal. Accordingly, I agreed with the District Judge that it was open to the appellant to apply for a protection order under s 12 of the POHA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Web post</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I agreed with the appellant that there is essentially a two-stage test to adopt when deciding whether to grant a protection order under s 12 of the POHA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first stage is to establish whether the respondent had contravened ss 3(1) and 4(1) of the POHA by examining the nature of the words or behaviour in question.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the conduct complained of is found to fall within ss 3 or 4, the court then proceeds to the second stage to consider whether any defence can apply.

He did not make it clear if he made any findings in respect of the first stage of the inquiry. But this was not a major source of error, let alone a fatal flaw. Evidently, he had adopted a holistic approach since the words in the Web post could, to some extent, be said to speak for themselves. He examined the reasonableness of the respondent’s conduct to satisfy himself as to whether the words contained any truth or justification such that it could be inferred that there was lack of any malicious intent. It would be needlessly pedantic to fault his reasoning on this score. It sufficed to note that he was conscious that the burden was on the respondent to prove that he could rely on the “reasonable conduct” defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The District Judge accepted that the respondent’s choice of words “may appear harsh” but found that the respondent had reasons for saying so.

Persistent or prolonged conduct that is directed at causing distress in those responsible for discharging their duties would amount to harassment for the purpose of the subject provisions.

The Web post contained serious and unfair allegations of criminal conduct. The words used in the Web post were, in my view, akin to a vulgar tirade mentioned in the illustration to s 4 of the POHA cited above even though no profanities were used. They were cast in highly pejorative terms, clearly calculated to abuse and insult the appellant and vilify him as a recalcitrant sex offender who takes advantage of his trainees by deceptive or manipulative means. The Web post also contained other allegations that the appellant’s training methods were improper or unethical and had “caused” injuries to his trainees. The various allegations were purely accusatory in nature and intended to portray the appellant as a coach who abused the student athletes under his care and adopted improper training methods. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In respect of the accusations of the appellant’s sexual misconduct, it was particularly troubling that the respondent openly acknowledged during cross-examination that the Web post alleging molest was “intended to give the reader the impression that the applicant is guilty of molest” despite being aware that such a complaint had been dismissed by the Provincial Prosecutor in the Philippines:

The molest case, which had been initiated as a private complaint, was dismissed by the Provincial Prosecutor in the Philippines but the respondent chose not to regard this as an important fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Web post contained a link to an article published by the New Paper in April 2011 (“New Paper article”). The New Paper article provided a slightly more balanced account than the respondent’s Web post and does in fact mention the dismissal of the complaint. Nevertheless, the article went on to mention that the victim was not contacted by the relevant prosecuting authorities for follow-up which suggested that her complaint was wrongly dismissed. The District Judge opined that the respondent had provided the link so that readers could draw their own conclusions. The link to this article did suggest an effort towards moderation but the difficulty was that the article itself was pure hearsay, and the respondent’s intent in drawing attention to the article was self-serving: it was to support his own belief and claims that the respondent was at least factually guilty of molest. The article made no mention of anyone having approached the appellant for his side of the story.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 To my mind, the New Paper article would probably lead readers to agree with the respondent. However it cannot be relied upon as evidence of the truth of the matter. It was no different from all the hearsay material that the respondent had amassed from his witnesses to support his allegations of the appellant being an inveterate molester who is a “wolf in a sheep’s skin”. These witnesses included: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ms Amelia Dantis Francisco (RW1) who was a Physical Education Teacher at the University of the East in the Philippines. Ms Francisco testified that the complainant had informed her that the appellant had molested her (the complainant).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ms Mona Liza Evangelista Mendoza (RW2) who was a Physical Education Professor in Bulacan State University in the Philippines and a Coach with the Women’s Athletics Team. Ms Mendoza claimed that the complainant had told her that the appellant had molested her (the complainant). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ms Maria Lydia De Vega Mercado (RW3) who claimed that she had conversations over Facebook with persons who had interacted with the complainant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39  The District Judge ought not to have admitted the respondent’s witnesses’ affidavits in support of the molest allegations. They were of no assistance to the court if all they purported to show was that conversations had taken place between the witnesses and various other persons including the complainant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 More alarmingly, the respondent had propagated half-truths or outright lies to persuade readers to see (and shun) the appellant not only as a liar, fraudster and cheat, but as an incorrigible serial molester. He was adamant on conveying the false impression that the appellant was both factually and legally guilty of molest despite the fact that he has neither been charged nor convicted for any such offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In this connection, the respondent’s claim to have “court documents” to support his allegations was clearly a fabrication. It was not disputed that no charges were preferred in court as the complaint was “dismissed for lack of probable cause”. Curiously, the District Judge considered that the respondent’s reference to the purported “court documents” showed that the respondent had made “genuine and substantial efforts to support the statement he was making”.

</div> With respect, there was no basis for such a finding. It was common ground that the respondent was never prosecuted in any court, hence the idea that there can be any supporting “court documents” was a complete fiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my judgment, the Web post, when read as a whole, was intended to show that the appellant was <span class="font-italic">guilty</span> of molest and was a repeat offender who somehow managed to evade detection and prosecution for other numerous unreported cases. It was therefore clear to me that the respondent’s conduct fell within both ss 3 and 4 of the POHA, having used abusive and insulting words with the intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and these words were seen and perceived by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stage 2: reasonable conduct defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Moving to the second stage of the inquiry, this pertained to whether the respondent had shown that his conduct was reasonable. It must be said that what amounts to reasonable conduct is heavily fact-specific and dependent on the unique circumstances of each case. In responding to questions from the members of the House on the Protection from Harassment Bill, Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam outlined some factors that should be considered when determining the reasonableness of conduct (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span><span class="font-italic">, Official Report</span> (13 March 2014) vol 91):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Reasonableness of conduct is a defence to all of the offences under the Bill and the Court will have to consider, inter alia: <span class="font-italic">the nature of the allegedly offending act in question; the context in which those acts occurred; and the effect of those actions on the victim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I found these factors, namely the nature and context of the offending acts along with their effect on the victim, to be apposite to consider in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 This was not a straightforward case where all the statements were either true and fact-based or all pure fabrication. I agreed with the District Judge’s finding that the Web post was not xenophobic. But it was patently a vituperative post. The respondent’s motive was to “name and shame” the appellant. He was out to disparage and denigrate the appellant, while ostensibly seeking to warn readers about the appellant’s bad character and criminal proclivities. The nature and context of the respondent’s actions clearly showed that they could not be regarded as reasonable conduct by any measure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The District Judge found that in the context of the Web post, having a molest “case” would also mean “complaint” to a reasonable reader.

</div> I respectfully disagreed. Not every reasonable reader would be so discerning as to be able to appreciate a clear and objective distinction between a molest “case”, a “complaint” and a “conviction”, especially when the alleged molest case dates from 2006 and there were strongly-worded allegations of “numerous” other “unreported” cases. It was more likely that most readers would not be able to make such fine distinctions. The respondent must have recognised this, since his boldly undisguised intent was to persuade readers to agree that the appellant was <span class="font-italic">guilty</span> of molest (see [35] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 There were also allegations in the Web post to the effect that the appellant was continually “taking advantage of the situation” when purportedly helping his athletes/clients to stretch.

</div>
</div> The statement in question intimated that the appellant’s “victims” did not know that he was taking advantage of them and touching them inappropriately on the pretext of helping them to stretch. The respondent was plainly not open to other less sinister or more reasonable interpretations. I was unable to see why this should be considered reasonable conduct on his part if all he could really see was his own viewpoint which he was insistent on putting across.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The District Judge came to the conclusion that it was reasonable for the respondent to state that the appellant had a molest case against him in the Philippines. For the reasons mentioned above, this conclusion was against the weight of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the allegations that the appellant’s training methods were improper or unethical and had “caused” injuries, there was no factual basis for these allegations. There could be room for differences in approach and differences of opinion on the effectiveness of various training methods. It would not be reasonable in my view to proclaim that the appellant’s allegedly flawed training methods were the direct cause of injuries to his athletes. With regard to these allegations, I found that the respondent had once again gone too far in his statements. The statements in his Web post reflected the degree of animosity behind his conduct that went beyond mere criticism. In my view, the Web post read as a whole constituted a personal attack on the appellant on all fronts. This was manifestly not reasonable conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I should add that having “reasons” for saying what the respondent said does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that his conduct was “reasonable”. Clearly it could not be so. His posts went well beyond harsh comment or vocal criticism. They were highly derisive. Driven by his personal agenda, he harboured bad blood and was actuated by bad faith. Acting in the name of self-righteous affront or indignation does not automatically equate to acting in good faith. A person who has conducted himself reasonably would not resort to personal attacks on another’s character on his business webpage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I found that the respondent’s conduct was therefore not reasonable even if there may have been some truth in certain assertions he had made. In this regard, I accepted that the respondent’s version of how the appellant left the employment of JS Athletics, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was terminated by the respondent, to be more consistent with the overall probabilities. I also agreed that the appellant had no reasonable basis to lay claim to any involvement with the Philippines national team whether as a coach or athlete. Having said that, his JS Athletics name card carried his purported “national” credentials. This was in all likelihood because the respondent had hastily printed them based on the strength of the appellant’s representations, without going further to verify those claims. It was plausible that the respondent was eager to market his company’s trainers’ credentials which he assumed quite reasonably to be genuine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 With respect to the effect on the appellant, the respondent argued that there was no proven detrimental effect <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no harm, damage or injury to the appellant’s reputation. There was also no apparent serious impact on his employability since he remained gainfully employed. However, this would not preclude protection under the POHA if the elements of s 12 are satisfied, unless the case was clearly <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span> or so minor, frivolous or trifling that it would not warrant the issuance of a protection order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Was the appellant over-reacting or being oversensitive or thin-skinned? I did not think so, given the gravity of what was posted and the context of the posts which were made on a business webpage that was openly accessible to anyone on the Internet. It was sufficient that one would expect the appellant to be distressed, applying the objective standard of a reasonable person. The degree of distress may affect the extent of protection sought and whether it is indeed just and equitable to make the order. This is the inquiry to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether it was just and equitable to grant the protection order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 When the appeal was heard on 11 May 2016, my decision in <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng v Attorney-General and another appeal </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1246 was pending hearing before the Court of Appeal. In the event, the judgment of the majority dealt with the range of relevant factors to be considered when deciding whether it was just and equitable to grant a s 15 POHA order (see <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v T</span><span class="font-italic">ing Choon Meng and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng</span>”)). In this regard, the majority of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng </span>held at [43] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In summary, the following is a non-exhaustive list of factors which the court may consider when confronted with an application under s 15 to decide if it is just and equitable to grant a s 15 order:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the nature of the false statement and the seriousness of the allegation made;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the purpose of the false statement, for example, whether it is said in jest or for the purposes of satire;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the impact of the statement on the subject and the degree of adverse emotional or psychological harm suffered;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the degree to which the false statement has been publicised to the public;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) whether the subject has the means to publicise his or her own version of the truth (and on a channel that is accessible to the readers of the false statement);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) whether the author and/or publisher of the statement has made genuine efforts to point out that the veracity of the statement is not undisputed; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) the ordinary instances of daily living that may be expected to be tolerated by reasonable persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The present case concerned a different remedy under the POHA from what was sought in <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng</span>, which was a s 15 order. Notwithstanding the difference in remedy sought, I found the key considerations which are pertinent to the issue of whether it was just and equitable to grant a s 15 order to be broadly similar to those where a s 12 protection order is sought. In my view, these factors would include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the nature and seriousness of the harassing conduct;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the purpose and motive behind the conduct in question;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the impact of the conduct on the victim and the degree of adverse emotional or psychological harm suffered;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the degree to which the harassing conduct had been made known to the public;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the victim had the means to mitigate or avoid the harassing conduct;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) whether the person behind the conduct had made genuine efforts to ensure that the conduct would not be misconstrued or misunderstood; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the ordinary instances of daily living that may be expected to be tolerated by reasonable persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having considered the factors as applied in the present case, I was satisfied that the necessary threshold was met and that it was just and equitable to make the protection order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Protection order against physical harassment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, I turn finally to the allegations of physical harassment. The appellant must first persuade the court that the harassment had occurred. The difficulty here was that the versions were in conflict. The District Judge made specific findings of fact in respect of the conduct complained of and he found that the degree of distress had not been satisfactorily proved. The appellant also seemed to have abandoned his pursuit of an order on this ground on appeal. He did not mount any challenge to the District Judge’s finding. I therefore deferred to the District Judge’s finding on this aspect and declined to issue a protection order in respect of physical harassment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In summary, the respondent had not succeeded in establishing a defence of reasonable conduct. Although I have noted that there was some truth in certain assertions made by the respondent, I was of the view that the Web post understood as a whole was harassing to the appellant and the respondent should not be permitted to maintain its presence on the Internet. I also found it just and equitable to provide the remedy sought by the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I ordered costs to the appellant here and below fixed at S$12,000 with reasonable disbursements in addition. This comprised the reversal of the costs order of S$8,000 made by the District Judge in favour of the respondent (see [16] above) and the costs of the present appeal fixed at S$4,000 with reasonable disbursements in addition.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">[Afternote] </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 At the time of preparing this grounds of decision, the appellant applied for additional costs to be awarded on account of counsel having overlooked to bring certain matters to my attention in the course of the hearing on 3 March 2017. The respondent registered his objections to the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The appellant’s claims for additional costs mainly relate to the following events:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties’ further written submissions to address <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant’s application to the District Judge for leave to appeal wherein leave was granted and an order was made for costs to be in the cause; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The respondent’s application to the District Judge for security for costs which the appellant claims was dismissed with costs in the cause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I dismiss the application for costs in relation to the parties’ further written submissions addressing <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Meng. </span>The costs incidental to the further submissions had already been factored into my costs order of S$4,000 for the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As for the applications for leave to appeal and security for costs, these were heard together by the District Judge on 23 March 2016 and 4 April 2016 and were scheduled for half-day sessions on each day. Having perused the notes of the District Judge, I observe that the security for costs application was adjourned to 20 April 2016 and that application was eventually withdrawn with <span class="font-italic">no order as to costs</span> (contrary to the appellant’s assertion) because parties had managed to come to an agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the light of the foregoing, I allow the appellant only a further S$800 in costs for the application for leave to appeal since it appears that a substantial portion of the hearings on 23 March 2016 and 4 April 2016 had centred on the security for costs application. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Earnest Lau and Joseph Tham (Chancery Law Corporation) for the appellant;<br/>Ranjit Singh (Francis Khoo &amp; Lim) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
