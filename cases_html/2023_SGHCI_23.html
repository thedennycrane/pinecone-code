In return for the exclusivity, GGK agreed to pay Asiana the same sum, KRW 53.33 billion, as Asiana was due to pay for its share in GGK. In this respect therefore there was a set-off.

In particular, with respect to a transaction that implicates conflict-of-interest, like the transfer of the assets of Asiana Airlines on the condition of procuring funds for the company controlled by Defendant Park Sam-Koo, the value of the relevant assets should be objectively assessed through competitive bidding process or other various assessment methods, and then determine the fair transaction price and terms based thereon without prejudicing the interests of shareholders and creditors, and there exists an occupational duty to ensure that the proceeds and funds from such transaction are properly used for the benefit of Asiana Airlines.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nonetheless, from early January 2016, Defendant Park Sam-Koo instructed Defendant Park Hong-Seok, etc. to commence negotiations as to the Package Deal with the Gate Group. Accordingly, from around January 12, 2016, Defendant Park Hong-Seok met with employees-in-charge of the Gate Group in Singapore to undergo the Package Deal negotiations; in late January of 2016, Defendants Park Hong-Seok and Kim Ho-Gyun went to London and Madrid, etc. to undergo more detailed discussions with the relevant employees of the Gate Group; and in early February 2016, Defendants Park Hong-Seok and Kim Ho-Gyun met with the employees from the Gate Group who visited Seoul and specified the details of the Business Plan (including the agreement on minimum net profit) related to recovering the funds invested in the form of bonds with warrant (hereinafter “BW”) in Kumho Corporation pursuant to the Package Deal via the catering business of Asiana Airlines. <span class="font-underline">Meanwhile, for the purpose of reaching an agreement on the drafted Business Plan, the CEO of Gate Group Xavier Rossinyol visited Seoul around February 15, 2016 and, on the next day (February 16, 2015), Defendant Park Sam-Koo directly met with CEO Rossinyol at the Asiana Town Building located at Osoe-dong, Seoul and the foregoing Business Plan was approved.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thereafter, around August 19, 2016, Defendants Park Sam-Koo and Park Hong-Seok executed the “Agreement regarding Bond with Warrant Subscription” according to which the 30-year exclusive catering business license would be granted to the Gate Group in exchange for its investment in Kumho Corporation. The value of the catering business license was arbitrarily determined at roughly KRW 133.3 billion to match KRW 80 billion that the Gate Group set as domestic facility investment cost (based on the joint venture ratio of 60:40, KRW 80 billion : KRW 53.3 billion, total: KRW 133.3 billion); and, around December 30, 2016, the Defendants transferred the exclusive catering business license at a price considerably lower than the actual value via a private contract to the Gate Group that agreed to fund KRW 160 billion (20 years, 0% interest rate) to Kumho Corporation in the form of acquiring BWs, whereas contractual terms unfavorable to Asiana Airlines were determined such as the agreement that guaranteed minimum net profit for the Gate Group.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Defendants conspired in the above order and breached their duty to have Asiana Airlines transfer the 30-year exclusive catering business license valued at roughly KRW 505 billion (if not reflecting the agreement on guaranteeing net profit, a minimum of KRW 266.9 billion ) to the Gate Group for roughly KRW 133.3 billion, whilst Asiana Airlines would have to pay additional profit for 30 years to the Gate Group pursuant to the “agreement on preservation of minimum net profit” and, in exchange, Kumho Corporation that Defendant Park Sam-Koo controls would reap pecuniary gain corresponding to receiving funds from the Gate Group worth KRW 160 billion at zero (0%) interest rate for 20 years. In so doing, Asiana Airlines incurred pecuniary damages equivalent to the difference between the fair transfer price of the exclusive catering business license and the foregoing transfer price of KRW 133.3 billion.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Chairman Park was tried before the Seoul Central District Court which resulted in a conviction.

As such, safeguarding their autonomy in business operations is paramount, and the collective interests of these business groups should be acknowledged in alignment with their shared objectives. At the same time, there exists an expectation from the public, who have coexisted with these conglomerates for many years, that these entities, as economic actors, uphold the rule of law and fulfill their social responsibilities through transparent corporate governance. In this regard, the use of affiliated companies by large business groups for the benefit of a single individual, their family, or personal entities not only undermines corporate transparency and a healthy work ethos, but also harms the legitimate interests of various stakeholders in the capital market, including minority shareholders and creditors. Moreover, it could have far-reaching effects when liquidity crises or insolvency, caused by self-centered pursuits being transferred to other affiliated companies, ultimately result in irreversible adverse effects on the entire national economy. In light of these considerations, strict control over such practices becomes imperative.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The crime in this case was committed when Defendant Park Sam-Koo, in an attempt to regain control of the Kumho Group, which he had lost in the 2010 workout, developed a so-called “Group Reconstruction Plan (Governance Plan)” with Defendants Yoon Byeong-Chul, Park Hong-Seok, and Kim Ho-Gyun, and others who were or are executives of the strategic management office under the direct control of Defendant Park Sam-Koo, and then conspired with Defendant Yoon Byeong-Chul to embezzle an aggregate of KRW 330 billion in funds from Kumho Group affiliates in the name of Kumho Corporation, which was under Defendant Park Sam-Koo's control […] on the appeal on the set-aside application</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Furthermore, the loss of control over Asiana Airlines and its subsidiaries by Defendant Park Sam-Koo led to a continuous deterioration of Asiana Airlines’ business situation and a severe tarnishing of its corporate image due to these crimes.

First, the jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it; second, where the court decides to grant an injunction restraining proceedings in a foreign court, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed; third, an injunction will only be issued restraining a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court; fourth, since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton </span><span class="font-italic">International Manage</span> <span class="font-italic">(Maldives) Pvt Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>”) at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 This court has also identified five factors (as stated in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [50]) that have to be considered when deciding whether to grant an ASI (see the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">VKC v VJZ and anothe</span><span class="font-italic">r </span>[2021] 2 SLR 753 (“<span class="font-italic">VKC</span>”) at [16]–[20]) and <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>at [66]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) whether the foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiff if allowed to continue;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) whether the ASI would cause any injustice to the defendant by depriving the defendant of legitimate juridical advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) whether the institution of foreign proceedings was or would be in breach of any agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although these factors are to be considered in the round, a breach of an agreement has been regarded as a separate basis on which an ASI may be granted; one that is distinct from vexatious or oppressive conduct (see <span class="font-italic">Sun</span><span class="font-italic"> Travels </span>at [67]).</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For their part, the Applicants accurately summarised the principles in their written submissions:

</div> the Applicants asserted that that the court’s power to grant an anti-suit injunction was the flip side of the coin of the court’s power to stay domestic proceedings under s 6 of the Arbitration Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) and that, accordingly, the court should apply a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> test in order to determine whether there is a valid and binding arbitration agreement which has been breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Counsel for Asiana questioned whether this reasoning was supportable and invited me to consider the question afresh.

This court in <span class="font-italic">Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG </span>[2011] 2 SLR 96 at [24] had also observed that “considerations of comity grow in importance the longer the foreign suit in question has continued, and the more the parties and the foreign court have engaged in its conduct and management”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">83 <span class="font-underline">While the length of delay is relevant, what is of greater importance is</span><span class="font-underline"> the extent to which the delay has allowed foreign proceedings to have progressed</span>: <span class="font-italic">Niagara Maritime SA v Tianjin Iron &amp; Steel Group Company</span> <span class="font-italic">Limited </span>[2011] EWHC 3035 (Comm) at [22], citing Thomas Raphael, <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Anti-Suit Injunction </span>(Oxford University Press, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Raphael</span>”) at para 8.11. Where a foreign judgment has already been delivered as a result of delay, a host of different considerations come into play, and for reasons expounded on below (see [97] and [98]), we are of the view that exceptional circumstances must be shown <span class="font-italic">in addition </span>to the usual requirements for anti-suit relief.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-underline">The second proposition is that delay cannot be justified on</span><span class="font-underline"> the basis that jurisdictional objections are being raised in the foreign court</span>. In <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Angelic Grace </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), it was contended that the proper approach would have been to defer any application for an injunction until “something ha[d] gone wrong”, such as when the foreign court accepted jurisdiction (at 95). Leggatt LJ rejected this approach, and found that this could be patronising and would achieve the “reverse of comity”: “I can think of nothing more patronising than for the English Court to adopt the attitude that if the Italian Court declines jurisdiction, that would meet with the approval of the English Court, whereas if the Italian Court assumed jurisdiction, the English Court would then consider whether at that stage to intervene by injunction. That would be not only invidious but the reverse of comity”. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Cases where proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction have been the subject of a substantive judgment are therefore an extreme case. In cases where proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction have been commenced and have proceeded some way down the road to resolution, whether any delay in seeking anti-suit relief will serve to prevent the granting of such an injunction is a multi-faceted question underlying the exercise of the court’s discretion to grant the injunction sought. Each case will turn on its own facts. In the case of an alleged breach of an arbitration agreement, the exercise of the discretion involves drawing a balance between the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right of a party to an arbitration agreement to insist on its right to enforce that agreement and on the duty on such an applicant to act with due diligence to enforce that right. Not every delay will be fatal—the answer lies in assessing the degree of the delay, what has happened during the period of the delay, the state of the foreign proceedings as a result of the delay and the underlying effect on comity in order to reach a conclusion as to whether the applicant has forfeited its right to compel litigation in the arbitral forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-Contractual Anti-Suit Injunctions - Vexation and Oppression</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the case where the parties to the foreign proceedings are also parties to the arbitration agreement and it is shown that the bringing of the foreign proceedings constitutes a breach of the agreement, then, subject to delay, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> an anti-suit injunction will be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Where the sole defendant in the foreign proceedings is not a party to the arbitration agreement, the question of whether it would be vexatious or oppressive to the defendant if those proceedings were permitted to continue arises.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Lord Scott was considering the possibility of an anti-suit injunction being granted against a non-party to the arbitration agreement but who was alleged in the foreign proceedings to be liable as a joint tortfeasor with a person who was a party. The arbitration clause in that case was of similar scope to that in the CA Arbitration Agreement and the JVA Arbitration Agreement (see [8] above). At [60]–[62] of <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span> Lord Scott said this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60.  There is a point of construction of the exclusive jurisdiction clause that it is convenient to deal with at this point. <span class="font-underline">It is accepted that the clause is not restricted to contractual claims. A claim for damages for, for example, fraudulent misrepresentation inducing an agreement containing an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the same form as that with which this case is concerned would, as a matter of ordinary language, be a claim in tort that arose "out of or in connection with" the agreement.</span> If the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation had been made by two individuals jointly, of whom one was and the other was not a party to the agreement, the claim would still be of the same character, although only the party to the agreement would be entitled to the benefit of the exclusive jurisdiction clause. <span class="font-underline">The commencement of the claim against the two alleged tortfeasors elsewhere than in England would represent a breach of the clause. The defendant tortfeasor who was a party to the agreement would, absent strong reasons to the contrary, be entitled to an injunction restraining the continuance of the foreign proceedings. He would be entitled to an injunction restraining the continuance of the proceedings not only against himself but also against his co-defendant. The exclusive jurisdiction clause is expressed to cover "</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">any dispute</span><span class="font-underline"> which may arise out of or in connection with" the agreement. It is not limited to "any claim against" the party to the agreement.</span> To give the clause that limited construction would very substantially reduce the protection afforded by the clause to the party to the agreement. The non-party, if he remained alone as a defendant in the foreign proceedings, would be entitled to claim from his co-tortfeasor a contribution to any damages awarded. He could join the co-tortfeasor, the party entitled to the protection of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, in third party proceedings for that purpose. The position would be no different if the claim were to be commenced in the foreign court with only the tortfeasor who was not a party to the exclusive jurisdiction clause as a defendant. He would be able, and well advised, to commence third party proceedings against his co-tortfeasor, the party to the exclusive jurisdiction clause.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61. <span class="font-underline">In my opinion, an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the wide terms of that with which this case is concerned is broken if any proceedings within the scope of the clause are commenced in a foreign jurisdiction, whether or not the person entitled to the protection of the clause is joined as defendant to the proceedings. An injunction restraining the continuance of the proceedings would not, of course, be granted unless the party seeking the injunction, being someone entitled to the benefit of the clause, had a sufficient interest in obtaining the injunction. It would, I think, be necessary for him to show that the claim being prosecuted in the foreign jurisdiction was one which, if it succeeded, would involve him in some consequential liability. It would certainly, in my opinion, suffice to show that if the claim succeeded he would incur a liability as a joint tortfeasor to contribute to the damages awarded by the foreign court.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62. This point is of direct relevance in the present case. In the New York proceedings, which I must analyse more fully in a moment, several claims are made but most of them are based upon the allegation that Mr Donohue, Mr Atkins, Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson conspired together fraudulently to extract in various ways substantial sums of money from the Armco group of companies. If the allegations can be made good, the liability of the conspirators would be a joint and several liability. There are substantial issues as to which of the claims fall within the language of the exclusive jurisdiction clause but I think it is clear that some of them do. Of the four alleged conspirators only Mr Donohue and Mr Atkins are contractually entitled to the benefit of the exclusive jurisdiction clause. Mr Atkins has settled with Armco, so it was Mr Donohue alone who commenced an action in this country for an injunction enforcing the clause. <span class="font-underline">If Mr Donohue is entitled to an injunction enforcing the clause he is entitled, in my opinion, to an injunction that bars the continuance of the claims in question not only against himself but also against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson with whom he is jointly and severally liable</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> If claims against Mr Donohue are within the clause, then so too are the corresponding claims against Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson. Mr Rossi and Mr Stinson are not contractually entitled to enforce the clause, but Mr Donohue is, in my opinion, entitled to ask the court to enforce it by restraining the prosecution in New York of all claims within its scope in respect of which Mr Donohue would be jointly and severally liable. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The logic of Lord Scott’s reasoning is, with respect, persuasive.

Ultimately there may be no real conflict between the speech of Lord Scott and the judgment of Laurence Rabinowitz QC because the resolution of the issue turns on the interpretation of the particular contract in the light of the particular facts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I agree that avoidance of forum fragmentation is a relevant consideration underlying Lord Scott’s reasoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang</span> at [81], Quentin Loh J said this about <span class="font-italic">Clearlake</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The English Court in <span class="font-italic">Clearlake Shipping</span> ([64] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) pushed the envelope further by taking into consideration what the court viewed as deliberate and unacceptable forum fragmentation in bringing separate claims in contract and tort in different jurisdictions. I do not need to decide on this point but I will say that it echoes the bold approach of our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> ([30] supra) and can be well justified in some circumstances under the rubric as being required by the ends of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">Andaman</span> at [75] Loh J said this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where substantially the same claims are pursued against related defendants, the ends of justice are, as a general rule, best served by a single composite trial within which all the claims can be determined: see, eg, <span class="font-italic">Donohue v Armco Inc &amp; Others</span> [2002] 1 All ER 749; Halsbury’s at para 75.135; Fentiman at para 16.46.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For my part, I find the reasoning in these citations compelling. In so far as an anti-suit injunction is sought by a party to an arbitration agreement to restrain foreign tort proceedings not only against itself but also against other parties to those proceedings, the position is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The relevant arbitration clause must be interpreted to determine:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether it extends to cover tort disputes as well as contractual disputes; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether it extends to tort claims against non-parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If it does, the court must decide whether bringing the tort claim against the party is a breach of the arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If it is, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the party is entitled to an anti-suit injunction in its favour.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the party has a sufficient interest in the tort claim such as a liability for damages, it is also <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to an anti-suit injunction in its favour to restrain the continuation of the claim as against the non-party.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) If it does not, then it is open to the non-party to seek a non-contractual anti-suit injunction on the basis that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Proper Law of the Arbitration Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was common ground that the doctrines of separability and kompetenz-kompetenz apply both under Singapore and Korean law. Hence the agreement to arbitrate in the various agreements is separate from the main agreement in which it is contained. As a result, the proper law of the arbitration agreement has to be determined separately from that of the main agreement and the arbitration agreement can survive the termination or invalidity of the main agreement. Equally, it is within the power of the arbitral tribunal to determine whether it has jurisdiction to adjudicate over the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Both parties invited me to apply Singapore law to determine the law that governs the arbitration clauses in this case.

In <span class="font-italic">Sulam</span><span class="font-italic">érica, </span>the main agreement was governed by Brazilian law but the arbitration agreement provided for arbitration in London. Under Brazilian law there were fundamental difficulties in enforcing any award which led the Court to conclude that it could not have been the intention of the parties to have Brazilian law govern the arbitration agreement. In <span class="font-italic">BCY v BCZ </span>[2017] 3 SLR 357 the Court emphasised that the governing law of the main contract “should only be displaced if the consequences of choosing it as the governing law of the arbitration agreement would negate the arbitration agreement even though the parties have themselves evinced a clear intention to be bound to arbitrate their disputes” (see also <span class="font-italic">Anupam</span><span class="font-italic"> Mittal</span> at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Public Policy and Arbitrability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anupam</span><span class="font-italic"> Mittal </span>considered the effect of public policy on the ability to arbitrate, drawing, in [46], upon one of its previous decisions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 The relationship between arbitrability and public policy was extensively considered by this court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd</span> and other appeals [2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”) with emphasis on s 11 of the IAA.

We turn now to the question of arbitrability. The absence of arbitrability has come to be associated with that class of disputes which are thought to be incapable of settlement by arbitration. The concept of arbitrability has a reasonably solid core. It covers matters which ‘so pervasively involve “public” rights and concerns, or interests of third parties, which are the subjects of uniquely governmental authority, that agreements to resolve… disputes [over such matters] by “private” arbitration should not be given effect’: Gary Born ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at p 945. However, the outer limits of its sphere of application are less clear. Lord Mustill and Stewart Boyd QC, for instance, suggest that ‘[i]t would be wrong… to draw … any general rule that criminal, admiralty, family or company matters cannot be referred to arbitration’: Michael J Mustill &amp; Stewart C Boyd, The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1999) at pp 149–150.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75.

Asiana did not dispute this as a matter of principle but contended that a dispute based on Article 103 constituted an exception on the basis that the dispute in the Korean CA Proceedings was non-arbitrable under Korean law.

Arbitral proceedings proceed in accordance with agreement between parties and arbitrators or among arbitrators. There is a great deal of difference between litigation and arbitration. In arbitral proceedings, there is no guarantee that an arbitral tribunal would reach the same conclusion about what constitutes Korea's good morals and other social order as a judge would in judicial court. For example, inconsistencies may arise if an arbitral tribunal upholds validity of a juristic act under Article 103 of the Korean Civil Code that would otherwise be, in an objective view, nullified by the same provision. The arbitral tribunal's inconsistent decision then causes a juristic act that is contrary to good morals and other social order to be valid and effective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In paragraphs 36 to 45 he considers the effect a finding under Korean law on the “Arbitrability of a Juristic Act [the CA] Executed through a Breach of trust under the Korean Criminal Code”

As explained above, an arbitrable "private-law dispute" should not simply be construed as an opposite concept of "public-law dispute." Rather, an arbitrable "private-law dispute" is "a dispute whose nature permits parties to agree to resolve it through arbitration under the principle of private autonomy." If a dispute over validity of a contract executed as a by-product of a serious crime like an act of breach of trust is referred to arbitration, an arbitral tribunal consisting of private persons would have to decide the preceding issue of whether there is in fact a crime. Thus, such dispute may not be considered as a typical private-law dispute where parties may freely agree to resolution by arbitration under the principle of private autonomy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45. In light of the above, one may not reach a dispositive conclusion that the dispute in the Korean CA Proceedings is arbitrable under Korean law.

There exists a theory in Korean jurisprudence that when a main contract is null and void because it contravenes good morals and other social order under Article 103 of the Korean Civil Code, validity of an arbitration agreement within the main contract cannot be recognized. According to the theory, that holds true even if the arbitration agreement itself does not present grounds for nullification—a reason being that a valid legal obligation cannot be created from illegality. In my opinion, the theory is sound and persuasive because the purpose of Article 103 of the Korean Civil Code is to preclude the legal order from becoming complicit in illegality by flatly denying and countermanding validity of any juristic act that is contrary to good morals and other social order, and because according such tortious act even partial validity would abolish the entire purpose of Article 103 of the Korean Civil Code.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[footnote omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The paper referred to in support of this theory is an article by Professor Su-mi Kang (“Professor Kang”), Professor of Law at the College of Law of Yonsei University, published in the Journal of Law, entitled “The Validity of Arbitration Agreement in cases where the Validity of the Main Contract is Contested – with particular focus on the Doctrine of Separability”.

In such cases, although there is no ground for invalidation of such arbitration agreement, the validity of the arbitration agreement cannot be accepted because arbitration cannot create a valid legal obligation based on an illegal juristic act. However, this issue is more likely to be discussed in the perspective of arbitrability or public policies rather than separability.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event that one party claims invalidity of a main contract and such claim is not contested by an opposing party, or in the event that one party claims that there are grounds for termination of a main contract and such claim is not contested by an opposing party, or in the event that both parties agree to terminate a main contract, these scenarios could realistically undermine the subject matter of an arbitral award. In that case, an arbitrator can simply acknowledge his or her lack of jurisdiction over the claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, if there is a dispute between the parties regarding the validity of a main contract, an arbitrator's jurisdiction to rule on that of validity could be deemed as a jurisdictional issue. If parties had agreed at the time of entering into an arbitration agreement that an arbitrator would have the power to decide on this issue, then the arbitrator should have the power to decide on validity of the main contract on the basis of this agreement. In the absence of such agreement, the issue must be resolved by contract interpretation. Since the arbitration agreement by its nature has an independent purpose and content separate from the main contract, it is reasonable to assume that disputes over the validity of the main contract also fall within the subject matter of arbitration. To the extent the validity of the main contract is contested, it can be presumed that the arbitration agreement is still valid under the main contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[footnotes omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Professor Lee states that there is no Korean case law either from the Supreme Court or from the lower courts which address this question and expresses his own conclusion in paragraph 52:

Asiana's claim and the dispute in the Korean CA Proceedings come within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the CA. Under Korean law which embraces the principle of separability of an arbitration agreement, the arbitration agreement contained in the CA is not affected by the alleged invalidity of the CA. Thus, Asiana's claim and the dispute in the Korean CA Proceedings which arose out of or in connection with the CA must be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement in the CA unless the court finds the arbitration agreement itself null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. I am of the opinion that there exists no such ground to view the arbitration agreement in the CA null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. Furthermore, the dispute between Asiana and GGK concerns the private law consequence of the CA, a commercial agreement, entered into by Asiana allegedly in breach of trust by its representatives with the alleged involvement of GGK. As such, the dispute squarely falls under the category of typical arbitrable disputes in private law under the Korean Arbitration Act and is capable of being resolved by arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement in the CA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Having confirmed that the principles of separability and kompetenz-kompetenz apply in Korea,

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63. As discussed above, under the separability doctrine embedded in the KAA and accepted by Korean court precedents, the validity of an arbitration clause cannot be denied on the grounds of a challenge to the validity of the main contract. That is unless there are special circumstances to find that the arbitration clause is invalid in itself, the validity of the arbitration clause cannot be denied just because the validity of the main contract is being challenged. Asiana simply asserts that the CA is invalid under Article 103 of the Civil Code, and accordingly the arbitration agreement is also invalid. However, Asiana has not presented a rational argument how an agreement between the parties to resolve disputes by arbitration could be contrary to "good morals and other social order" under Article 103 of the Civil Code. As quoted in the paragraph 54 above, Article 103 of the Civil Code provides that legal acts "<span class="font-italic">which has for its object such matters as are contrary to good morals and other social order shall be null and void</span>." Article 1 of the KAA provides that the purpose of this law is "to ensure the appropriate, fair and prompt settlement of disputes in private law by arbitration". Accordingly, an arbitration agreement whose objective is to resolve the disputes between the parties by arbitration is a means to fulfil such public policy of fair and prompt settlement of disputes in private law expressed in the KAA. Unless there is a special circumstance such as fraudulent inducement to agree to an arbitration or an arbitration clause that is extremely unfair to one party, it is improbable that an arbitration agreement itself would be determined invalid on the ground of Article 103 of Civil Code. I do not find any such circumstance making the arbitration agreement in the CA invalid. Designating Singapore as the place of arbitration is not extremely unfair to Asiana to be viewed as "<span class="font-italic">contrary to good morals and other social order</span>" of Korea. Korean parties commonly agree to arbitrate their disputes in Singapore under the rules of the ICC or SIAC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The question that falls to be answered in his opinion is thus whether the agreement to arbitrate was separate from the question of whether the CA Main Agreement was reached in circumstances that render it contrary to Article 103.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Professor Shin considers the opinion of Professor Kang,

</div> and the kernel of his reasoning in rebuttal is found in the following extract from paragraph 76:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The flaw in the reasoning of Su Mi Kang is the statement that "<span class="font-italic">it cannot create a valid legal obligation through arbitration from an unlawful act</span>". The principle of separability establishes the obligation to arbitrate is not created from the main contract but exists independently. As stated earlier, the principle of separability recognizes that an arbitration agreement, by its nature and function, exists on the premise that disputes may arise over the validity of the main contract containing an arbitration clause. Accepting the opposite argument would invalidate the arbitration agreement whenever the main contract is alleged to be invalid (not just on the grounds of illegality or public policy). Su Mi Kang's opinion is also against the explicit text of Article 17(1) of the KAA, which provides that "<span class="font-italic">an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other clauses of the contract</span>". This provision does not distinguish according to the basis for alleged invalidity. The conclusion is that the principle of separability applies regardless of the basis for pleading invalidity: only if the basis goes to the arbitration agreement specifically will the arbitration agreement be determined invalid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Drawing all this together, the experts are agreed that the principles of separability and kompetenz-kompetenz apply. They are agreed that the invalidity of all or part of the CA Main Agreement will not of itself serve to invalidate the CA Arbitration agreement. They are agreed that a defence based, for example, on fraud/duress (Article 110 of the Korean Civil Code), would not serve to invalidate the CA Arbitration Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This is subject matter which is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> suitable for determination by way of arbitration under the agreement. More specifically, it is not in dispute that the question of whether the CA Main Agreement is void would be susceptible to resolution by way of arbitration if the CA Arbitration Agreement was valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The sole question therefore is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the dispute is non-arbitrable so that the CA Arbitration Agreement cannot be invoked. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It is accepted that the subject matter does not fall within any of the accepted categories of non-arbitrable agreements and that there is no express provision in Korean law which creates an exception to arbitrability when Article 103 is invoked. Further there is no case law which suggests that there is or even might be such an exception when it is accepted that there is no such exception in the case of fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93  The subject matter of the Korean CA Proceedings is, as indicated above, the validity of the CA Main Agreement. The grounds on which it is alleged to be void is that it was entered into in circumstances which are contrary to Article 103 because of the actions of Chairman Park. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94  However, the parties entered into the CA Arbitration Agreement because they wished relevant disputes between them to be resolved by arbitration, not in the courts. The subject matter of the Korean CA Proceedings is a relevant dispute yet it is suggested that a subsequent event, the indictment and conviction of Chairman Park, can, of itself, serve to negate that wish.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my judgment that cannot be the right way to approach the answer to the question. The actions of Chairman Park have been held to constitute a criminal offence. The Applicants played no part in that trial and, in any subsequent civil proceedings, whether in the Korean Courts or in an arbitration, Asiana would have to prove their case – that the CA was entered into in breach of Article 103.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 But the scope of Asiana’s objection cannot be limited to a case where the history subsequent to the making of the agreement presents a potentially strong case that Article 103 might have been breached. If there is a principle that disputes over validity based upon Article 103 are non-arbitrable, it must apply to all cases where Article 103 is invoked. Hence the Tribunal would not have the authority to decide whether it was reasonable to invoke Article 103, far less to decide whether that Article was breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I consider that Professor Shin was correct when he said in paragraph 63 of his report that Asiana has not presented a rational argument as to how an agreement between the parties to resolve disputes by arbitration could be contrary to Article 103. There is no suggestion that the agreement to arbitrate was induced by any conduct that was contrary to “good morals and other social order”. There were rational reasons for agreeing to arbitrate which are not said to be tainted by Chairman Park’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  In my judgment it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between the grounds on which it is said that the subject matter of the CA Main Agreement is void and the grounds on which it is said that the CA Arbitration Agreement is void. It does not follow from the fact that Article 103 is being invoked to invalidate the CA Main Agreement, that the CA Arbitration Agreement is also rendered invalid. In any given case there might be grounds for saying that the CA Arbitration Agreement itself was tainted but that is a far cry from the submission made to me that there was a principle of Korean law that the doctrine of separability does not apply when a main contract is allegedly null and void because it contravenes Article 103.

Case law from the Korean Supreme Court also holds to the same effect: that even in the midst of the arbitral proceedings, a contracting party that claims non-existence or nullity of the arbitration agreement can file an action in court regarding an arbitrable dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">"We proceed on the premise that <span class="font-underline">while arbitral proceedings are ongoing, a party that claims non-existence or nullity of an arbitration agreement can still file an action related to subject matters that fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement in court</span>.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But my point is this. This is something the Korean Courts deal with and allow parties to do. And if I’m doing something which a Korean Court---or if my clients are doing something the Korean Court allows us to do under the law, it cannot be a breach of an arbitration agreement, or at the very least, that would be a strong reason to deny an anti-suit injunction, because we’re just exercising rights and expectations that we have under Korean law in the exact manner that Korean law expects these issues to be decided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Counsel for the Applicants responded by acknowledging that Korean law permitted a party to seek relief in the Korean Courts but contended that this did not mean that Asiana were not in breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement by so doing.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Having regard to the way in which the point was developed, rather than dealing with this as a matter of generality I prefer to restrict my observations to the facts of this case. The pertinent facts are that the Korean CA Proceedings were commenced on 24 January 2022 after the Final Award had been made and the application to set it aside had been commenced in the Singapore Court. It was also made after the Enforcement Proceedings were commenced in the Korean Courts on 20 May 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Article 9 of the KAA contemplates the commencement of proceedings in the Korean Courts either before or in the course of concurrent arbitration proceedings. This is clear from the wording of Article 9(3) and from the approach of the Korean Supreme Court (see [107] above). It does not apply to the facts of this case where the proceedings were commenced after the arbitration proceedings had been concluded and the Final Award had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The purpose underlying Article 9 is to enable a party alleging that an arbitration agreement is void to have that issue determined by the National Court instead of, or as well as, by the Tribunal. It is not to enable a party who did not make that allegation in the arbitration nor seek to raise it before or during the course of the arbitration to do so in the National Court subsequent to the rendering of the Final Award. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the Applicants are correct in their submission that Article 9 does not absolve Asiana from the possibility of being in breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement in starting the Korean CA Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4: If the Court has a discretion to grant the anti-suit injunction, how should it exercise that discretion?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115  On the basis that the commencement of the Korean CA Proceedings was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> a contractual breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement, the correct approach to considering the exercise of discretion is as set out by Steven Chong JA in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span> (see above at [31]). In the case of a contractual breach anti-suit relief will ordinarily be granted unless there are strong reasons not to do so and there is thus no need to adduce additional evidence of unconscionable conduct. But relief must be sought without undue delay and without unconscionable conduct on the applicant’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Here, Asiana assert that the delays that have occurred in the Korean CA Proceedings coupled with the GGK’s manner of conducting those proceedings is such that GGK has lost the right to seek anti-suit relief. GGK seeks to counterbalance the effect of any delay by raising the issue of the alleged unconscionable conduct of Asiana in contesting the arbitration proceedings on the basis that the CA was valid and then, having failed, seeking a determination from a different tribunal that the agreement was void. I do not accept this. The conduct of the party in breach cannot serve to justify delay by the complaining party in seeking anti-suit relief. Indeed, where there is alleged unconscionable behaviour of this nature, this would seem to be a spur to seeking relief promptly; it cannot justify delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 This is therefore a straight question of deciding whether any delay as has occurred in this case is such that the court should refuse to exercise its discretion to grant the injunction sought (see [36] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The procedural timetable for the Korean CA Proceedings is set out in paragraph 42 of Asiana’s written submissions:

Article 3(ii) of KAA defines an arbitration agreement as "<span class="font-italic">an agreement between the parties to settle by arbitration all or some disputes which have already arisen or might arise in the future in respect of defined legal relationships, </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">whether contractual or not</span>."</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">110. Commentators agree that the insertion of the phrase "<span class="font-italic">whether contractual or not</span>" in defining the arbitration agreement in the KAA was to include damages claims based on tort within the scope of an arbitration agreement, as long as the claim is closely related to the relevant contract. Therefore, as long as there exists a valid arbitration agreement, a tort claim arising in connection with the subject contract must be settled by arbitration. (See Exhibit 23, Mok Young Jun &amp; Choi Seung Jae, at p.94).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">112. The scope of the arbitration agreement in the JVA is not confined to contractual disputes.

The Supreme Court has also ruled that if the seller's warranty liability and tort liability rely on the same set of facts, "<span class="font-underline">a dispute regarding whether any tort liability exists is closely related to the performance of the contract, and </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the tort claim fills within the</span><span class="font-italic font-underline"> scope of the arbitration clause</span><span class="font-underline">.</span>" </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Professor Lee agrees that a tort dispute which is closely connected to the contract’s execution, performance and validity can fall within the scope of an arbitration proceeding but contends that existing case law demonstrates a common thread, that this close connection is only present where the tort claim also concerns a breach of contract claim.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Expert Report of Professor Lee Kitaik at para 57 to 61, ABOD Vol VI Tab 10 (1st Affidavit of Kim Minji dated 28 August 2023) at pp 72-73.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Professor Lee goes on to contend that since the tortious act in issue is the Directors’ active participation in the tortious acts of Chairman Park and that none of them were parties to the JVA, any claim against them was non-arbitrable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Whilst it may be that a case where there is not only a tort claim but also a related claim in contract is a prime example of a case which is closely connected for the purposes of arbitrability, I do not understand the Korean Supreme Court in its reasoning set out in paragraph 114 of Professor Shin’s Report to be limiting itself to cases where there was also a contract dispute. It cannot be that by avoiding raising a contract dispute where one was open to the complainant this could avoid the arbitration clause. The language of the Korean Supreme Court echoes that of Article 3(ii) of the KAA which expressly says “whether contractual or not”. The Korean Supreme Court uses the language “but also a dispute directly or closely relating to the formation, performance and validity of the agreement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Furthermore, I am unpersuaded that the fact that a claim in tort is made against individuals who are not parties to the agreement necessarily leads to the conclusion that there can have been no breach of the arbitration agreement. Where a claim in tort is made against both parties and non-parties to the agreement, regard must be had to the substance of the claim and not merely the form. As Lord Scott observed in paragraph 61 of his speech in <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [42] above) the party to the agreement seeking the injunction must show a sufficient interest that an adverse result in the foreign proceedings would materially affect him, such as having a liability in damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As a result, I am satisfied that on its true construction under Korean law the language of the JVA Arbitration Agreement, “[<span class="font-italic">a</span>]<span class="font-italic">ll</span><span class="font-italic"> disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement</span>” [emphasis added] is wide enough to include tort disputes between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 7. The Mozambique judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 This does not however mean that all tort disputes involving the parties to an arbitration agreement will fall to be decided by way of arbitration. It is necessary to identify the nature or substance of the tort dispute and then to consider its relationship to the agreement in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The starting point lies in Article 9(1) of the KAA, cited in [104] above. The relevant passage for present purposes is the underlined words:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A court before which an action is brought <span class="font-underline">in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement</span> shall dismiss the action when the defendant raises as a defense the existence of an arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 How should one go about determining whether any given “matter” is the subject of an arbitration agreement? Beyond directing my attention to the Korean Supreme Court Decision referred to in paragraphs 54 to 56 of Professor Shin’s report to the effect that the dispute in question must relate directly or closely to the formation, performance and validity of the agreement, the experts did not identify any Korean decision or academic paper illustrating how this task was to be addressed under Korean Law.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In paragraph 30 of his expert report, Professor Shin states that in circumstances where there is no direct authority in Korea, the courts will look to case law and commentary from other jurisdictions, particularly from jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Subsequent to the oral hearing in this case, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (“UK”) delivered its Judgment in <span class="font-italic">Republic of Mozambique (acting through its Attorney General) (Appellant) v </span><span class="font-italic">Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL (Holding) and others (Respondents) </span>[2023] UKSC 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 This was a case concerning the interpretation of Section 9 of the UK Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (the “UK Arbitration Act”) which mirrors Article 9(1) of the KAA in that it provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) A party to an arbitration agreement <span class="font-underline">against whom legal proceedings are brought</span> (whether by way of claim or counterclaim) <span class="font-underline">in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration</span> may (upon notice to the other parties to the proceedings) apply to the court in which the proceedings have been brought to stay the proceedings so far as they concern that matter. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 There were agreements between the claimants (“Mozambique”) and the respondents (“Privinvest”) governed by Swiss law relating to borrowings to purchase equipment which were secured by guarantees from Mozambique. These agreements contained conventional arbitration clauses. Mozambique subsequently brought legal proceedings in England alleging that there was a conspiracy involving Privinvest to pay bribes to corrupt officials of Mozambique and others which had resulted in Mozambique being exposed to losses under the guarantees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Privinvest applied to the UK court for a stay under section 9 of the UK Arbitration Act on the basis that the conspiracy claims fell within the arbitration agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The trial Judge dismissed the section 9 applications but this judgment was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal in England. Mozambique then appealed to the Supreme Court which had to decide what the correct approach was to determine whether the “legal proceedings are […] in respect of a matter which under the agreement is to be referred to arbitration” within the meaning of Section 9.  In <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>, Lord Hodge, with whom the other Judges agreed, reviewed the applicable law in many common law jurisdictions, before concluding what the correct approach was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 It will thus be seen that there is a similarity between the issue raised in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span> and that which falls to be decided in this case. Accordingly, once this court became aware of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>, it gave both parties the opportunity to provide further written submissions on the issues raised in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In Section 4(a) of his judgment Lord Hodge addressed the question of “the meaning and ascertainment of a ‘matter’” in section 9 of the UK Arbitration Act. The learned Judge identified (at [48]) that section 9 involved a two-stage process:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 Section 9 involves a two-stage process. First, the court must identify the matter or matters in respect of which the legal proceedings are brought. Secondly, the court must ascertain whether the matter or matters fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement on its true construction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Lord Hodge went on to consider the fact that section 9 gives effect to Article II(3) of the New York Convention (as does Article 9(1) of the KAA) and then considered the jurisprudence developed in relation to legislation in other jurisdictions giving effect to Article II(3) of the New York Convention including the Cayman Islands (<span class="font-italic">Gol </span><span class="font-italic">Linhas Aereas SA v MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners (Cayman) II LP </span>[2022] UKPC 21. <span class="font-italic">FamilyMart</span><span class="font-italic"> China Holding Co Ltd v Ting Chuan (Cayman Islands) Holding Corpn </span>[2023] UKPC 33),  Hong Kong (<span class="font-italic">Quiksilver</span><span class="font-italic"> Greater China Ltd v Quiksilver Glorious Sun JV Ltd and another </span>[2014] 4 HKLRD 759), Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd</span> and other appeals [2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”)), and Australia (<span class="font-italic">WDR Delaware </span><span class="font-italic">Corpn v Hydrox Holdings Pty Ltd </span>[2016] FCA 1164).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 At [61] he cited with approval from the judgment of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>:<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61. Between paras 108 and 122 of the court’s judgment Sundaresh Menon CJ addressed the question whether a “matter” should be interpreted broadly by identifying the essential dispute or the main issue, as Silica urged, or more granularly, as Lionsgate submitted. He stated (para 108) that establishing whether the dispute pertained to a matter that is subject to the arbitration agreement involves the two stages which I have stated in para 48 above: first, the court must identify the matter or matters in respect of which the legal proceedings are brought and then, secondly, the court must ascertain whether the matter or matters fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement on its true construction. At the first stage, the court proceedings which are sought to be stayed may involve more than a single matter. In addressing the differing submissions of the parties, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated (para 113) that the starting point of the analysis was the language of section 6 of the IAA. Section 6 of the IAA mandates a stay only “so far as” the court proceedings relate to the matter or matters which are the subject of the arbitration agreement. This, he stated, militates against taking “an excessively broad view of what constitutes a ‘matter’ or treating it as a synonym for the court proceedings as a whole”. He continued (para 113): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“In our judgment, when the court considers whether any ‘matter’ is covered by an arbitration clause, it should undertake a practical and common-sense enquiry in relation to any reasonably substantial issue that is not merely peripherally or tangentially connected to the dispute in the court proceedings. The court should not characterise the matter(s) in either an overly broad or an unduly narrow and pedantic manner. In <span class="font-italic">most </span>cases, the matter would encompass the claims made in the proceedings. But, that is not an absolute or inflexible rule.” [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Following this review, Lord Hodge expressed his conclusions in [71]–[78]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71. In my view there is now a general international consensus among the leading jurisdictions involved in international arbitration in the common law world which are signatories of the New York Convention on the determination of “matters” which must be referred to arbitration. I summarise my understanding of that consensus in the following paragraphs. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72. First, as I have stated (para 48 above) the court in considering such an application adopts a two-stage process. First, the court must determine what the matters are which the parties have raised or foreseeably will raise in the court proceedings, and, secondly, the court must determine in relation to each such matter whether it falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73. In carrying out this exercise the court must ascertain the substance of the dispute or disputes between the parties. This involves looking at the claimant’s pleadings but not being overly respectful to the formulations in those pleadings which may be aimed at avoiding a reference to arbitration by artificial means. The exercise involves also a consideration of the defences, if any, which may be skeletal as the defendant seeks a reference to arbitration, and the court should also take into account all reasonably foreseeable defences to the claim or part of the claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74. Secondly, while article II(3) of the New York Convention, which requires that the court refer a matter to arbitration, is silent as to the stay of the court proceedings, legislation implementing this provision of the New York Convention has generally made express provision for a stay pro tanto. Section 9 of the 1996 Act has done so expressly. The “matter” therefore need not encompass the whole of the dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75. Thirdly, a “matter” is a substantial issue that is legally relevant to a claim or a defence, or foreseeable defence, in the legal proceedings, and is susceptible to be determined by an arbitrator as a discrete dispute. If the “matter” is not an essential element of the claim or of a relevant defence to that claim, it is not a matter in respect of which the legal proceedings are brought. I agree with the statement of Sundaresh Menon CJ in para 113 of <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>that a “matter” requiring a stay does not extend to an issue that is peripheral or tangential to the subject matter of the legal proceedings. I agree with Foster J’s third proposition in <span class="font-italic">WDR Delaware </span>that a “matter” is something more than a mere issue or question that might fall for decision in the court proceedings or in the arbitral proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76. A focus on the substantial nature and relevance of a referred matter to the legal proceedings is consistent with international jurisprudence, including <span class="font-italic">Lombard North Central</span>, <span class="font-italic">Quiksilver</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ting Chuan</span>. It is also consistent with the Australian jurisprudence in <span class="font-italic">Tanning </span>and <span class="font-italic">WDR Delaware. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77. Fourthly, the exercise involving a judicial evaluation of the substance and relevance of the “matter” entails a question of judgment and the application of common sense rather than a mechanistic exercise. It is not sufficient merely to identify that an issue is capable of constituting a dispute or difference within the scope of an arbitration agreement without carrying out an evaluation of whether the issue is reasonably substantial and whether it is relevant to the outcome of the legal proceedings of which a party seeks a stay whether in whole or in part. In so far as the summary of the law in <span class="font-italic">Sodzawiczny</span>, if read by itself, may suggest otherwise, it is in error. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">78. The existing jurisprudence also supports a fifth point. There may not yet be a consensus on this matter, but common sense lends further support. When turning to the second stage of the analysis (para 48 above), namely whether the matter falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement on its true construction, the court must have regard not only to the true nature of the matter but also to the context in which the matter arises in the legal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 As indicated in [149] above, the courts in Korea look to case law and commentary from other jurisdictions, particularly from jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law in concluding the correct approach to interpreting statutory provisions such as Article 9(1) of the Korean Civil Code in circumstances where there is no specific guidance from decisions or academic commentary in Korea. Lord Hodge’s analysis is detailed and far reaching and I therefore propose to approach the two questions posed by him in the manner suggested in his reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 8. What are “the matter or matters” in respect of which the Korean Compensation Proceedings are brought?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 This is the first of Lord Hodge’s questions and I therefore turn to consider the facts and circumstances underlying the claim in the Korean Compensation Proceedings. First, Asiana submits that the main claim is a claim against the Directors, that this is a legitimate claim because they were the ones involved in the alleged illegal acts and that GGS’s vicarious liability is subsidiary to this.

</div>
</div> Accordingly the claim is about the part played by the Directors in negotiating all the agreements and that the position of GGS as a party to the JVA is immaterial to this question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Counsel for the Applicants submits that although the claim is formulated as being a claim against the Directors with GGS being vicariously liable for their acts, in substance this is a claim primarily against GGS. It is not suggested that either Mr Schmitz or Mr Rossinyol is a man of such substance that he could pay the sums claimed. Their presence as defendants is necessitated by the way in which Korean law is enacted. The objective underlying the claim is to obtain damages from GGS as being vicariously liable for the Directors’ acts. There will be joint and several liability for those acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I consider that the approach of the Applicants constitutes the practical common-sense approach advocated by Lord Hodge. The claim is a claim for damages primarily directed against GGS based on its liability for the alleged tortious acts of the Directors. As indicated in [136] above counsel for Asiana equated these alleged tortious acts to a claim based on conspiracy in Common Law. I find this a helpful analogy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The foundation of the claim lies in the assertion that the way in which the four agreements were structured (the Package Deal) was a conspiracy designed  to prevent Asiana obtaining a fair price for the in-flight catering rights and that the Directors were well aware of this (see [132] above). The dispute thus relates directly to the formation of the Package Deal, particularly the interrelationship between the CA and the BWA, but Asiana contends that this is as far as it goes and that it is nothing to do with the JVA itself.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Counsel for the Applicants submits that this is too narrow a view. Counsel relies upon the fact that the CA was signed on the same day as the JVA by GGK and it was the JVA that established GGK as being the joint venture vehicle, owned 60% by GGS and 40% by Asiana. GGK then entered into the CA.

</div>
</div> The kernel of the dispute is whether in the circumstances this division of ownership represented a fair distribution of the profits. In support of this, they draw attention to the “[m]ethod for calculating the amount of damage suffered by the claimant” in the statement of claim (see [132] above). The principal sum sought from GGS is 60% of the business profit generated by GGK which would in substance equate to the profit which would have been made by GGK over the period of 30 years under the CA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In the light of this the Applicants submit that the substance of Asiana’s claim is to seek to vary the economic benefits which the parties had agreed under the JVA so that Asiana obtains all the profits generated by GGK under the JVA rather than its 40% share subject to a deduction of the investment amount of KRW 80 billion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Whilst the tort proceedings are framed in the pleadings as being a breach of trust akin to a conspiracy, regard must be had to the substance of those proceedings. They are proceedings which seek to address the alleged imbalance of the percentage ownership of GGK as between Asiana and GGS on the basis that the breach of trust was instrumental in creating that imbalance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 It is to be noted that Asiana has not sought to contend that the JVA is void or voidable because of the breach of trust. Article 103 is not relied upon. On the pleadings, if Asiana was wholly successful, it would receive damages to compensate it for the imbalance which on its contention would equate to a significant dilution of the sums that GGS would receive by way of profits in respect of its 60% shareholding.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 GGS’s primary defence to the claim is that the Directors did not actively participate in Chairman Park’s illegal acts (see [132] above) but if this were to fail, there is further defence as to quantum. If there was an imbalance in the shareholding because of the illegal actions, what would have been the fair balance?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Taking all these matters into account, I have concluded that the Korean Compensation proceedings have been brought “to redress by way of damages the loss that Asiana have suffered owing to the alleged imbalance of the shareholdings in GGK due to the Directors’ involvement in the illegal acts of Chairman Park”. There are thus two “matters” which fall to be decided. First, was there a “conspiracy” between the Directors and Chairman Park to create this imbalance? Secondly, if there was, what award of damages would properly serve to redress that imbalance?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 9: Do either of those matters fall within the scope of the JVA Arbitration Agreement on its true construction such that there is a prima facie breach of the JVA warranting an anti-suit injunction in favour of GGS?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 This is a question of Korean law as to the correct interpretation of the JVA Arbitration Agreement (Clause 34.2). The question to be answered is whether the claim, not being a claim concerning the interpretation of the terms of the agreement, <span class="font-italic">relates to a dispute directly or closely relating to the formation, performance or validity of the agreement</span> (see above at [137]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The JVA Arbitration Agreement is in conventional terms.

</div> It goes to the heart of that agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Although <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span> is a decision under English law, the reasoning of Lord Scott at [60] is (see above at [42]), I believe, equally applicable to the interpretation of the JVA Arbitration Agreement under Korean law. The JVA Arbitration Agreement is not restricted to contractual claims. Lord Scott postulated a tort claim for fraudulent misrepresentation inducing the agreement containing the arbitration clause as being the sort of claim in tort which would be held to be a clause that arose “out of or in connection with” the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Here, the material wording of the JVA Arbitration Agreement is the same as was in the clause considered by Lord Scott and his postulated tort is of the same underlying nature as that alleged against the Directors and hence, GGS. Furthermore, GGS has more than sufficient interest in the outcome of the tort proceedings as it will be liable for any damages awarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I consider that the analogy with the facts and reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span> is closer to the factual matrix in this case than are the facts and reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span> and in this case the allegation was that the illegal acts had induced the parties to enter the agreements on the terms which they did. In [106]–[109] of <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>, Lord Hodge explained that the matter identified as arising on the facts of that case was a factual dispute as to quantification which was held to be an insufficient connection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Accordingly, I have concluded that the bringing of the Korean Compensation Proceedings was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> a breach of the JVA Arbitration Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Counsel for Asiana accepted that his clients were not taking a point on delay in relation to the current status of the Korean Compensation Proceedings, such that this would be an inappropriate case for the grant of an anti-suit injunction in favour of GGS to restrain the continuance of the proceedings as against it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 10: Is GGS entitled to an Anti-Suit Injunction to prevent the continuation of the tort claim against the Directors?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I refer back to the factors set out at [50] above. I have found that the JVA Arbitration Agreement on its true interpretation covers the tort claims against GGS. The next question is whether it is wide enough to cover tort claims not only against GGS but also its co-defendants. By parity of reasoning with that of Lord Scott in [60] and [61] in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Donohue </span>(see above [42]) I am satisfied that it does. To reach any other conclusion would be likely to lead to undesirable forum fragmentation. In all the circumstances, this is a clear case whereby the anti-suit injunction granted to GGS to prevent a breach of the JVA Arbitration Agreement should extend to cover the case against the Directors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 11: Are the Directors themselves entitled to an anti-suit injunction?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In the circumstances, it is not necessary that I should address this question. Had the tort action been brought only against the Directors, the analogy with the position of Gunvor in <span class="font-italic">Clearlake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above at [44]) would have been a strong one.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Directors’ Undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I should record that counsel for the Applicants offered an undertaking from the Directors to participate in and be bound by any arbitration between Asiana and GGS commenced in consequence of this anti-suit injunction. It is appropriate that an undertaking of this nature should be given.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 For the reasons given, GGK is entitled to an anti-suit injunction to restrain Asiana from proceeding further with the Korean CA Proceedings and GGS is entitled to a similar injunction restraining Asiana from proceeding further with the Korean Compensation Proceedings both against it and against the Directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 The parties should seek to agree:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The wording of the injunction;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The wording of the Directors’ undertaking; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In so far as this cannot be done, the parties should within 21 days of this judgment file written submissions on the matters in dispute (limited to 5 pages) and indicate whether they are prepared to dispense with an oral hearing on those matters. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><br/>Simon Thorley KC <br/>International Judge</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Wey-Ren Colin (Instructed), Kok Chee Yong Jared, Jodi Siah Be Koen (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the applicants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Chua Han Yuan Kenneth (Cai Han Yuan), Tan Shi Ying, Crystal (TSMP Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

It is a joint venture between the 2nd Applicant, Gate Gourmet Switzerland GMBH (“GGS”) and Asiana. GGK’s main customer is Asiana.  GGS is a Swiss company which provides in-flight catering and other airline handling services.  GGS and GGK are part of the Gate Gourmet group of companies of which the 3rd and 4th Applicants, Mr Christoph Schmitz (“Mr Schmitz”) and Mr Xavier Rossinyol Espel (“Mr Rossinyol”) (collectively, “the Directors”), are, respectively, the current and former Chief Executive Officers. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3. The four agreements that form the subject of the dispute are: </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. a Joint Venture Agreement between GGS and Asiana (the “JVA”);</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. a Catering Agreement between GGK and Asiana (the “CA”);</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. a Bonds with Warrants Subscription Agreement between Gategroup Financial Services SarL and Kumho &amp; Company Inc (GGS’s and Asiana’s respective affiliate companies); and</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. a Management Services Agreement between GGS and GGK.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4. The agreements were negotiated on behalf of the Kumho Asiana Group by, amongst others, Mr Park Sam-Koo (“Chairman Park”) who was at the time Chairman of the Kumho Asiana Group and co-CEO of Asiana. He also held key positions in other companies of the group and was a significant shareholder in the Kumho Asiana Group.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5. Both the JVA and the CA contained arbitration agreements (respectively, the “CA Arbitration Agreement” and the “JVA Arbitration Agreement”) in substantially the same form.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6. A dispute arose between the parties concerning the pricing mechanism for catering services that GGK was to provide to Asiana and the matter was referred to arbitration on 17 June 2019 by GGK, who sought an order that Asiana pay all outstanding invoices and a declaration that the pricing mechanism was binding and did not require any further agreement. Asiana counterclaimed for a declaration that GGK was bound to negotiate and agree with Asiana on an adjusted price mechanism and for an order that GGK repay excess payments based on that adjusted price mechanism.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7. By its award dated 18 February 2021 (“the Final Award”), the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) upheld GGKs’ claims and dismissed Asiana’s counterclaim. On 11 June 2021, Asiana commenced SIC/OS 11/2021 (“OS 11”) in the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) to set aside the Final Award. OS 11 was dismissed by a Judgment dated 27 May 2022 (<span class="font-italic">Asiana Airlines, Inc v Gate Gourmet Korea Co, Ltd and others </span>[2022] SGHC(I) 8) and the subsequent appeal from OS 11 to the Court of Appeal (CA/CAS 5/2022) was dismissed on 14 November 2022.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8. Following the Tribunal’s Award, on 20 May 2021 GGK commenced proceedings in the Seoul Southern District Court seeking leave to enforce the Final Award in Korea. These proceedings were suspended pending the final outcome of the challenges to the Final Award in the Singapore courts. No date has been fixed for a further hearing.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9. On 26 May 2021 Chairman Park was indicted by the Korean Public Prosecutor for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes in relation to alleged crimes of embezzlement and breach of trust. Chairman Park was tried before the Seoul Central District Court which resulted in a conviction. In its decision on 17 August 2022 Chairman Park was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10. As a result of the investigations into the conduct of Chairman Park, Asiana commenced two sets of proceedings in the Korean Courts. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11. The first was Case No. 2022 Gahap 51122 brought before the Incheon District Court (“Korean CA Proceedings”) against GGK on 24 January 2022, seeking a declaration that the CA is invalid due to the doctrine of “abuse of power representation” under Article 103 of the Korean Civil Code on the basis that the coupling of the BWA with the CA was a breach of trust by Chairman Park and that GGK actively participated in that breach by entering the CA.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12. The second was Case No. 2022 Gahap 109880 brought before the Seoul Southern District Court (“Korean Compensation Proceedings”) against GGS and the Directors on 13 October 2022, seeking damages on the basis that Chairman Park induced Asiana to enter into a “package deal”, as a consequence of which (i) GGK became Asiana's exclusive airline catering service provider; (ii) Kumho Buslines received at least KWR 160 billion; 69 and (iii) Asiana received inadequate consideration as a result. Asiana claimed that Chairman Park’s action were a breach of trust against Asiana and that GGS, Mr Schmitz and Mr Rossinyol actively participated in Chairman Park's breach of trust by entering into and/or concluding the JVA, for which they are jointly and severally liable pursuant to Arts 35, 756 and 760 of the Korean Civil Code.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13. It is in respect of these two proceedings that the Applicants seek an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">In respect of the Korean CA Proceedings</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14. The SICC decided that the proper law of the CA Arbitration Agreement was Korean law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[62]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[63]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15. The SICC decided that the subject matter of the Korean CA Proceedings was not non-arbitrable under Korean law as Asiana claimed, and that GGK had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[100]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[102]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16. The SICC rejected the argument of Asiana that even if the dispute raised in the Korean CA Proceedings is arbitrable, the bringing of those proceedings nonetheless did not constitute a breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement because Korean law allowed them to be brought pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Korean Arbitration Act 2016. The SICC held that did not absolve Asiana from the possibility of being in breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement in starting the Korean CA Proceedings (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[114]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17. The SICC held that that the conduct of GGK during the relevant period and the delay alleged by Asiana did not disentitle it to the relief it sought to restrain Asiana’s breach of the CA Arbitration Agreement. The SICC therefore granted the anti-suit injunction which GGK sought (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[131]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">In respect of the Korean Compensation Proceedings</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18. The SICC adjudged the true nature of the Korean Compensation Proceedings to be a claim based upon Chairman Park’s alleged breach of trust and a further assertion that because the Directors, and through them GGS, were well aware that Chairman Park’s conduct “was an act of disloyalty” all three have incurred joint and several liability to Asiana under the Korean Civil Code (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[134]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19. The SICC held that the JVA Arbitration Agreement was also governed by Korean law (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[138]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20. The SICC held that on its true construction under Korean law, the language of the JVA Arbitration Agreement is wide enough to include tort disputes between the parties (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[144]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[145]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21. The SICC invited parties to make submissions on the decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in <span class="font-italic">Republic of Mozambique (acting through its Attorney General) (Appellant) v </span><span class="font-italic">Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL (Holding) and others (Respondents) </span>[2023] UKSC 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>”), and after consideration of parties’ positions, adopted the approach in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span> to determine the “matters” in respect of which the Korean Compensation Proceedings were brought (at<span class="font-weight-bold"> [155]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[160]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22. Applying the approach in <span class="font-italic">Mozambique</span>, the SICC found that there were two “matters” which fell to be decided – whether there was a “conspiracy” between the Directors and Chairman Park to create an alleged imbalance of shareholdings <span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">between the  40% shareholding Asiana received in GGK compared with the 60% held by GGS</span> , and secondly, if there was, what award of damages would properly serve to redress that imbalance (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[170]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23. The SICC held that the two matters fell within the scope of the JVA Arbitration Agreement and the bringing of the Korean Compensation proceedings was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a breach of the JVA Arbitration Agreement (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[174]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[177]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24. The SICC concluded that GGS was entitled to the anti-suit injunction it sought to restrain the tort claims both against it and against the Directors, and directed that it would be appropriate for an undertaking to be given by the Directors to participate in and be bound by any arbitration between Asiana and GGS in consequence of this anti-suit injunction (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[179] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[182]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25. The SICC directed parties to agree on the wording of the injunctions, the Director’s undertaking and the question of costs, failing which parties are to file written submissions on the matters in dispute within 21 days of the judgment (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[184]</span>)</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
