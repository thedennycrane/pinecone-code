The 2nd Defendant was not the registered proprietor of the Jalan Dusun Property. Instead, it claimed, via a caveat (the “Caveat”), an interest as purchaser of the same. What was the nature of the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property? And could that interest be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court? After hearing from parties, I allowed the application. These are the grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Plaintiff commenced Suit No 980 of 2016 on 14 September 2016. On 22 March 2019, the High Court gave judgment for the Plaintiff against the 1st to 4th Defendants. The grounds of the Court’s decision are set out in <span class="font-italic">Liew Kum Chong v SVM International Trading Pte Ltd and others</span> [2019] SGHC 163. The extracted judgment, HC/JUD 185/2019, indicated that the 2nd Defendant was to pay the Plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the judgment sum of $100,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum on the judgment sum from the date of writ to the date of judgment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) costs in the sum of $90,000 (to be paid collectively by the 1st to 3rd Defendants); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) disbursements to be fixed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 6 December 2019, the Plaintiff took out SUM 6105. Being originally an <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte </span>application, SUM 6105 came to me as a paper hearing in my capacity as Duty Registrar on 9 December 2019. The orders sought were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The interest of the 2nd Defendant in the [Jalan Dusun Property] be attached and taken in execution to satisfy the Judgment No. HC/JUD 185/2019 dated 22 March 2019 by the Honourable Justice Chua Lee Ming; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.  The 2nd Defendant pay the costs of and occasioned by this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In his supporting affidavit, the Plaintiff claimed that the sum of $228,300.84 remained outstanding from the 2nd Defendant. It was subsequently clarified that this was a typographical error; the correct figure should have been $228,301.44. This figure was arrived at by adding together the following sums: (a) the judgment sum ($100,000); (b) pre-judgment interest (which the Plaintiff quantified at $13,419.92); (c) costs ($90,000); (d) disbursements (which the Court eventually fixed at $16,561.60); and (e) post-judgment interest (which the Plaintiff quantified at $8,319.92 as of the date of the supporting affidavit).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Having some doubt as to whether the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property could be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court, I fixed SUM 6105 for an oral hearing. This was originally scheduled for 9 January 2020, but was rescheduled at the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ request. The first hearing on 28 January 2020 was an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>hearing (as SUM 6105 was filed as an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>application). At this hearing, I indicated to Mr Gavin Neo, who appeared for the Plaintiff, that I was considering fixing SUM 6105 for an <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearing. Mr Neo accepted that the issue of whether the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property could be the subject of an application under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court was quite a novel point. However, he submitted that it was for the 2nd Defendant to apply to set aside any order that was made on SUM 6105, and that it was not for the 2nd Defendant to “block” SUM 6105 at this stage. He also suggested that the 2nd Defendant might seek to sell the Jalan Dusun Property and dissipate the sale proceeds. Alternatively, if the SPA became annulled for the 2nd Defendant’s failure to keep up with the instalment payments, the 2nd Defendant might dissipate any refund paid by LVND. While I appreciated these concerns, I was of the view that the risk of dissipation was somewhat remote. Accordingly, I fixed SUM 6105 for an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing and gave directions for the filing of reply affidavits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9  In broad terms, the Plaintiff’s submissions were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 2nd Defendant owned an equitable interest in the Jalan Dusun Property. Specifically, the 2nd Defendant’s equitable interest in the Jalan Dusun Property had accrued in line with its instalment payments set out in the SPA and, accordingly, the 2nd Defendant held an equitable interest in the Jalan Dusun Property amounting to approximately $750,000.

</div> Further, the 2nd Defendant also had an equitable interest in the paid up instalments of the Jalan Dusun Property should the SPA be annulled: under the SPA, LVND, after making certain deductions, had to refund the balance of the instalments previously paid by the 2nd Defendant if the SPA was annulled.

This flows from the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lysaght</span><span class="font-italic"> v Edwards</span> (1876) 2 Ch D 499 (“<span class="font-italic">Lysaght</span>”), where it was held (at 506) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he moment you have a valid contract for sale the vendor becomes in equity a trustee for the purchaser of the estate sold, and <span class="font-italic">the beneficial ownership passes to the purchaser</span>, the vendor having a right to the purchase-money, a charge or lien on the estate for the security of that purchase-money, and a right to retain possession of the estate until the purchase-money is paid, in the absence of express contract as to the time of delivering possession. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The basis for this is said to be “the confluence of two equitable rules” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee</span> at para 16.84):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… First, a purchaser of land is usually entitled to the equitable remedy of specific performance on the basis that since each piece of land is unique, damages will not be an adequate remedy. Second, the equitable maxim ‘equity looks on that as done which ought to be done’ accelerates in equity that which is inevitable at law so that completion is anticipated in equity. The result is the conversion of the purchaser into the owner of the land in equity, a process which brings about the operation of the doctrine of conversion. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The above passages from<span class="font-italic"> Lysaght</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee </span>appear to imply that a purchaser of land comes to own the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> equitable interest in the land upon the conclusion of a contract for sale. However, in <span class="font-italic">Jerome v Kelly</span><span class="font-italic"> (Inspector of Taxes)</span> [2004] 1 WLR 1409 (“<span class="font-italic">Jerome</span>”), the House of Lords espoused a seemingly more nuanced approach, holding (at [32]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would therefore be wrong to treat an uncompleted contract for the sale of land as equivalent to an immediate, irrevocable declaration of trust (or assignment of beneficial interest) in the land.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The issue of the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of the 2nd Defendant’s equitable interest in the Jalan Dusun Property was an interesting one. Interesting as it was, however, it did not have to be answered at this stage. The High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low LLC v Higgins, Danial Patrick</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>”) makes clear (at [117]–[119]) that in an application under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court, the Court only needs to be satisfied that there is <span class="font-italic">an</span> interest in immovable property that can be attached; issues relating to the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of the judgment debtor’s interest do not arise at this stage. Accordingly, it was sufficient to conclude, in answer to the first issue, that the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property was an equitable interest that arose from a contract of sale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Could the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I now turn to the second issue: could the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court? Having considered the relevant authorities and arguments, I was satisfied that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. It therefore followed that the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property could be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant statutory provisions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20  First, this conclusion is supported by the relevant statutory provisions in the Rules of Court, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) and the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I start with the Rules of Court. In this regard, O 47 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court opens as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Immovable property (O. 47, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1) Where the property to be seized consists of immovable property <span class="font-italic">or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any</span><span class="font-italic"> interest therein</span>, the following provisions shall apply:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The meaning of words “or any interest therein” is plain: O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court covers the seizure of <span class="font-italic">any </span>interest in immovable property. Significantly, there is no limitation placed on the <span class="font-italic">type </span>of such interest. Similarly broad language is also found in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court, which explains how such seizure is effected:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  seizure shall be effected by registering under any written law relating to the immovable property an order of Court in Form 96 (which for the purpose of this Rule and Rule 5 shall be called the order) attaching <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property</span> described therein and, upon registration, such interest shall be deemed to be seized by the Sheriff; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Again, there is no limitation placed on the type of the interest capable of being seized. The wording of O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court therefore suggests that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning to the SCJA, s 13 of the SCJA, in dealing with writs of execution, provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Writs of execution </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">13.</span> A judgment of the High Court for the payment of money to any person or into court may be enforced by a writ, to be called a writ of seizure and sale, under which <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all</span><span class="font-italic"> the property, movable or immovable, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of whatever description</span>, of a judgment debtor may be seized, except —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  the wearing apparel and bedding of the judgment debtor or his family, and the tools and implements of his trade, when the value of such apparel, bedding, tools and implements does not exceed $1,000; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  tools of artisans, and, where the judgment debtor is an agriculturist, his implements of husbandry and such animals and seed-grain or produce as may in the opinion of the court be necessary to enable him to earn his livelihood as such; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  the wages or salary of the judgment debtor; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)  any pension, gratuity or allowance granted by the Government; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)  the share of the judgment debtor in a partnership, as to which the judgment creditor is entitled to proceed to obtain a charge under any provision of any written law relating to partnership. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, the Court noted (at [132]–[133]) that because the Rules of Court provided for different modes of execution, there was no requirement to interpret any particular provision on execution in the Rules of Court as coinciding in scope with the full ambit of s 13 of the SCJA. Notwithstanding this, the Court concluded that the provisions in the Rules of Court on execution by writ of seizure and sale (“WSS”) against immovable property were intended to cover all possible interests in immovable property which came within the ambit of s 13 of the SCJA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, the decisions in <span class="font-italic">American Express Bank Ltd v Abdul Manaff bin Ahmad</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 780 (at [27]) and <span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings Ltd v Straitsworld Advisory Ltd</span> [2017] SGHCR 11 (at [13]–[14] and [30]–[31]) suggest that, because the [Rules of Court] provides for different modes of execution, there is no requirement to interpret any particular provision on execution in the [Rules of Court] as coinciding in scope with the full ambit of s 13 of the SCJA. Thus, since a garnishee order is suitable only for attaching debts, it would not be inconsistent with s 13 of the SCJA to interpret the [Rules of Court] provisions on garnishee orders as not applying to tangible property, even though tangible property is within the scope of s 13 itself. Similarly, since a WSS for immovable property is suitable only for attaching immovable property, it would not be inconsistent with s 13 to interpret the [Rules of Court] provisions on a WSS for immovable property as not applying to chattels, even though chattels fall within the scope of s 13 of the SCJA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This much is uncontroversial, but it begs the further question <span class="font-italic">whether, if the </span><span class="font-italic">[Rules of Court] provides for only one mode of execution against interest in immovable property, there is an expectation that the relevant provision should, in the absence of express indication to the contrary, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cover all types of interests in immovable property coming within the ambit of s 13 of the SCJA</span><span class="font-italic">. In my view, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this is likely to be the case</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Given that the provisions in the [Rules of Court] on execution by WSS against immovable property employ broad and general phrases such as “immovable property or any interest therein” or “interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property” without qualification, <span class="font-italic">the most reasonable interpretation is that they are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">intended to cover all possible interests in immovable property which come within the ambit of s 13 SCJA</span>. This would include the interest of a joint tenant in land. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There can be no doubt that s 13 of the SCJA includes equitable interests. Accordingly, this provision, when read alongside <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, also suggests that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Such an interpretation is also consistent with the LTA. Section 115(1) of the LTA, in dealing with the lodging of caveats, provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Caveats may be lodged</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">115.</span>—(1)  Any person claiming <span class="font-italic">an interest in land</span> (whether or not the land has been brought under the provisions of this Act), or any person otherwise authorised by this Act or any other written law to do so, may lodge with the Registrar a caveat in the approved form which shall include the following particulars:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It has been observed that all equitable interests in land would come within s 115(1) of the LTA (<span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee</span> at para 15.10). What this means is that the reference to “an interest in land” in s 115(1) includes an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale. In my view, there is no reason why the references to the “interest” in immovable property in O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court should not be consistently interpreted, so as to also include an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Two factors in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Peter Low</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, the conclusion at [19] above is also supported by two passages in <span class="font-italic">Pete</span><span class="font-italic">r Low </span>which the Plaintiff relied on. The issue in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span> was whether a judgment for the payment of money could be enforced by way of a WSS against the judgment debtor’s interest in immovable property which was held under a joint tenancy (<span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span> at [10]). Although the Court in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span> was concerned with the attachability of another <span class="font-italic">type</span> of interest in immovable property (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that belonging to a joint tenant), the pronouncements therein are relevant to the present analysis because they shed light on the factors that a Court may look to in determining whether a given type of interest in immovable property can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the interest is capable of being seized by a WSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The first factor is whether the interest in question is even <span class="font-italic">capable</span> of being seized by a WSS. In <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, the Court, in discussing the issue of whether the nature of a joint tenancy meant that a joint tenant’s interest was not exigible to a WSS, held (at [70]–[71]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The key concern arising from the nature of the joint tenancy lies in the oft-cited proposition that all the joint tenants together own the whole property, but no one joint tenant holds any specific or distinct share of the property. This means that every joint tenant must partake in any dealings involving the whole property before such dealings can effectively bind the entire property. Therefore, for instances [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], one joint tenant cannot sell the property without the agreement of all the joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While the foregoing features of a joint tenancy are well established in law, I do not think they necessarily lead to the conclusion that a joint tenant’s interest is incapable of seizure by a WSS, or that a WSS issued against a joint tenant’s interest has nothing to bite onto. <span class="font-italic">First, it is undeniable that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a joint tenant has a real and present interest in the jointly owned property</span><span class="font-italic"> (as opposed to a future, contingent or speculative interest). Secondly, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this interest of a joint tenant’s can be alienated without the consent or participation of the other joint tenant</span><span class="font-italic"> – when he does so, his very act of alienation severs the joint tenancy and crystallises his interest into an aliquot share which can be sold independently of his co-tenant’s interest. Thirdly, it would appear logical that, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whatever interest a judgment debtor is capable of selling on his own, the law of execution of judgments could empower the sheriff to sell it on the judgment debtor’s behalf</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This passage indicates that the question of whether the interest in question is capable of being seized by a WSS is relevant (albeit not conclusive) in determining whether the interest can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. This must be correct. If, at a <span class="font-italic">threshold </span>level, the interest is <span class="font-italic">incapable </span>of being seized by a WSS, then it necessarily follows that it cannot be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court, and the analysis ends there. It is only if the interest is <span class="font-italic">capable</span> of being seized by a WSS that one goes on to consider the <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> question of whether it can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To this end, it seems that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale is capable of being seized by a WSS. The three points highlighted by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, as emphasised in italics and bold italics in the quoted passage at [30] above, apply with equal force to such an interest. In particular, such an interest can be sub-sold pending completion. An equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale is, therefore, to use the language of <span class="font-italic">Peter L</span><span class="font-italic">ow</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a real and present interest that can be alienated without the consent or participation of another, and the law of execution of judgments can empower the Sheriff to sell the interest on the judgment debtor’s behalf. Accordingly, this first factor suggests that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a WSS against the interest confers a real benefit to the judgment creditor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The second factor is whether a WSS against the interest in question confers a real benefit to the judgment creditor. In <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, the Court, in discussing the utility of issuing a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land, held (at [114]–[115]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, while an undivided share in immovable property is difficult to market to third parties and not likely to fetch a good price, that does not mean that the ability to sell an undivided share is without value or utility. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">even if a WSS does not allow the sheriff to sell the land as a whole, it confers a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">real benefit</span><span class="font-italic"> to the judgment creditor in at least two ways</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) It prevents dealings in the land by the other “innocent” joint tenant. This may create enough of a nuisance for the “innocent” joint tenant to: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) settle the debtor-joint tenant’s judgment debt so as to get the WSS lifted; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) buy over the debtor-joint tenant’s share from the sheriff …; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) consent to the sale of the whole property by the sheriff in order that the “innocent” joint tenant may unlock the full economic value of his own aliquot share. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) As purchases of immovable properties in Singapore are generally financed by mortgage loans, a sale under a WSS is not possible without the mortgagees’ consent. In such a situation, the value of a WSS lies not in the judgment creditor’s ability to trigger a sale by the sheriff but in the priority which the WSS affords the judgment creditor in the distribution of any residual proceeds from a mortgagee’s sale. … This advantage concerning priority would also apply in the event that an individual judgment debtor is declared bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For these reasons, I recognise that <span class="font-italic">a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land confers </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">real, and not merely illusory, value </span><span class="font-italic">to a judgment creditor</span>. Whether the economics of litigation in each case warrant the judgement creditor taking the step of seeking such a WSS is a matter for the individual plaintiff and judgment creditor to consider. However, even assuming that there is no power for the court to order a sale of the whole property, it is not necessary to conclude that the court would act in futility by allowing a WSS to attach against a joint tenant’s interest in land. <span class="font-italic">There are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">other ways</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in which the WSS may benefit the judgment creditor</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This passage indicates that in determining whether an interest can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court, it is relevant (but again, not conclusive) to consider whether a WSS against the interest in question confers a real benefit to the judgment creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span>, the Court noted (at [114]) that an undivided share in immovable property was difficult to market to third parties and not likely to fetch a good price. It was in this context that the Court examined the <span class="font-italic">other</span> benefits that might accrue to a judgment creditor who issued a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land. However, these concerns over marketability and profitability do not even arise in the case of an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale. As noted earlier, such an interest can be sub-sold pending completion (see [32] above). A WSS against it confers on a judgment creditor a real benefit that is immediately apparent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the course of oral submissions, Mr Neo highlighted several other benefits that would accrue to the Plaintiff on the specific facts of SUM 6105. I understood these to include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Plaintiff would, apart from having the option of sub-selling the Jalan Dusun Property, also have the option of making instalment payments under the SPA and would, upon completion, become the registered proprietor of the Jalan Dusun Property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the 2nd Defendant would not be able to unilaterally sell the Jalan Dusun Property and dissipate the sale proceeds. This point was elaborated on in the Plaintiff’s written submissions as follows. If an order were made under SUM 6105, the order would be registered under the LTA pursuant to s 132 of the LTA and O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court. Upon such registration, the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property would be deemed to be seized by the Sheriff (O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court) and any dealings by the 2nd Defendant in the Jalan Dusun Property would not be registered unless the registration of the order were cancelled (s 133 of the LTA).

Accordingly, this second factor also suggests that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, the conclusion at [19] above is also supported by policy considerations. Leaving aside the legal technicalities, an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale is, by virtue of its sub-saleability (see [32] above), of clear value to its owner. If such an interest cannot be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court, this would be tantamount to a ring-fencing of the interest from judgment creditors. This, in my view, would be wholly unjust: the owner of the interest would get to enjoy the benefits of ownership, but judgment creditors would not be entitled to the same. This difference in treatment is difficult to justify, and is yet another factor suggesting that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the second issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having regard to the relevant statutory provisions (see [20]–[28] above), the two factors in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low</span> (see [29]–[37] above) and policy considerations (see [38] above), I was satisfied that an equitable interest in immovable property that arises from a contract of sale can be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, and in answer to the second issue, the 2nd Defendant’s interest in the Jalan Dusun Property could be attached under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the circumstances, I granted an order in terms of prayer 1 of SUM 6105.
