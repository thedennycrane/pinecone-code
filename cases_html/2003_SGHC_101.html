<span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 7 March 2003, the Defendant applied by way of Summons-in-Chambers No 1357 of 2003 for depositions to be taken in Malaysia under Order 39 of the Rules of Court from nine named persons and ‘any other witness in Malaysia consented to by the parties to this action’ and for such depositions to be received in evidence at the trial of this action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 8 March 2003, she applied by way of Summons-in-Chambers No 1385 of 2003 for leave to amend her Defence filed on 10 June 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both applications were heard by Assistant Registrar Teo Hsiao Huey on 12 March 2003 and were dismissed, with the Defendant being ordered to pay the Plaintiffs costs of $1,500 and $800 respectively.</span>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The Defendant then filed Registrar’s Appeals No 74 and 75 of 2003 to appeal against the dismissal of her applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 9 April 2003, I dismissed both appeals and ordered the Defendant to pay costs of $4,000 in respect of both appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Defendant now appeals to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of only Registrar’s Appeal No 75 of 2003 relating to the application for amendment of the Defence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The Facts As Pleaded</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> All three parties in this action are Malaysians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In their Statement of Claim filed on 4 January 2002, the Plaintiffs stated that they were married on 8 August 2001 and that the Defendant was a live-in female companion of the First Plaintiff for some 20 years until 11 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In December 1999, the First Plaintiff instructed that a current account be opened with a bank in Singapore in the joint names of the Second Plaintiff and the Defendant with a view to depositing his money there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That was done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Subsequently, a fixed deposit account and a foreign currency account denominated in US dollars were also opened in the joint names of the Second Plaintiff and the Defendant.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The First Plaintiff orally instructed both of them that the money in the accounts was not to be withdrawn without his express authorisation or consent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His intention was for both of them to preserve the money in the accounts for his old age and, upon his death, for both of them to share whatever was left equally. All the money in the three joint accounts came from the First Plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They thus held all the money on implied, resulting or constructive trust for the First Plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> In October 2000, upon the instructions of the First Plaintiff and with the knowledge of the Defendant, the Second Plaintiff transferred $800,000 from the current account to the fixed deposit account. Apart from this, there was no withdrawal from the joint accounts until 11 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> On that date, the Defendant left the First Plaintiff’s home and withdrew or transferred to her personal account or some other unknown account substantial amounts from the joint accounts without the knowledge of the Plaintiffs and without the authorisation or consent of the First Plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> $1,036,000 was withdrawn from the current account leaving a balance of only $1,567.79.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> $810,596.41 was withdrawn from the fixed deposit account and US $372,122.49 was withdrawn from the foreign currency account, leaving both accounts with no money.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The Defendant refused to account to the First Plaintiff in respect of the withdrawn sums of money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly, the Plaintiffs claimed a declaration that the Defendant held the money and all income, proceeds and assets derived therefrom on trust for the First Plaintiff .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They also claimed the return of the money withdrawn from the accounts and asked that an inquiry be held to determine the income, proceeds and assets derived directly or indirectly from it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> In her Defence, the Defendant averred that she met the First Plaintiff in 1975 when she was 20 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She worked as his personal assistant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was and is a partner in a law firm in Kuala Lumpur but had not been in active practice for many years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He used to be a member of the Malaysian Parliament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After his political career ended, he was involved in property and construction business dealings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> Subsequently, the Defendant began cohabiting with the First Plaintiff and his then wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> After that marriage was dissolved, she continued cohabiting with him as husband and wife for about 22 years until her ‘forced departure’ from the home on 11 June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She has commenced proceedings in Malaysia seeking a declaration that she was the wife of the First Plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As she was his wife, she was relying on the doctrine of presumption of advancement from husband to wife.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> In late 1995, the First Plaintiff rekindled his friendship with a senior government official in Malaysia and was thus able to secure various government construction contracts for three large Malaysian companies for which he was paid fees or commissions in excess of RM 40 million, much of which was paid into his law firm’s client’s account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Defendant pleaded that she had directly and/or indirectly contributed to the earning of the fees or commissions.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> In July 2000, the Defendant asked her brother-in-law to manage the funds which the First Plaintiff had agreed to set aside for her or had given to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some of the funds ended up in the Singapore bank accounts in issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The money in those accounts belonged to her solely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She and the Second Defendant had travelled here by air in December 2000 on a day trip for the purpose of opening the joint accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The current account was opened with a cheque for $200,000 drawn by the Defendant’s relative who accompanied them to the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That amount was subsequently repaid to the said relative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The forms for the other joint accounts were signed in Malaysia and sent by the Second Plaintiff to Singapore for processing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The Defendant further averred that arrangements were made for the said fees or commissions received by the First Plaintiff to be deposited into the Singapore bank accounts by her or by the Second Plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Second Plaintiff was involved in the said bank accounts because she was employed in the law firm as the personal manager/accountant and much of the fees or commissions was initially paid into the law firm’s client’s account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the money in the said bank accounts had always been intended for the Defendant alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The purpose of the Second Plaintiff being a joint account holder was to enable the money to be withdrawn by her in the event of the demise of the Defendant without the need for probate action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The bank statements were sent by the bank to the home of the First Plaintiff and the Defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She would check the figures and then send them to the Second Plaintiff for filing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The Defendant admitted leaving the First Plaintiff’s house in the following circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was asked by him to kill one of her brothers with whom the First Plaintiff was having a serious dispute over money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She obviously refused to comply with his demand and was told by him she would have to leave their home for her refusal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Having seen his true colours, she left.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The Defendant averred that she was entitled to withdraw the money in the bank accounts in issue as it belonged to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She was therefore under no obligation to seek the approval of either Plaintiff before doing so.</span></p>

The opinion stated that the proposed amendments to the Defence would raise issues of contravention of the Malaysian Exchange Control Act 1953 and Income Tax Act 1957 and that the arrangement for the transmission of monies into the Singapore bank accounts might be unlawful and therefore void under the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It further stated the Courts in Malaysia would not allow a party to obtain relief premised on an illegality and the Plaintiff in this case would clearly be relying on the illegal arrangement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I allowed the affidavits to be admitted as they did not raise any new point and both parties were prepared to argue the appeal with or without the affidavits.</span></p>

If the facts alleged in the proposed amendment were true, they were surely well within the knowledge of the Defendant who had been so close to the First Plaintiff for years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> She had previously applied unsuccessfully for the case to be tried in Malaysia, one of the grounds being that material witnesses who were nationals and residents of Malaysia would have to be called.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That application was heard by an Assistant Registrar in April 2002 and the appeal therefrom was dismissed in May 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Further, the Defendant’s counsel submitted before me that the Defendant on her own would be able to substantiate the allegations of illegality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That could only mean she was aware of the facts to be adduced in support of the allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-list: Ignore">22.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"><font size="3">             </font></span></span></span> <span lang="EN-GB">The amendments, if allowed, would go far beyond mere clarification of her Defence which was, in essence, an averment that the money in the bank accounts had been given by the First Plaintiff to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the circumstances, to allow the amendment now would be to adjourn the trial of an action commenced in January 2002 to the prejudice of the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any event, the alleged acts of illegality, which the Plaintiffs denied and even if proved, did not have to be relied upon by the Plaintiffs in support of their claim against the Defendant (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">PP v Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc</i> [1999] 1 SLR 803).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore agreed with the Assistant Registrar that leave to amend the Defence should be refused.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The Defendant said it was ironic that the Plaintiffs were applying to amend their Statement of Claim so close to the trial (Summons-in-Chambers No 1695 of 2003 filed on 21 March 2003 and fixed for hearing on 16 April 2003) but were objecting to her amending her pleading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the amendments sought by the Plaintiffs related only to the ‘claim clause’ at the end of the Statement of Claim in that both Plaintiffs, instead of the First Plaintiff only, would be seeking the return of the money in question and the declaration of trust sought would be an additional instead of an alternative prayer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They certainly would not alter or enlarge the claim and would require no consequential amendment on the part of the Defendant.</span></p>
