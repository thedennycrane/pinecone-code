<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the bankruptcy order
                    made by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) on 27 January 2011 in
                    Bankruptcy No 1318 of 2010 (“the Bankruptcy Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mapletree Trustee Pte Ltd (“the
                    respondent”) obtained judgment against Tan Teck Guan (“the
                    appellant”) on 9 December 2009. The appellant made part-payment of
                    the judgment sum, but due to cash flow problems, could not make payment of the
                    balance sum. The respondent therefore commenced bankruptcy proceedings by
                    issuing and serving a Statutory Demand on the appellant on 17 April
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The respondent filed an application for
                    bankruptcy on 5 August 2010 (“bankruptcy application”). In
                    the affidavit filed by one Tam Mei Fong on behalf of the respondent in support
                    of the application (“the Creditor’s Affidavit”), it was
                    asserted that the appellant was not eligible to be considered for the Debt
                    Repayment Scheme (“DRS”) as he had two previous bankruptcy orders
                    made against him in the 5 years preceding the date of the respondent’s
                    bankruptcy application.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, pursuant to Bankruptcy No 2614
                        of 2007 by the petitioning creditor Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation
                        Limited (“OCBC”), the appellant was adjudged bankrupt and a
                        bankruptcy order was made against the appellant on 23 April 2009, with
                        a stay granted till 11 May 2009. The appellant made payment to OCBC on
                        12 May 2009. Although this was one day after the stay had expired, OCBC
                        was itself under the impression that the due date of payment was 12 May
                        2009, and in fact wrote to the court stating that payment was made within
                        the stay period. Accordingly, OCBC’s solicitors filed Summons 3050 of
                        2009 for the bankruptcy order of 23 April 2009 to be
                    annulled.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        pursuant to Bankruptcy No 2401 of 2007 by the petitioning creditor Singa
                        Triumph, the appellant was adjudged a bankrupt and a bankruptcy order was
                        made against the appellant on 29 November 2007, with a stay granted
                        till 13 December 2007. Following the appellant’s payment by the
                        abovementioned date of the stay, Singa Triumph filed Summons 5680 of 2007 on
                        27 December 2007 for the bankruptcy order of 29 November 2007 to
                        be annulled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In reliance on the Creditor’s Affidavit,
                    the AR did not refer the matter to the Official Assignee for assessment of the
                    appellant’s suitability for DRS (“DRS suitability
                    assessment”). Instead, the appellant was adjudged a bankrupt pursuant to
                    the Bankruptcy Order of 27 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is undisputed that the two bankruptcy orders
                    abovementioned had been made against the appellant. However, the appellant
                    emphasised that both orders had already been annulled because full payment had
                    been made in both cases. Although the annulments were disclosed to the court in
                    the bankruptcy application, the effect of the annulled bankruptcy orders on the
                    appellant’s eligibility for the DRS had not been canvassed before the AR,
                    possibly because the appellant was not represented by legal counsel at the
                    hearings on 2 September 2010 and 27 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant therefore filed an application via
                    Summons 776 of 2011, arguing that the Bankruptcy Order should not have been
                    made, and that instead, the appellant should have been referred to the Official
                    Assignee for DRS suitability assessment. The court hearing Summons 776 of 2011
                    took the view that the appellant’s application should be by way of an
                    appeal against the AR’s decision not to refer the appellant for DRS. The
                    appellant accordingly filed the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The sole issue before this court is: whether the
                    existence of a bankruptcy order, which was made and subsequently annulled within
                    the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the bankruptcy
                    application, <em>per se</em> disqualifies the debtor from
                    being referred to the Official Assignee for DRS suitability assessment. In
                    addressing this issue, this court must decide on whether the annulment of a
                    bankruptcy order operates <em>retrospectively</em> or
                        <em>prospectively</em> in the specific situation where
                    the debtor’s eligibility for the DRS is being considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The effect of annulment of a bankruptcy order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The effect of annulment of a bankruptcy order is
                    not provided for in our legislation. There is also no Singapore case law
                    authority on this point. Accordingly, I turn to consider Commonwealth
                    jurisprudence on the effect of such annulment. In so doing, I emphasise that
                    Commonwealth jurisprudence is persuasive given the similarities in the
                    provisions relating to annulment of bankruptcy orders. A comparison of
                    Singapore’s Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy
                    Act”) with the bankruptcy legislation in Malaysia, Hong Kong and
                    Australia suffices to illustrate this point. Section 123(3) of the Bankruptcy
                    Act provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a court annuls a bankruptcy order under this section, any sale or
                        other disposition of property, payment made or other things duly done by or
                        under the authority of the Official Assignee or by the court shall be valid
                        except that the property of the bankrupt shall vest in such person as the
                        court may appoint or, in default of any such appointment, revert to the
                        bankrupt on such terms as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 105(2) of the Malaysia Bankruptcy Act 1967 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an adjudication is annulled under this section, all sales and
                        dispositions of property, and payments duly made, and all acts theretofor
                        done by the Director General of Insolvency, or other person acting under his
                        authority, or by the court, shall be valid, but the property of the debtor
                        who was adjudged bankrupt shall vest in such person as the court appoints,
                        or in default of any such appointment revert to the debtor for all his
                        estate or interest therein on such terms and subject to such conditions, if
                        any, as the court declares by order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 33(4) of the Hong Kong Bankruptcy Ordinance provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the court annuls a bankruptcy order under this section or section
                        20I, any sale or other disposition of property, payment made or other thing
                        duly done by or under the authority of the Official Receiver, a nominee or a
                        trustee or by the court is valid, but if any of the bankrupt's estate is
                        then vested in such a trustee, it shall vest in such person as the court may
                        appoint or, in default of any such appointment, revert to the bankrupt on
                        such terms (if any) as the court may direct, and the court may include in
                        its order such supplemental provisions as may be authorized by the
                        rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 74(6) of the Australian Bankruptcy Act 1966 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a bankruptcy is annulled under this section, all sales and
                        dispositions of property and payments duly made, and all acts done, by the
                        trustee or any person acting under the authority of the trustee or the Court
                        before the annulment shall be deemed to have been validly made or done but,
                        subject to subsection (7), the property of the bankrupt still vested in the
                        trustee vests in such person as the Court appoints or, in default of such an
                        appointment, reverts to the bankrupt for all his or her estate or interest
                        in it, on such terms and subject to such conditions (if any) as the Court
                        orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is evidently substantial similarity in the bankruptcy
                    legislation of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Australia. This is
                    unsurprising, given that the legislative provisions in these jurisdictions were
                    based on the bankruptcy legislation in England.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The weight of Commonwealth case law authority
                    indicates that, as a general proposition, the effect of an annulment of a
                    bankruptcy order is <em>retrospective</em>. In the old
                    English case of <em>Re Keet ex p Official Receiver</em>
                    [1905] 2 KB 666 at 676 (“<em>Re Keet</em>”),
                    the court noted, albeit in <em>obiter</em>, that the effect
                    of an annulment was to “wipe out the bankruptcy altogether, and put the
                    bankrupt in the same position as if there had been no
                    adjudication”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This position was also taken by the Queensland
                    Court of Appeal in the Australian case of <em>Theissbacher v
                        MacGregor Garrick and Co</em> [1993] 2 Qd R 223 (“<em>Theissbacher</em>”), where the majority (Pincus JA and
                    White J) held that a former bankrupt would, upon annulment, be treated in
                    general as never having been made a bankrupt. The same position was reiterated
                    in the cases of <em>Re Wong; ex parte Wong v Donnelly and
                        Others</em> (1995) 131 ALR 180 (Federal Court of Australia)
                        (“<em>Re Wong</em>”), <em>Roberts v Wayne Roberts Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd</em> (2004)
                    208 ALR 532 (Supreme Court of New South Wales) (“<em>Roberts</em>”) and <em>Battenberg v Union
                        Club</em> (2005) 215 ALR 696 (Supreme Court of New South Wales)
                        (“<em>Battenberg</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Both <em>Re Keet</em> and
                        <em>Theissbacher</em> were cited with approval in the
                    recent Malaysian case of <em>Sardar Mohd v Perwira
                        Affin</em> [2010] 4 MLJ 285 at [37] (“<em>Sardar</em>”). As recently as August 2010, the Hong Kong Court
                    of First Instance in <em>Tan Kah Eng v Tan Eng Khiam</em>
                    [2010] 4 HKLRD 526 at [23]
                        (“<em>Tan Kah Eng</em>”) expressed the
                    view that the effect of annulment under Singapore law is that the bankrupt is
                    put in the same position as if there had been no bankruptcy order made against
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I note that in Kala Anandarajah <em>et al, Law and Practice of Bankruptcy in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1999) at p 408, the learned authors
                    cite <em>Re Keet</em> for the proposition that in Singapore
                    and Malaysia:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a]nnulment of a bankruptcy order liberates a bankrupt from the status of
                        bankruptcy as well as the disqualifications of a bankrupt. It wipes out the
                        bankruptcy altogether and puts the bankrupt in the same position as if there
                        had been no bankruptcy order made against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Footnote omitted)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I further note that this is also the view
                    espoused by the Singapore Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office
                    (“IPTO”) in its public circular issued on 31 March 2010
                    (“the IPTO Circular”). Para 5 of the IPTO Circular states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With immediate effect from 1<sup>st</sup> April 2010, IPTO
                        will remove the records of all cases where the bankruptcy order has been
                        annulled from its online information search service This is to recognise
                        that the <em>annulment of a bankruptcy order has the effect
                            in law that the bankruptcy order was never made against the
                            person</em>; and hence there is no issue of public interest in
                        disclosing such information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     While none of the above authorities are
                    binding on me, I see no reason to disagree with them, especially in view of
                    similarities in legislation as noted in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above. Accordingly, I hold that under Singapore law, annulment of a bankruptcy
                    order has the effect of wiping out the bankruptcy altogether and putting the
                    bankrupt in the same position as if there had been no bankruptcy order made
                    against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This does not, however, mean that annulment
                    has retrospective effect for <em>all</em> intents and
                    purposes. In <em>Theissbacher</em>, Pincus JA and White J
                    held that the former bankrupt is “in general” treated as never
                    having been made a bankrupt, such words clearly qualifying their observation
                    that annulment has retrospective effect. More explicitly, in <em>Re Wong</em>, the court cited <em>Theissbacher</em> for the proposition that “an annulment does
                    not avoid the bankruptcy for <em>all</em> purposes”
                    (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Roberts</em> at [46],
                    the court held that “the effect of annulment does not cause <em>all</em> matters to be viewed after the event as if the
                    bankruptcy had never occurred”. Again, in <em>Battenberg</em> at [70], the court noted that the general proposition
                    was “[s]ubject to <em>exceptions</em> which the
                    Bankruptcy Act creates, and <em>exceptions</em> which arise
                    as a matter of the general law” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>Sardar</em>, the
                    Malaysian Federal Court emphasised the words “<em>in
                        general</em>” used by the <em>Theissbacher</em> court (<em>Sardar</em> at
                        [27]), and also took pains to
                    qualify its finding, <em>viz</em> that the effect of the
                    annulment was retrospective, as being applicable to the facts of the specific
                    case before the court (“[f]or this case before me”: see <em>Sardar</em> at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The view that the general proposition does not
                    apply for <em>all</em> intents and purposes is supported by
                    the legislative scheme in Singapore. For instance, pursuant to s 123(3) of
                    the Bankruptcy Act, any sale or disposition of property or payment made under
                    the authority of the Official Assignee <em>prior</em> to
                    the annulment remains valid. Similarly, pursuant to s 147(3) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act, the fact that the bankruptcy order has been annulled does not
                    exempt the bankrupt from being prosecuted for an offence under the Bankruptcy
                    Act committed by the bankrupt during his bankruptcy. Again, pursuant to
                    s 130 of the Bankruptcy Act, where a bankrupt is disqualified from being
                    appointed or acting as a trustee or personal representative in respect of any
                    trust, estate or settlement, the disqualification ceases <em>when
                        the bankruptcy order is annulled</em>, <em>viz</em>, only <em>after</em> the time of
                    annulment. In this regard, I note that in <em>Tan Kah
                        Eng</em>, the court appeared to have considered some of these
                    statutory provisions, and concluded that “annulment operates
                    retrospectively <em>subject to these
                    reservations</em>” (<em>Tan Kah Eng</em> at
                        [17], emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I therefore turn to consider whether a former
                    bankrupt’s eligibility for DRS is an “exception” to the
                    general proposition that annulment is retrospective in nature. This goes towards
                    addressing the issue (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above): if
                    annulment is retrospective for the purposes of ascertaining eligibility for DRS,
                    an annulled bankruptcy order would not disqualify the debtor from being referred
                    for DRS suitability assessment; conversely, if annulment is prospective, the
                    debtor would be so disqualified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does an annulled bankruptcy order disqualify a debtor from being
                referred for DRS suitability assessment?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DRS was instituted as a pre-bankruptcy
                    scheme to assist debtors who have debts less than $100,000 by devising a debt
                    repayment plan to pay their debts over a fixed period of time. Pursuant to
                    s 65(7) of the Bankruptcy Act, if certain qualifying requirements are
                    satisfied, the court “<em>shall</em>”
                    (emphasis added) refer the matter to the Official Assignee for the purpose of
                    enabling the Official Assignee to determine whether the debtor is suitable for
                    the DRS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before a court will refer a debtor to the
                    Official Assignee for DRS suitability assessment, the qualifying criteria in
                    s 65(7) of the Bankruptcy Act must be satisfied. Section 65(7)
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7) If a bankruptcy order may be made on the bankruptcy
                        application, the court shall, instead of making the order, adjourn the
                        bankruptcy application for a period of 6 months or such other period as the
                        court may direct and refer the matter to the Official Assignee for the
                        purpose of enabling the Official Assignee to determine whether the debtor is
                        suitable for a debt repayment scheme under Part VA, if the following
                        qualifying criteria are satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the debt or the aggregate of the debts in respect of which the
                            bankruptcy application is made does not exceed $100,000 or such other
                            amount as the Minister may, by order published in the <em>Gazette</em>, specify;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt, and <em>has not been a bankrupt</em> at any time within the period of
                            5 years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy
                            application is made, under this Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) a voluntary arrangement under Part V in respect of the debtor is
                            not in effect, and was not in effect at any time within the period of 5
                            years immediately preceding the date on which the bankruptcy application
                            is made;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the debtor is not subject to any debt repayment scheme under Part
                            VA, and has not been subject to any such debt repayment scheme at any
                            time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on
                            which the bankruptcy application is made; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) the debtor is not a sole proprietor, a partner of a firm within
                            the meaning of the Partnership Act (Cap. 391) or a partner in a limited
                            liability partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Of particular interest to the present case is
                    s 65(7)(b) (“the s 65(7)(b) requirement”), which
                    stipulates that a debtor would not be referred for DRS suitability assessment
                    if, <em>inter alia</em>, he has been a bankrupt at any time
                    within the period of 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the
                    bankruptcy application is made (“the 5-year period”). The issue
                    before this court is whether a bankruptcy order which has been annulled within
                    the 5-year period (“an annulled bankruptcy order”) disqualifies a
                    debtor from being referred for DRS suitability assessment. No precedent decision
                    on the effect of an annulled bankruptcy order on a debtor’s eligibility
                    for the DRS was cited to me. I will therefore proceed to analyse the position at
                    law through statutory interpretation and first principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The respondent contended that eligibility for
                    DRS <em>is</em> an exception to the general proposition
                    that annulment is retrospective in nature. In other words, a debtor who was the
                    subject of a bankruptcy order subsisting within the 5-year period is
                    disqualified from being referred for DRS notwithstanding that the previous
                    bankruptcy order was subsequently annulled before the present bankruptcy
                    application. To support this contention, the respondent referred to Form 3 of
                    the Bankruptcy Rules, <em>ie</em> the “Affidavit in
                    Support of Creditor’s Bankruptcy Application”. Form 3 requires the
                    creditor to declare to the best of his knowledge and belief that the DRS does
                    not apply to the debtor <em>inter alia</em> because the
                    debtor (Form 3, para 7(c)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">has been <em>adjudged</em> a bankrupt in the 5 years
                        preceding the date of this application</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the respondent, the use of the word
                    “adjudged” suggests that the material consideration is whether or
                    not the debtor has previously been <em>adjudged</em> a
                    bankrupt; <em>viz</em>, any bankruptcy order subsisting
                    within the 5-year period, regardless of whether it has subsequently been
                    annulled, disqualifies the debtor from being referred for DRS suitability
                    assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     However, having regard to the legislative
                    scheme as outlined in the Bankruptcy Act, as well as the legislative purposes
                    motivating the DRS, I do not think that eligibility for the DRS is an exception
                    to the general proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     First, the phrase “has not been a
                    bankrupt” in s 65(7)(b) is equivocal as to whether or not
                    eligibility for the DRS is an exception to the general proposition. This should
                    be contrasted with the unequivocal language of the other
                    “exceptions” contained in ss 123(3), 130 and 147(3) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Second, given the ambiguity of
                    s 65(7)(b), it is necessary to examine legislative intention to discern
                    whether annulled orders are to be considered <em>vis-à-vis</em> eligibility for the DRS. Perusal of the Hansard
                    reveals that the s 65(7)(b) requirement exists because the DRS is not
                    intended to be a scheme that debtors can use repeatedly to avoid paying their
                    debts in full: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (19 January 2009) vol 85 (Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee,
                    Senior Minister of State for Law). I accordingly turn to consider the
                    characteristics of an annulled bankruptcy order, so as to determine whether
                    disqualifying <em>all</em> debtors who had bankruptcy
                    orders annulled within the 5-year period would be in line with the professed
                    legislative intention behind the s 65(7)(b) requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The court’s power to annul a bankruptcy
                    order is set out in s 123(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. The four grounds on
                    which a bankruptcy order may be annulled are set out in sub-sections (a)-(d) of
                    s 123(1), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Court’s power to annul bankruptcy
                            order</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">123. —(1) The court may annul a bankruptcy order
                        if it appears to the court that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) on any ground existing at the time the order was made, the order
                            ought not to have been made;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) to the extent required by the rules, both the debts and the
                            expenses of the bankruptcy have all, since the making of the order,
                            either been paid or secured for to the satisfaction of the court;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) proceedings are pending in Malaysia for the distribution of the
                            bankrupt’s estate and effects amongst the creditors under the
                            bankruptcy law of Malaysia and that the distribution ought to take place
                            there; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) a majority of the creditors in number and value are resident in
                            Malaysia, and that from the situation of the property of the bankrupt or
                            for other causes his estate and effects ought to be distributed among
                            the creditors under the bankruptcy law of Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Simply put, a bankruptcy order may be annulled if (1) the
                    order ought not to have been made in the first place (s 123(1)(a)); or (2) the
                    former bankrupt had paid or secured all the debts and expenses of his bankruptcy
                    (s 123(1)(b)); or (3) proceedings are pending in Malaysia for distribution of
                    the bankrupt’s assets (s 123(1)(c)); or (4) a majority of the creditors
                    are resident in Malaysia and distribution ought to be under the bankruptcy law
                    of Malaysia (s 123(1)(d)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is evident from the four grounds set out
                    above that annulment of a bankruptcy order neither casts any aspersions nor
                    provides any indication <em>vis-à-vis</em> the conduct of
                    the person subject to the bankruptcy order. Accordingly, I conclude that the
                    fact that a debtor had previously been subject to an annulled bankruptcy order
                    should not <em>per se</em> disqualify him from being
                    referred to the Official Assignee for DRS suitability assessment. I do not see
                    any reason in principle why a debtor whose previous bankruptcy order has been
                    annulled should, <em>for this reason alone</em>, be denied
                    an opportunity for his case to be referred to the Official
                Assignee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Practical considerations also support such a
                    conclusion. On or after 1 April 2010, an online IPTO bankruptcy search would not
                    reveal any annulled bankruptcy orders. For practical purposes, therefore,
                    information regarding a debtor’s previous bankruptcy orders (which were
                    subsequently annulled) would <em>not</em> be available to a
                    creditor for the purposes of filing the Creditor’s Petition. Indeed, it
                    bears noting that in the present case, the respondent had been able to obtain
                    information on the appellant’s annulled bankruptcy orders only because it
                    had conducted IPTO bankruptcy searches in November 2009. Such information was
                    relied upon by the respondent in its Creditor’s Affidavit, which was filed
                    in August 2010. Had the respondent conducted fresh bankruptcy searches on or
                    after 1 April 2010 (<em>ie</em> after the IPTO Circular),
                    there would have been no details regarding the appellant’s annulled
                    bankruptcy orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Despite my holding that annulment has
                    retrospective effect and that an annulled bankruptcy order should not be an
                    impediment to a debtor’s eligibility for DRS suitability assessment, I
                    emphasise that this does <em>not</em> mean that the
                    Official Assignee is therefore precluded from considering previous annulled
                    bankruptcy orders in assessing the debtor’s suitability for DRS. It is
                    clear from s 56B(2) of the Bankruptcy Act that, in assessing the
                    debtor’s suitability for DRS, the Official Assignee is not limited to
                    considering the requirements in s 65(7). For instance, pursuant to
                    s 56B(2)(e), the Official Assignee is empowered to find a debtor unsuitable
                    for the DRS “for any other reason”. I further note that the
                    removal of information as indicated in the IPTO Circular is limited to removal
                    from the <em>online</em> information search service; there
                    is no similar removal from the Official Assignee’s own records. Therefore,
                    even though at law the annulment of a bankruptcy order is retrospective for the
                    purposes of determining a debtor’s eligibility to be referred for DRS
                    suitability assessment, the Official Assignee may still consider its own records
                    in determining a debtor’s suitability for DRS. In my tentative view, there
                    may well be cases where, <em>inter alia</em>, a
                    debtor’s pattern of being adjudged bankrupt and subsequently obtaining
                    annulment of the bankruptcy order indicates to the Official Assignee that the
                    debtor is unsuitable for the DRS. However, as this issue is not before me, it is
                    not necessary for me to state any conclusion on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the present case, the respondent declared
                    in the Creditor’s Affidavit that the appellant had previously been subject
                    to bankruptcy orders. Print outs of the online searches annexed to the
                    Creditor’s Affidavit revealed that the bankruptcy orders were subsequently
                    annulled. Respondent’s counsel also apprised the AR of the same at the
                    2 September 2010 hearing. However, the legal point that an annulled
                    bankruptcy order had retrospective effect was not canvassed before the AR,
                    leading the AR to make the Bankruptcy Order of 27 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I therefore set aside the Bankruptcy Order of
                    27 January 2011 and adjourn the bankruptcy application for a further six
                    months from the date of this judgment. I further order that the present matter
                    be referred to the Official Assignee, for the purpose of enabling the Official
                    Assignee to determine whether the appellant is suitable for the DRS. Unless the
                    parties wish to be heard on costs, I would award costs to the appellant to be
                    taxed if not agreed.</p>
