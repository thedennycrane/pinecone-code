The plaintiff’s case was that D1’s liability for the USD 63.3m sum arose from a contract titled “Guarantee”, which was entered into between D1 and D2 on 15 April 2019 (the “Guarantee”). Under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 of the Guarantee, D1 guaranteed the payment of monies by its subsidiaries to D2 for the supply of metal and metal products by D2 to D1’s subsidiaries. Under clause 3.2 of the Guarantee, D1 “irrevocably and unconditionally” provided a “separate and independent” obligation, as “sole or principal debtor”, to pay D2 “on demand” any amounts not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee. The present claim was brought by the plaintiffs instead of D2 because the latter had purportedly assigned its rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did not bring any claims against D2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Central to this application was the plaintiffs’ prayer for a declaration that the Guarantee was an “on demand performance guarantee”. The nature of the Guarantee was a key issue because, under an on demand performance guarantee, the obligor (in this case, D1) is (a) liable as a <span class="font-italic">primary </span>debtor to the obligee (in this case, the plaintiffs), (b) the obligor’s liability is <span class="font-italic">not</span> affected by the validity of the underlying obligation, and (c) the obligor’s liability to pay is triggered upon a simple demand by the obligee. On the other hand, if the Guarantee were a simple guarantee, (a) the guarantor would be liable as a <span class="font-italic">secondary </span>debtor, such that its liability would be contingent upon the principal debtor’s failure to perform its underlying obligation guaranteed by the guarantor, and (b) the guarantor would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be liable if the underlying obligation were void, unenforceable, or ceased to exist. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This was relevant in the present case because D1 did not challenge the validity of the Guarantee. Nor did D1 deny that the USD 63.3m sum was owed by its subsidiaries to D2. Instead, D1’s defence hinged on two securities – referred to as the “GEM Security” and the “Hangji Security” at [10(c)] below – that were <span class="font-italic">not </span>related to the Guarantee or the underlying obligations guaranteed. Rather, these two securities were pledged by D1’s subsidiaries to the plaintiffs under a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> loan agreement. D1’s defence was that the plaintiffs’ improper enforcement of these securities resulted in there being no outstanding sums owed under the Guarantee. Alternatively, D1 submitted that it can set off the two securities against the USD 63.3m sum. The defendants also sought to challenge the assignment of D2’s rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 It was well established that the threshold for striking out is high, and pleadings should not be struck out except in plain and obvious cases (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [18]). When a court is faced with a USD 63.3 million claim and numerous defences raised by the defendants, the instinctive response may be to quickly conclude that the matter was not a “plain and obvious” one for the defences to be struck out. However, there was no general principle that a large claim must necessarily proceed to trial, or that a multi-pronged defence, even if baseless, should not be struck out. When a court is reviewing a striking out application, the court’s duty is not to simply undertake a quantitative exercise to determine if the size of the claim is large or if the number of defences are high. The court’s duty is to review the parties’ cases, even on a summary basis, to determine if the pleadings are so clearly unmeritorious that they raise no triable issue and ought to be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In this case, having reviewed the parties’ pleadings and submissions, I agreed with the plaintiffs that this case was a straightforward claim brought against D1 to claim for liabilities owed under the clear terms of the Guarantee. As the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, the parties’ submissions were only lengthy because the defendants took a blunderbuss approach to their defences. Upon a review of the parties’ pleaded cases, I found that the defendants’ defences were wholly contrary to the plain text of the relevant contracts. Consequently, I struck out the defendants’ defences and granted judgment in the USD 63.3m sum in favour of the plaintiffs against D1. As the defendants have appealed against my decision, I now set out the detailed grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I first set out the relevant parties and key facts. The second plaintiff, Transasia Private Capital Limited (“P2”), is a company incorporated in Hong Kong. P2 is a fund manager that managed Asian Trade Finance Fund 2 (“ATFF2”). P1 is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and is the security agent for P2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 D1 is a company incorporated in Singapore while D2 is a company incorporated in Ontario, Canada. D1 is in the business of trading metals. D1’s subsidiaries that were relevant to this application were UIL Commodities DMCC, UIL Hong Kong Limited (“UIL HK”), and UIL Singapore Pte Ltd (“UIL SG”), and UIL Malaysia Limited (“UIL MY”) (collectively, the “UIL Subsidiaries”). I shall refer to D1 and the UIL Subsidiaries collectively as the “UD Group”. D2 sold metal and metal products to the UIL Subsidiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 D2 was originally named the third plaintiff in Suit 624 by the plaintiffs. After D2 brought an application in HC/SUM 3114/2021 for leave to discontinue or stay Suit 624, an Assistant Registrar granted D2 leave to discontinue the suit as the third plaintiff but required D2 to be the second defendant therein. It was on this basis that D2 filed a defence to the suit to respond to the plaintiffs’ pleadings, even though the plaintiffs did not bring any substantive claim against D2 in the suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 D2’s metal suppliers which were relevant to this application are Triton Metallix Pte Ltd (“Triton”) and API International FZC (“API”) (collectively, the “Metal Suppliers”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Three loans</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 There were three relevant loan arrangements raised by the parties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">ATFF2 Loan between P2 and D2</span>: The first loan arrangement was an uncommitted revolving trade finance facility of up to USD 60 million provided by P2 to D2, which was entered into on 24 May 2019 and set out in a facility agreement (the “Facility Agreement”). The plaintiffs referred to this as the ATFF2-Rutmet Loan in their submissions while D1 referred to it as the ATFF2-Rutmet FA in its submissions. I shall refer to this loan arrangement as the “ATFF2 Loan”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">ATFF1 Loan between D2 and Cantrust (Far East) Limited</span>: The second loan arrangement was raised by D2. This was a facility agreement dated 28 June 2017 and entered into between D2 and Cantrust (Far East) Limited (“Cantrust”), the trustee of the Asian Trade Finance Fund. I shall refer to this loan arrangement as the “ATFF1 Loan”. Cantrust’s rights and obligations under the ATFF1 Loan were subsequently transferred to P2 pursuant to a declaration of trust dated 30 May 2014 between Cantrust and P2.

The reason why D1 provided the Guarantee to D2 was not agreed by the parties. According to D2’s pleaded defence, D1 provided the Guarantee because Export Development Canada (“EDC”), an insurance provider, had initially declined to grant trade credit insurance to UD Group. EDC’s initial refusal to insure the UD Group in turn caused P2 to be unwilling to grant financing to D2 via the ATFF2 Loan. As a result, the parties – P2, the defendants, and EDC – negotiated, and EDC eventually agreed to extend the insurance to the UD Group on two conditions: (a) that UD Group’s principal, Mr Prateek Vijay Gupta, guarantee the Operating Companies’ liabilities to D2 up to a limit of USD 30 million, and (b) that D1 guarantee the Operating Companies’ liabilities to D2. According to D2, it was for this reason that D1 provided the Guarantee to D2, which consequently caused EDC to provide the insurance to the UD Group, and P2 to provide the ATFF2 Loan to D2.

The logic of this defence seemingly flowed in this manner. The value of the Hangji Security was estimated to be approximately USD 42 million, while the value of the GEM Security was estimated to be between USD 38.5 million and USD 65.8 million. It was allegedly agreed between the plaintiffs and D1 that the GEM Security and/or Hangji Security would “ostensibly” be in respect of the UD Loan but that they would also serve as security for the ATFF2 Loan.

This allegedly meant that any assignment must have taken place before any monies could have been drawn down from the facility in order for the assigned security to cover the monies drawn down. As the SD and/or the GSA were both only entered into on 22 November 2019, any security assigned pursuant to either of these documents could only be invoked in relation to monies drawn down on or after 22 November 2019. However, the sums purportedly drawn down by D2 in respect of which the present claim was brought were drawn down between May and July 2019. Accordingly, D1 pleaded that the plaintiffs could not rely on the benefit of the Guarantee <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> those sums. Further in the alternative, even assuming that the SD and GSA were stand-alone documents from the Facility Agreement, D1 pleaded that the Guarantee assigned in these documents could not cover monies drawn down before notices of assignments were given to the Approved Buyers.

This meant that no UIL HK Debt was due and owing, as no such monies had been paid by the plaintiffs to the Metal Suppliers to finance D2’s purchase of metals and/or metal products from the Metal Suppliers that were sold to UIL HK.

Indeed, as the plaintiffs pointed out, courts have routinely determined the question of whether a contract of suretyship is an on demand performance guarantee in interlocutory applications (see, for instance, <span class="font-italic">Master Marine AS v Labroy Offshore Ltd and others </span>[2012] 3 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span>”), where the Singapore Court of Appeal interpreted whether the contract in question was on demand performance guarantee in deciding whether to grant an interim injunction; and <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital LLC v Van Der Merwe and another </span>[2008] 2 All ER (Comm) 1173 (“<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics Group Co Ltd v Emporiki Bank of Greece SA </span>[2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1191 (“<span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics</span>”), and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen Invest AS v Richmond Mercantile Ltd FZC </span>[2016] EWHC 2957 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>”), where the English Court of Appeal (in <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics</span>) and the English High Court (in <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>) respectively considered that the contracts in question were on demand performance guarantees and granted summary judgment). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">O 18 r 19</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I next briefly set out the applicable principles on striking out under O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC 2014, which the parties generally did not dispute.

Under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), pleadings may be struck out if they disclose no reasonable cause of action. A reasonable cause of action is one with some chance of success, when only the allegations in the pleadings are considered: <span class="font-italic">Madan Mohan Singh v Attorney-General</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1085 at [20], citing <span class="font-italic">The “Tokai Maru” </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 646 at [44]. This follows from O 18 r 19(2), which provided that “[n]o evidence shall be admissible on an application under” O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), pleadings may be struck out if they are “scandalous, frivolous or vexatious”. Allegations that are made needlessly and not related to the relief sought may be considered scandalous (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</span> vol I (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Civil </span><span class="font-italic">Procedure</span>”) at para 18/19/11, citing <span class="font-italic">Brooking v Maudslay</span> (1886) 55 L.T. 343). A claim can be “frivolous or vexatious” if it is “plainly or obviously unsustainable”. An action is legally unsustainable if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”. An action is factually unsustainable if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance”, for example, if it is “clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based” (<span class="font-italic">The </span>“<span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5</span>” [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [32]–[33] and [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) contemplates unnecessary pleadings that tend to prejudice, embarrass, or delay the fair trial of the action (<span class="font-italic">Civil Procedure</span> at para 18/19/13, citing <span class="font-italic">Knowles v Roberts</span> (1888) 38 Ch D 263 at 270).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court, pleadings may be struck out if they are an abuse of the court process. This could include: (a) proceedings which involve a deception on the court or constitute a mere sham; (b) proceedings where the process of the court is not being fairly or honestly used, but is employed for some ulterior or improper purpose; or (c) proceedings which are manifestly groundless, are without foundation, or serve no useful purpose (<span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [34] and [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Finally, the following guidance from <span class="font-italic">Bank Negara Malaysia v Mohd Ismail</span> [1992] 1 MLJ 400, endorsed by Judith Prakash J (as Her Honour then was) in <span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko</span> [2015] 1 SLR 325 at [19], is also instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under an O 14 application, the duty of a judge does not end as soon as a fact is asserted by one party, and denied or disputed by the other in an affidavit. <span class="font-italic">Where such assertion, denial or dispute is equivocal, or lacking in precision or is inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the same deponent, or is inherently improbable in itself, then the judge has a duty to reject such assertion or denial, thereby rendering the issue not triable</span>. … [emphasis added in <span class="font-italic">M2B</span>]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 While <span class="font-italic">M2B</span> concerned summary judgment, the general principle espoused in the foregoing extract is equally applicable to a striking out application, as both types of applications concerned interlocutory applications seeking to summarily dispose of a claim. This was especially so in the present case, as the plaintiffs sought to strike out the entirety of the defendants’ defences and to enter judgment against D1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Accordingly, the following issues arose for this court’s determination:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, was the Guarantee an on demand performance guarantee? If so, D1 was liable to the plaintiffs upon a simple demand to pay, and D1’s Hangji and GEM Securities Defence and the Clause 6 Defence would be irrelevant and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the Guarantee was a simple guarantee, was D1’s other defences – namely, the Hangji and GEM Securities Defence and the Clause 6 Defence – liable to be struck out?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, were the defendants’ defences regarding the assignment of D2’s rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs liable to be struck out?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Was the Guarantee an on demand performance guarantee?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I first turn to the issue of whether the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Governing law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 A preliminary issue was the governing law of the Guarantee, as clause 18.1 of the Guarantee provided that the Guarantee was governed by Ontario law. In this regard, it was well established that, where foreign law was not proven or not pleaded, the law of the forum applied by default (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [43]). This is a rule of convenience which the courts may utilise unless it is unjust and inconvenient to do so (<span class="font-italic">D’Oz International Pte Ltd v PSB Corp Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 267 at [25]). There may therefore be situations where the court may refuse to presume that the content of the foreign law is the same as that of the law of the forum in the absence of proof of foreign law. Case law from other jurisdictions has considered the following as possibilities: where it is not in the interest of justice to apply the law of the forum to the issue; where the foreign law is not based on the common law; where it is inherently improbable that the foreign law is the same as the law of the forum; and where fairness requires that the law of the forum should not apply (see the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Balmoral Group Ltd v Borealis (UK) Ltd</span> and others [2006] All ER (D) 378 at [428]). None of these applied to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this case, the plaintiffs submitted that Singapore law applied, as the defendants did not plead or prove Ontario law on any aspect of the Guarantee other than the issue of set-off. The plaintiffs also submitted that, in any event, Singapore law and Ontario law, as another common law jurisdiction, were not materially different on the law of on demand performance guarantees. I agreed with the plaintiffs. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties cited and relied on Singapore law to make submissions on the Guarantee’s nature. As such, I will first turn to consider whether the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee under Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Principles on contractual interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As the determination of the nature of the Guarantee would depend on an interpretation of its terms, it is first appropriate to set out the applicable principles on contractual interpretation in Singapore. In this regard, the following principles are well established (see the Court of Appeal’s summary of the principles in <span class="font-italic">Leiman, Ricardo and another</span><span class="font-italic"> v Noble Resources Ltd and another </span>[2020] 2 SLR 386 at [59]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point is that one looks to the <span class="font-italic">text</span> that the parties have used.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the same time, it is permissible to have regard to the relevant context as long as the relevant contextual points are clear, obvious and known to both parties. The court has regard to the relevant context because it then places itself in “the best possible position to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions by interpreting the expressions used by the parties in the [contract] in their proper context”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The meaning ascribed to the terms of the contract must be one which the <span class="font-italic">expressions</span> used by the parties <span class="font-italic">can reasonably bear</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, to determine the nature of the Guarantee, the <span class="font-italic">text</span> of the Guarantee was paramount. In this regard, the court should not excessively focus on particular phrases or words; the “emphasis is on the document as a whole” (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span> at [41(c)], citing <span class="font-italic">Zurich </span><span class="font-italic">Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Distinction between guarantees, indemnities, and on demand performance guarantees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 With the general principles on contractual interpretation in mind, I now turn to the law pertaining to on demand performance guarantees. An on demand performance guarantee has also been referred to as a “first demand performance bond” (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine </span>at [25]), “first demand performance guarantee” (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span> at [30]), “demand guarantee”, or “first demand guarantee”. For ease of reference, I will adopt the term “on demand performance guarantee” here. One of the earlier and clearer statements on the law of on demand performance guarantees can be found in the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Marubeni Hong Kong</span><span class="font-italic"> and South China Ltd v Mongolian Government </span>[2005] 1 WLR 2497 (“<span class="font-italic">Marubeni</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22] (per Carnwath LJ), citing <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 44-014: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A number of cases have involved discussion of the nature of ‘performance guarantees’ which are, in essence, <span class="font-italic">exceptionally stringent contracts of indemnity</span>. They are <span class="font-italic">contractual undertakings, normally granted by banks, to pay or repay, a specified sum in the event of any default in performance by the principal debtor of some other contract with a third party, the creditor</span>. An unusual feature of several modern cases has been that the bank's <span class="font-italic">liability arises on mere demand by the creditor</span>, notwithstanding that it may appear on the evidence that the principal debtor is not in any way in default, or even that the creditor is in default under the principal contract. Such guarantees are sometimes called ‘first demand guarantees’. It has been held that performance guarantees of this nature are <span class="font-italic">analogous to a bank</span><span class="font-italic">’s letter of credit</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, an on demand performance guarantee is a contractual undertaking by a person, usually a bank, insurer, or similar commercial provider, to pay a specified amount of money to a third party on the occurrence of a stated event, usually the non-fulfilment of a contractual obligation by a principal debtor to that third party (see also the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Vossloh Aktiengesellschaft v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd</span> [2011] 2 All ER (Comm) 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span>”) at [28]; and Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millett, <span class="font-italic">Law of Guarantees</span> (Sweet and Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millett</span>”) at para 1-016). An on demand performance guarantee is akin to letters of credit (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span> at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics </span>at [27], citing <span class="font-italic">Edward Owen Engineering Ltd v Barclays Bank International Ltd</span> [1978] QB 159 at 171; <span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millett</span> at para 16-001). Under a confirmed letter of credit, an issuing bank and a confirming bank are obliged to pay the beneficiary against a complying presentation of documents (see <span class="font-italic">Kuvera Resources Pte Ltd v JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2022] SGHC 213<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Furthermore, an on demand performance guarantee is a “stringent” contract of indemnity (see also <span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [28]; and <span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millett</span> at para 1-016). To that extent, the term “on demand performance guarantee” is a misnomer. Therefore, it was first crucial to understand the difference between a guarantee and an indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Guarantees and indemnities are two types of contracts of suretyship. Under a contract of guarantee (which are also known as “see to it” guarantees (see <span class="font-italic">Master Marine </span>at [29])), which is entered into between a guarantor and a creditor, the guarantor guarantees the performance of the obligation of a third party – the principal debtor – to the creditor. On the other hand, under a contract of indemnity, a party (the obligor) undertakes directly to the beneficiary (the obligee) that the obligor would perform a certain obligation. This indemnity obligation is usually given as security for the performance of an obligation by another party (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh </span>at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is well established that there are two principal differences between a guarantee and an indemnity (see <span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [22] to [26]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Secondary liability</span>: First, a guarantor’s obligation under a guarantee is a <span class="font-italic">secondary </span>one, in the sense that it is contingent upon the principal debtor’s continuing liability and ultimately the principal debtor’s default. The guarantor is not liable unless and until the principal debtor has failed to perform his obligation (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine </span>at [29]). On the other hand, under a contract of indemnity, the liability of the giver of the indemnity is a <span class="font-italic">primary </span>one, and is not dependent upon the principal debtor’s default.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Principle of co-extensiveness</span>: Second, the fact that the guarantor’s obligation is secondary means that, if the underlying obligation is void, unenforceable, or ceases to exist, the guarantor is also discharged from his obligation under the guarantee. This is known as the principle of co-extensiveness, as the guarantor’s liability is “co-extensive” with the principal debtor’s liability. On the other hand, the fact that liability under an indemnity is a primary one means that the principle of co-extensiveness does not apply to a contract of indemnity, and the giver of an indemnity is liable to the creditor even if the underlying obligation between the principal debtor and the creditor is void, unenforceable, or ceases to exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 An example of an indemnity can be found in the case of <span class="font-italic">Clement v Clement</span> [1995] Lexis Citation 4562 (“<span class="font-italic">Clement</span>”). In that case, the son stated in a letter that he would “guarantee” to his parents a company’s payment of retirement benefits. The “guarantee” provided as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">By an agreement of even date (‘the Agreement’) between First Fashions Limited (‘the Company’) and yourselves the Company covenanted to pay certain retirement benefits. <span class="font-italic">Now I undertake that if the Company or its successors fail to pay the sums covenanted to be paid by it I </span><span class="font-italic">or my personal representatives will pay such sums or so much of them as shall not be paid</span>. This guarantee shall continue in force until the death of the survivor of you … For the purposes of this guarantee the liability of the Company shall not be affected by any restriction modification or variation of the sums covenanted to be paid by it … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 While the letter used the phrase “guarantee”, the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Clement </span>held that the promise contained in the letter was in substance an indemnity as it “imposed an obligation independent of the continuation of the Company's liability under the Agreement to pay the Plaintiffs’ pensions if and to the extent that the Company did not do so.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 What, then, was the difference between an on demand performance guarantee and a simple indemnity? The case law and textbooks did not clearly spell this out. Nevertheless, it appeared that one difference was that, under an on demand performance guarantee, liability is triggered upon a simple “demand” by the obligee to pay, usually upon a presentation of one or more documents as stipulated in the contract, without reference to the actual existence of the facts which those documents assert (see <span class="font-italic">Master Marine </span>at [27]; <span class="font-italic">Simic v New South Wales Land and Housing Corp</span> (2016) 339 ALR 200 at [2] per Robert French CJ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Furthermore, under the common law, the English courts have devised evidential presumptions of fact to determine if a document is an on demand performance guarantee or not.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The English Court of Appeal has held in <span class="font-italic">Marubeni</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30] that, in a transaction outside the banking context, the absence of language expressly indicating the creation of an on demand performance guarantee created a strong presumption against the existence of such an obligation (the “<span class="font-italic">Marubeni</span> presumption”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Conversely, English Court of Appeal has also held in <span class="font-italic">Gold Coast Ltd v Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo</span> [2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 617 at [16] (and reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics</span> at [26] to [28]) that the existence of four factors listed in the textbook, <span class="font-italic">Paget’s Law of Banking</span>, gave rise to a presumption that the document in question will be construed as an on demand performance guarantee (“<span class="font-italic">Paget </span>presumption”). These four factors, which I shall refer to collectively as the “<span class="font-italic">Paget </span>factors”, are where the instrument (a) relates to an underlying transaction between the parties in different jurisdictions, (b) is issued by a bank, (c) contains an undertaking to pay “on demand” (with or without the words “first” and/or “written”) and (d) does not contain clauses excluding or limiting the defences available to a guarantor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The parties did not cite to me a Singapore case which has endorsed either the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption or the <span class="font-italic">Paget </span>presumption. I did not need to decide if the <span class="font-italic">Paget </span>presumption applied in this case, as not all the <span class="font-italic">Paget </span>factors were present (since the Guarantee was not issued by a bank). I also did not need to decide if the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption applied in this case – as I will explain in more detail below, even if it did, I would have found that the presumption was rebutted in this case (see [96] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For completeness, it also bears briefly mentioning the “conditional performance bond”, which is contrasted with the “first demand performance bond” or “unconditional performance bond” (which are terms that have been used to refer to an on demand performance guarantee (see [50] above)). A “conditional performance bond” is conditioned on breach and/or actual loss. However, a conditional performance bond is not a guarantee, as the bond issuer’s liability to honour payment on the bond is a primary, rather than secondary, one (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span> at [29]). An on demand performance guarantee may also be drafted in such a way that a demand can be made subject to the fulfilment of various conditions (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span> at [31]), but this does not detract from the <span class="font-italic">primary </span>liability of the obligor of the on demand performance guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Finally, it was also important to note that a contract may not solely be either a guarantee, an indemnity, or an on demand performance guarantee. In the modern commercial world, as highlighted by <span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millet </span>at para 1-015, “[a] more common approach, if the language of the contract permits it, is to treat the contract as giving rise to <span class="font-italic">separate enforceable</span> obligations of indemnity and guarantee” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cases with on demand performance guarantees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 At this juncture, it is helpful to refer to specific examples of contracts that have been held to be on demand performance guarantees. There are four notable cases in this regard, two of which were not in the banking context (so the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption was found to have rebutted in those cases).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The first case of <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>is the most notable case outside the banking context where a contract was held to be an on demand performance guarantee. In that case, Mr and Mrs Van Der Merwe were directors of a company which received financial assistance from the claimant New York entity. Mr and Mrs Van Der Merwe each entered into a document described as a “guarantee” with the claimant. The relevant clauses of the “guarantee” provided as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) by clause 2.1 of the contract, the guarantor (Mr or Mrs Van Der Merwe) agreed “as <span class="font-italic">principal obligor</span> … not merely as surety” that “<span class="font-italic">if … the Guaranteed Moneys are not paid in full on their due date</span> … [the guarantor] will immediately <span class="font-italic">upon demand</span> <span class="font-italic">unconditionally</span> pay to the Lender the Guaranteed Moneys which have not been so paid” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [31]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the guaranteed moneys were defined as “all moneys and liabilities … which are now or may at any time hereafter be due, owing, payable, or <span class="font-italic">expressed to be due, owing or payable</span>, to the Lender from or by the Borrower” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [31]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) clause 4.2 further provided that a “certificate in writing signed by a duly authorised officer … stating <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> amount</span> at any particular time due and payable by the Guarantor … shall, save for manifest error, be <span class="font-italic">conclusive and binding</span> on the Guarantor for the purposes hereof” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Master Teverson gave summary judgment to the claimant. The Van Der Merwes’ appeal to Lewison J was dismissed, and a further appeal to the English Court of Appeal was also dismissed. Waller LJ, in a judgment with whom the other Lord Justices of the English Court of Appeal fully agreed with, held that, while the contract was described as a “guarantee”, “it ultimately depends on the true construction of the agreement whether a particular label is the right one to apply to any instrument” (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>at [7]). Waller LJ emphasised that “context is important”, and “even minor variations in language plus a different context can produce different results” (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [20]). Waller LJ held that the document must be looked at “as a whole”, and “[t]he question at the end of the day is what on the true language of these deeds of guarantee did the Van Der Merwes agree” (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Turning to the text of the contract, Waller LJ first held that the obligation to pay monies (a) “expressed to be due” (b) “upon demand” (c) “unconditionally” (d) as “principal obligor not merely as surety” indicated that the Van Der Merwes “were taking on something more than a secondary obligation” (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [31]). Second, Waller LJ also held that clause 4.2 put “the matter beyond doubt” as, “[a]part from manifest error, the Van Der Merwes ha[d] bound themselves to pay on demand as primary obligor the amount stated in a certificate pursuant to cl 4.2” (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [32]). Therefore, any presumption against the finding of an on demand performance guarantee due to the non-banking context was “clearly rebutted” by the language used in the contract (<span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Bitumen </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I next turn to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>, which is another case outside the banking context. In that case, the claimant, the owner a vessel, entered into a contract titled “Deed of Guarantee” with the defendant, the parent company of the bareboat charterer of the vessel, for the defendant to guarantee the performance of the bareboat charterer’s payment obligations to the claimant. The claimant applied for summary judgment against the defendant in respect of sums alleged to be due under a deed of guarantee. The relevant clauses of the deed provided as follows (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] In consideration of the Owners entering into the Charter with the Charterers and delivering the vessel thereunder, and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which the Guarantor hereby acknowledges) the Guarantor hereby <span class="font-italic">unconditionally and irrevocably</span> guarantees as <span class="font-italic">primary obligor</span> and not merely as surety the due and proper performance of all obligations, including payment obligations, which the Charterers incur or may incur towards the Owners under the Charter (the ‘Guaranteed Obligations’) and to <span class="font-italic">pay to the Owners on demand</span> all monies as may fall due from the Charterers to the Owners and to discharge all Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof when the same become due for payment or discharge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[C] The Guarantor expressly undertakes to make payment <span class="font-italic">on demand</span> of any amount certified by Owners by written notice to be due to the Owners as a consequence of the Charterers not having fulfilled their obligations under the Charter, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written notice for payment from the Owners. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[D] Any payments under this Guarantee shall be made in full, <span class="font-italic">free and clear of any</span><span class="font-italic"> deductions, withholdings, set-offs or counterclaims of any nature whatsoever</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Sir Jeremy Cooke, sitting as a Judge of the English High Court, gave summary judgment to the claimant. Sir Jeremy held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The “key feature of the Deed of Guarantee appear[ed] in paragraph C” of the clause, as the “trigger for payment is the issue of a demand by the Owners for an amount certified by them, by written notice, as due as a consequence of [the principal debtor] failing to fulfil its obligations under the Charter” (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [22]). The “certification of any amount as due as a consequence of non-fulfilment of [the principal debtor’s] obligations must go, inevitably, to liability since, otherwise, the certification of sums as due is meaningless” (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The foregoing point is reinforced by the terms of paragraph D of the clause, which led to the conclusion that “[p]ayments which are certified by the [claimant] as due as a consequence of non-fulfilment of obligations by [the principal debtor] under the Charter fall to be paid, <span class="font-italic">with no defence available of any kind</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The “unconditional and irrevocable wording in the first line of paragraph A [did] not really take the matter any further save to emphasise the nature of the obligation undertaken”, but, “looking at the clause as a whole, there can … be no doubt as to the objective intention of the parties which was that, absent fraud which is not alleged here, payment should become due in the circumstances set out in paragraphs C and D upon the certification made in accordance with their terms” (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Therefore, Sir Jeremy Cooke held that “the clear objective intention of the instrument is that payment should be triggered upon certification in accordance with paragraph C and that there should be no room for defence to such a certification by reason of the terms of paragraph D, absent fraud”. Once the demand was made in accordance with paragraph C, the defendant was liable to pay the sums certified without any deduction of any kind (<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The next English case is <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics</span>, which was within a banking context.

The payment guarantee provided (see <span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics </span>at [12]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) … we … IRREVOCABLY, ABSOLUTELY and UNCONDITIONALLY guarantee, as the <span class="font-italic">primary obligor</span> and not merely as the surety, the due and punctual payment by the BUYER of the 2nd instalment of the Contract Price … as specified in (2) below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) In the event that the BUYER fails to punctually pay the second Instalment guaranteed hereunder or the BUYER fails to pay any interest thereon, and any such default continues for a period of twenty (20) days, then, <span class="font-italic">upon receipt by us of your first written demand</span> stating that the Buyer has been in default of the payment obligation for twenty (20) days, we shall immediately pay to you or your assignee the unpaid 2nd Instalment, together with the Interest as specified in paragraph (3) hereof, without requesting you to take any or further action, procedure or step against the BUYER or with respect to any other security which you may hold.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 At the English High Court, Clarke J held that the contract was a traditional guarantee and not an on demand performance guarantee.

Sir William’s reasoning was as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 2 was premised upon the establishment of a failure of performance (including a failure of payment) under a relevant document (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [53]). Clauses 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) were framed in the “classic language of guarantee”, that is, “of a secondary obligation triggered upon proof of a breach of obligation by the principal” (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [44]) or “premised upon a failure of observance or performance of an underlying obligation (in the case of sub-clause (a)) or of punctual payment under an underlying obligation (in the case of sub-clause (b)) by a guaranteed party under a relevant document” (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clauses 2.1(d) and 2.1(e) were worded as primary obligations. Clause 2.1(c), although not prefaced by the expression “guarantee” (as clauses 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) were) had “the appearance of a secondary obligation” as it was “premised upon a default in payment by ‘a Guaranteed Party’” – the obligation was “to make good on demand any Secured Obligations which have not been paid at the time such demand [by the claimant] is made” (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The opening words of clause 2 were not effective to convert into purely primary obligations what were otherwise secondary in nature (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 3.1 did not lend support to the case that the contract was an on demand performance guarantee (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Clause 6 also did not lend support to the case that the contract was an on demand performance guarantee. Clauses 6.1–6.3 contained provisions one would expect to find in a guarantee. The “pay now, argue later” terms of clause 6.4 pointed to the existence of a secondary rather than to a primary liability. The clause assumed that the claimant may raise defences which the guaranteed party could have raised if the demand had been addressed to it, but, if the claimant’s liability were primary, the fact that the guaranteed party had or may have a defence to the demand would be immaterial (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Clause 11.2 was a “conclusive evidence provision” of a kind “commonly seen in guarantees” (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [50]). It also assumed that there was a breach of the obligation. Its reference to the certificate “setting forth the amount” of the secured obligation constituting “conclusive evidence … against the Guarantor in the absence of any manifest error” did not go to the existence of the breach (that is, liability). Instead, it went only to the quantum of liability (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh </span>at [50]). In other words, Sir William held that clause 11.2 did not prevent the guarantor from denying liability. Sir William further held that such conclusive evidence provisions should be strictly construed and any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the guarantor (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [50] and [51]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) As the case was outside the banking context, Sir William held that the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption against construing the contract as an on demand performance guarantee was not rebutted (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Carey Value</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The second English case which D1 relied on is <span class="font-italic">Carey Value Added, S.L. v Grupo Urvasco, S.A.</span> [2010] EWHC 1905 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Carey Value</span>”).

Those words were missing from clause 20.6. There was a major difference between a certificate as to “amount” and a certificate as to “amount due and payable”. Therefore, clause 20.6 only referred to the amount advanced, and not the amount due (<span class="font-italic">Carey Value </span>at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of the interpretive approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The foregoing outline of the caselaw shows that the courts’ approach to interpreting contracts of suretyships is consistent with the principles outlined at [48] above. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was important to bear in mind that labels were not necessarily helpful and might even serve to distract. It has been consistently held that the <span class="font-italic">form </span>and label used to describe a contract of suretyship (whether as guarantee, indemnity, or as an on demand performance guarantee) was not conclusive as to the nature of the contract <span class="font-italic">in substance</span>. The core issue was what was the nature of D1’s obligations under the Guarantee: was the liability primary or secondary; did the principle of co-extensiveness apply; and was D1’s liability to pay triggered upon a simple demand by the obligee under the Guarantee? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, when interpreting a contract of suretyship, the <span class="font-italic">text</span> of the contract was paramount. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, to interpret the nature of the obligations under the contract, the contractual clauses cannot be read in isolation. The document <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> had to be interpreted, and the court should not be simply undertaking a quantitative, box-ticking exercise to determine the number of factors in favour or against the interpretation of the document as an on demand performance guarantee (see [70(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, while there was a “strong presumption” under the common law against the existence of an on demand performance guarantee outside the banking context if the contract did not expressly label it as an on demand performance guarantee, one must be careful not to overstate the effect of that presumption. Ultimately, an evidential presumption of fact simply shifts the burden of proof to another party to rebut the presumed fact. Bearing in mind that the <span class="font-italic">form </span>used to label the contract of suretyship is not itself conclusive as to the nature of the obligation <span class="font-italic">in substance</span>, and that every case turns on its own facts, the court ultimately has to construe the text of the contractual clauses <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> to determine the nature of the obligor’s obligations under the contract. This was evident in the cases of <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 With the applicable principles in mind, I now turn to the Guarantee in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The clauses in the Guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The relevant clauses of the Guarantee provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Obligations</span>: Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1 The Guarantor [D1] hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1.1. Guarantees to the Vendor [D2] the due and punctual performance by the Operating Companies [UIL Singapore Pte Limited, UIL Hong Kong limited and UIL Commodities DMCC] of all of their obligations under or pursuant to the Materials Contract and other due payment and discharge of all moneys and liabilities whatsoever, whether actual or contingent, by way of principal, Interest or otherwise, which may be now or hereafter due, owing, or incurred to the Vendor [D2] by the Operating Companies (whether alone or jointly and whatever style, name or form and whether as principal or surety) or incurred by the Vendor on the Operating Companies' behalf under or pursuant to the Materials Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1.2. Undertakes that, if and whenever the Borrower fails to pay on the due date any sum whatsoever due and payable under or pursuant to the Materials Contract, the Guarantor shall pay such sum on demand by the Vendor and where requested by the Vendor, in the currency in which the same falls due for payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.2 As a separate and independent stipulation, the Guarantor [D1] hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, if any amounts hereby guaranteed are not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee, whether by reason of any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of the Operating Companies (or any of them) or any other fact or circumstance, whether known to the Vendor or the Guarantor not, then such amounts shall nevertheless be recoverable from the Guarantor as sole or principal debtor and shall be payable by the Guarantor on demand.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Conclusive evidence clause</span>: Clause 9.1 provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A certificate or determination by the Vendor as to the <span class="font-italic">moneys and liabilities</span> for the time being due, owing or incurred to the Vendor by the Operating Companies, or incurred by the Vendor on the Operating Companies behalf or, without limitation as to any other matter provided for in this Guarantee, shall (save in case of manifest error) for all purpose be <span class="font-italic">conclusive and binding</span> upon the Guarantee.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The plaintiffs’ instructed counsel, Mr Chan Leng Sun SC, submitted that the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee because the foregoing provisions were similar to the clauses in the cases of <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>, and the courts held in those cases that the contracts in question were on demand performance guarantees. D1’s instructed counsel, Mr Kenneth Tan SC (“Mr Tan SC”), submitted that the clauses and structure of the Guarantee showed that the Guarantee was not an on demand performance guarantee because D1’s liability was dependent on the Operating Companies’ breach of their payment obligations under the Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my judgment, bearing in mind that parties can and do draft modern contracts in such a way that they can contain separate enforceable obligations (see [61] above), I found that the Guarantee contained an obligation of a simple guarantee (under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2) with a separate enforceable obligation of an on demand performance guarantee (under clause 3.2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, it was clear that the obligation under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 was that of a guarantee rather than an indemnity. This was because D1’s liability to pay under clause 3.1.2 was only triggered “if and whenever the Borrower fails to pay on the due date any sum whatsoever <span class="font-italic">due and payable</span> under or pursuant to the Materials Contract” [emphasis added]. This was a clear stipulation that D1’s liability was contingent on the Operating Companies’ default on their obligations under the Contracts when those obligations became “due and payable”. This meant that D1’s liability under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 was secondary and the principle of co-extensiveness applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On the other hand, clause 3.2, when read together with clauses 9.1 and 7.3, clearly indicated that it gave rise to a separate and independent obligation under an on demand performance guarantee. This was for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Clause 3.2</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Under clause 3.2, it was significant that D1 (a) “irrevocably and unconditionally” agreed to provide a (b) “separate and independent” obligation to pay the obligee (c) “as sole or principal debtor”, and this liability was triggered (d) “on demand” (e) if “any amounts hereby guaranteed are <span class="font-italic">not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee</span>” [emphasis added]. All these factors were indicators that D1’s obligation to pay under clause 3.2 was a primary one that was not subject to the principle of co-extensiveness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 D1 submitted that clause 3.2 was not an on demand performance guarantee because it only applied “if any amounts hereby guaranteed are not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee” (the “Phrase”), which indicated that D1 would not be liable under clause 3.2 unless the Operating Companies’ breach of their payment obligations under the Contracts was first established. With respect, I was unable to agree with this submission. In my judgment, it was clear that the Phrase was specifying the <span class="font-italic">stated event</span> that triggered liability under clause 3.2: this stated event was when there were amounts owed under the Guarantee that were not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee. This stated event addressed the principle of co-extensiveness directly to state that <span class="font-italic">it </span><span class="font-italic">did not apply</span>. Therefore, for any amounts that were recoverable on the footing of a guarantee, D1’s liability would fall under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. For any amounts that were <span class="font-italic">not </span>recoverable by way of a guarantee (if, for instance, the underlying Contracts were unenforceable or void), then D1 would be liable as a <span class="font-italic">primary </span>debtor by reason of clause 3.2. Therefore, rather than being inconsistent with the nature of on demand performance guarantee, the Phrase expressly indicated that clause 3.2 was intended as one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It was important to bear in mind that liability under all contracts of suretyship, including on demand performance guarantees, will invariably only be triggered after an underlying obligation has been breached. This was recognised by the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> itself, a case heavily relied upon by D1, where Sir William Blackburne stated that liability under an on demand performance guarantee was triggered on the occurrence of a stated event that was usually “the non-fulfilment of a contractual obligation by the principal to that third party” (see [51] above). Indeed, this was the case for the contractual clauses in <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>: in <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span>, the clause stated that the obligor was liable to pay on demand “<span class="font-italic">if … the Guaranteed Moneys are not paid in full on their due date</span>” [emphasis added] (see [63(a)] above); in <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>, the relevant clause stated that the obligor had to pay on demand any amount certified by the vessel owners to be due to the owners “as a consequence of the Charterers <span class="font-italic">not having fulfilled their obligations under the Charter</span>” [emphasis added] (see paragraph C of the clause extracted at [66] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Therefore, the key determining factor was not whether the Guarantee envisioned an underlying obligation that had been breached; what was critical was whether D1’s liability under the Guarantee was <span class="font-italic">contingent on the principal debtor’s default</span> of the underlying obligation (see also <span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> at [44] (see [76(a)] above)). Clause 3.2 was<span class="font-italic"> not </span>contingent on such a default, so the clause did not indicate secondary liability on D1’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, there was also a contractual clause in <span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span> – clause 2.1(d) – that was similar to clause 3.2 in this case (see [75] above). Therefore, clause 3.2 alone was not sufficient to indicate the presence of an obligation of an on demand performance guarantee. As such, I turned to the other clauses in the Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Clause 9.1</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Clause 9.1 stated clearly that a “certificate or determination by the Vendor as to the <span class="font-italic">moneys and liabilities</span> for the time being due, owing or incurred to the Vendor by the Operating Companies … shall (save in case of manifest error) for all purpose be <span class="font-italic">conclusive and binding</span> upon the Guarantee” [emphasis added]. In the cases of <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital </span>and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>, the presence of clauses similar to clause 9.1 led to the courts’ findings that the contracts in those cases were on demand performance guarantees (see [65] and [67(a)] above). In <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span>, the English Court of Appeal held that the existence of a similar clause had put “the matter beyond doubt” as, “[a]part from manifest error, the [obligors] ha[d] bound themselves to pay on demand as primary obligor the amount stated in a certificate” (see [65] above). In <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>, while the clause in that case was worded differently from clause 9.1, it nevertheless provided that the guarantor would pay on demand “<span class="font-italic">any amount certified by Owners by written notice to be due to the Owners</span> …” [emphasis added] (see paragraph C of the clause at [66] above). Sir Jeremy Cooke found that the “certification of any amount as due as a consequence of non-fulfilment of [the principal debtor’s] obligations <span class="font-italic">must go, inevitably, to liability</span>” [emphasis added] (see [67(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 D1, relying on the principle that conclusive evidence clauses should be strictly construed (see [76(f)] above), submitted that clause 9.1 was only “conclusive” as to the quantum of money owed by D1 and not D1’s liability to pay. On D1’s submission, clause 9.1 did not indicate that the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee because it did not prevent D1 from denying liability when a demand to pay was made by the obligee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Conclusive evidence clauses are found in many standard form guarantees. The commercial function of a conclusive evidence clause is to avoid debate about the correctness of the calculation of any sums that are due if liability is established. Thus, a clause that refers to a certificate of the “amount” due or payable as being “conclusive evidence” should normally be construed as meaning that it is evidence only of the quantum of money owed and not of liability; instead, it would take explicit wording to make the liability of the obligor to pay conditional upon a certificate alone (see <span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millett</span> at para 1-016). This was consistent with the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Vossloh </span>and <span class="font-italic">Carey Value</span>, as the conclusive evidence clauses in those cases did not expressly state that the obligee’s certification or determination of the obligor’s “liability” was conclusive and binding (see clause 11.2 at [75] above and [77(d)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 However, clause 9.1 in the present case <span class="font-italic">did</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>explicitly provide that the obligee’s certification and determination of not only the “moneys” but also the “<span class="font-italic">liabilities</span>” due under the Guarantee was, save for manifest error, “<span class="font-italic">conclusive and binding</span>” on D1 [emphasis added]. The fact that clause 9.1 expressly referred to “liabilities” made it clear that this was not a typical conclusive evidence clause referred to in <span class="font-italic">Andrews and Millett </span>regarding the quantum of moneys owed. Instead, clause 9.1 prevented D1 from denying liability to pay once the obligee issued its demand on D1 to pay. As such, <span class="font-italic">Vossloh </span>and <span class="font-italic">Carey </span><span class="font-italic">Value</span> could be distinguished. Furthermore, the conclusive evidence clauses in <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen </span>did not even expressly state that the obligee’s certification of the obligor’s “liabilities” was conclusive and binding on the obligor (see [63(c)] and [66] above). As clause 9.1 did expressly state this, clause 9.1 stood on an even firmer footing than the clauses in <span class="font-italic">IIG Capital</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in showing that clause 3.2 of the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Clause 7.3 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Third, clause 7.3 stated that all payments that D1 had to make “shall be made without set-off or counterclaim”. Clause 7.3 was similar to paragraph D of the clause in<span class="font-italic"> Bitumen</span>, which led to Sir Jeremy Cooke’s decision that the contract in that case was an on demand performance guarantee, as payments which were certified by the obligee fell to be paid by the obligor “with no defence available of any kind” (see [67(b)] above). The plain text of clause 7.3 resulted in the same effect in this case, as clause 7.3 also prevented D1 from raising any set off<span class="font-italic"> </span>or counterclaims to seek to avoid paying for the sum certified by the obligee as being due and payable under clause 9.1<span class="font-italic">. </span>Thus, clause 7.3 further bolstered the interpretation that D1’s liability under clause 3.2 was a primary obligation not subject to the principle of co-extensiveness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Therefore, clause 3.2, read together with clauses 9.1 and 7.3, clearly showed that D1 had “irrevocably and unconditionally” agreed to provide a “separate and independent” obligation (from the guarantee obligation under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2) “as sole or principal debtor” to pay the obligee “on demand” any “moneys and liabilities” certified or determined by the obligee as “due, owing or incurred” to the obligee by the Operating Companies that were “not recoverable on the footing of a guarantee”, and that D1 had to make this payment “without set-off or counterclaim”. This was clearly a primary obligation on D1’s part to pay the obligee of the Guarantee on demand, and the principle of co-extensiveness did not apply. These were the defining characteristics of an on demand performance guarantee. Therefore, I found that clause 3.2, read together with clauses 9.1 and 7.3, was an on demand performance guarantee. Even if the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption applied in Singapore, it was clear from the plain text of the Guarantee as a whole that the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption was rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In any event, even if clause 3.2 was not an on demand performance guarantee, for the reasons I explained at [86] to [96] above, it was nevertheless clearly an <span class="font-italic">indemnity</span> that was triggered upon a simple demand by the obligee to pay, and payment had to be made without any set-off or counterclaim. Consequently, whether clause 3.2 was an on demand performance guarantee or an indemnity, D1’s liability to pay the obligee was clearly <span class="font-italic">primary </span>and the principle of co-extensiveness did not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Accordingly, when the plaintiffs issued the Letter of Demand on D1 to pay under the Guarantee for the Operating Companies’ liabilities under the Contracts, D1 was clearly liable to pay either (a) as a guarantor under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, since the Operating Companies had defaulted on their payment obligations under the Contracts or, (b) even if the USD 63.3m sum was not recoverable on the footing of the guarantee under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, D1 was still liable as a <span class="font-italic">primary </span>debtor to pay the plaintiffs the USD 63.3m sum under clause 3.2. It was thus not open to D1 to resist payment on the ground that the amount under the Guarantee was satisfied by the Hangji Security and/or GEM Security, which, even on D1’s own case, were securities for a <span class="font-italic">different contract</span> (the ATFF2 Loan). If D1 had any other independent claims against the plaintiffs, it was for D1 to claim that amount <span class="font-italic">separately </span>from the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position under Ontario law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For completeness, even if Ontario law governed the issue of whether the Guarantee was an on demand performance guarantee, I would have similarly found that clause 3.2, read together with clauses 9.1 and 7.3, gave rise to a separate enforceable obligation of an on demand performance guarantee. Ontario is a common law jurisdiction. D1 did not cite any Ontario cases on the law of on demand performance guarantees. From the cases cited to me by the plaintiffs’ counsel in their written submissions, it was clear that the legal principles on guarantees, indemnities, and on demand performance guarantees were not materially different between Singapore and Ontario. Most notably, in <span class="font-italic">Standard Trust v Mortgage Insurance Co</span> 1992 CarswellOnt 139 at [11], the Ontario Court of Justice held that an on demand performance guarantee was akin to letters of credit and that the obligor’s liability was not contingent on the principal debtor’s default of its obligations under the underlying contract: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Herman J. Wilton-Siegel in ‘International Business Agreements: Security For Payment’ found in Canadian Institute Proceedings (1990) The Art of Negotiating &amp; Drafting International Commercial Contracts has noted there <span class="font-italic">is little functional difference between a standby letter of credit and a performance guarantee</span>. <span class="font-italic">In both instances the issuer's obligation to pay is generally independent of the performance of the underlying contract</span>. Similarly, K.P. McGuinness in his treatise The Law of Guarantee (Carswell: Toronto 1986) has the following to say under the heading ‘Performance Guarantees’:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A performance guarantee (also known as an ‘on demand guarantee’ or a ‘first demand guarantee’) is a documentary form of security under which the issuer undertakes to guarantee the payment of a stipulated amount to a named or designated beneficiary, upon compliance with terms set out in the performance guarantee. As in the case of a letter of credit, payment under a performance guarantee generally must be made upon demand. <span class="font-italic">It is not usually necessary for the beneficiary to prove actual default by the principal</span>.  … Thus, in terms of both the nature of the obligation assumed and the type of institution likely to enter into such an undertaking, <span class="font-italic">performance guarantees are very </span><span class="font-italic">similar in nature of letters of credit, and indeed … it would seem that the two terms are synonymous</span> — the term ‘performance guarantee’ being used to describe this type of obligation in Europe, while the term ‘standby letter of credit’ is more common in American practice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The parties’ experts on Ontario law were also agreed in their affidavits (filed on the issue of set off) that, under Ontario law, a contract had to be read as a whole, in a plain and ordinary way, in light of the context in which the contract was made.

These were the Hangji and GEM Securities Defence and the Clause 6 Defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">D1’s defences regarding the Hangji Security and GEM Security</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">D1’s defence that no amount was owed under the Guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I first turn to the first prong of D1’s Hangji and GEM Securities Defence: that no amount was owed under the Guarantee because the Hangji Security and/or GEM Security could satisfy the amounts owed (see [24] above). In my judgment, this defence was unsustainable for two main reasons: it was uncertain and legally flawed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) D1’s pleadings were vague, unparticularised, and did not support its case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 First, in my judgment, this pleading was fundamentally flawed because it rested upon D1’s claim that it allegedly <span class="font-italic">agreed </span>with the plaintiffs to use the Hangji Security and GEM Security as security for the ATFF2 Loan (the “alleged Security Agreement”), but the date and terms of the alleged Security Agreement were not pleaded by D1 with any precision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In this regard, the findings of Steven Chong J (as His Honour then was) in <span class="font-italic">Likpin International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 962 (“<span class="font-italic">Likpin (HC)</span>”) are instructive. In that case, the plaintiff brought the suit against the defendants for the breach of an alleged oral charterparty which it referred to as a procurement agreement. The plaintiff pleaded that, “[i]n so far as it was made orally or by conduct, the Procurement Agreement was made during meetings held at the 1st Defendants’ [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] offices <span class="font-italic">on or about February 2009 to on or about 20th April 2009</span>” [emphasis added by Chong J] (<span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> at [40]). The defendants applied to strike out the plaintiff’s suit on the ground that, among others, the alleged agreement did not exist. Chong J struck out the plaintiff’s suit. Chong J held (at [42], [45] and [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 While it is possible for a party to plead (a) that a contract was made orally and merely evidenced in a written document; or (b) that the written document <span class="font-italic">per se</span> constitutes the agreement of the parties to be contractually bound, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there should only be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">one date</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> on which the contract could be said to have been concluded</span>: that is the date there was <span class="font-italic">consensus</span> <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> – a meeting of minds to be bound by terms which are both certain and complete.

Thus, I accept the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff’s inability to specifically identify when the Procurement Agreement was concluded points against the existence of the said agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 Thus, based on the plaintiff’s writ and statement of claim, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the terms of the Procurement Agreement are clearly too uncertain to form the basis of a legally enforceable contract</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 Moreover, in my view, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process to expect a defendant to defend a contractual claim when the plaintiff itself admits in its pleading that it is unsure of the most salient terms of the contract: the date of the contract; whether the contract was oral or written</span>; and the consideration which was agreed (in this case, the charter hire). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in underline; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The plaintiff’s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, as the Court of Appeal agreed with Chong J’s reasons that the plaintiff’s claims were legally and factually unsustainable (<span class="font-italic">Likpin International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1079 at [3]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In this case, D1’s pleadings on the date when the alleged Security Agreement was reached, and where and how it was reached, was not only vague but also morphed continuously with each new further and better particulars that D1 provided.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In D1’s defence, D1 did not plead the date when the alleged Security Agreement was reached:

A plain reading of D1’s further and better particulars above showed that that was exactly what D1 sought to do in its pleadings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, D1 could not even plead with certainty if the alleged Security Agreement was concluded in writing or orally, and, if orally, if it was by phone calls or at an in-person meeting. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, D1 also could not plead the date of the alleged Security Agreement with certainty. The pleaded date(s) when the alleged Security Agreement was reached was wide-ranging and unparticularised. The alleged Security Agreement spanned <span class="font-italic">three months</span> over emails (allegedly on 18 and 20 February 2019), one in-person meeting (allegedly on 21 February 2019), and/or two phone calls (22 March 2019 and/or 22 May 2019) for the Hangji Security; and two months over two phone calls (1 May 2019 and/or 26 July 2019) for the GEM Security. The fact that D1 pleaded such wide-ranging dates <span class="font-italic">both cumulatively</span> <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">alternatively </span>(“and/or”) spanning months showed that D1 was clearly experimenting with its pleadings.

There was no “meeting of minds” (<span class="font-italic">Likpin (HC)</span> at [43]; see [105] above). Instead, there were only multiple offers or suggestions uttered by various parties, which explained why the alleged Security Agreement took <span class="font-italic">months</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to purportedly “conclude”. Therefore, even taking D1’s pleadings at its highest, there was no agreement reached between the plaintiffs and D1 that the GEM Security and Hangji Security were to be used as security for the ATFF2 Loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 As such, D1’s case on the alleged Security Agreement was too uncertain to form the basis of a legally enforceable contract.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  David Sullivan’s 4th affidavit dated 28 June 2022, p 36, clause B(1)(p).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The alleged Security Agreement would have constituted an amendment to the Facility Agreement of the ATFF2 Loan, since it sought to use new securities – the GEM Security and Hangji Security – for the ATFF2 Loan. It was never suggested by the defendants that there was any “writing” regarding the alleged Security Agreement “in the prescribed format for amendments and signed and delivered to all relevant parties”. Therefore, none of the alleged oral agreements pleaded by D1 that formed the basis of the alleged Security Agreement could have been valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Consequently, I agreed with the plaintiffs that, even if the Guarantee was a simple guarantee, D1’s defence that no amount was owed under the Guarantee as the Hangji Security and GEM Security could “satisfy” these amounts was plainly legally and factually unsustainable, and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">D1’s defence of set-off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Next, I turn to D1’s alternative defence of set off relying on the GEM Security and Hangji Security (that is, that D1 could set off the amount claimed under the Guarantee against the value of the GEM Security and/or Hangji Security: see [22] above). This defence can be dealt with briefly. On this issue, D1 adduced expert evidence on Ontario law to submit that clause 7.3 did not cover equitable set-off. However, I found this argument to be contrived. Clause 7.3 unequivocally provided that all payments that D1 had to make under the Guarantee “shall be made without set-off or counterclaim”. The phrase “set off” was clearly broad enough to encompass both legal and equitable set off. If the parties had intended to limit clause 7.3 to legal set off, that would have been expressly stated in the clause. Thus, I agreed with the plaintiffs that, regardless of whether Singapore law or Ontario law applied, D1 could not seek to set off its liabilities under the Guarantee. In any event, as the defence of set off also depended on the alleged Security Agreement, which was a legally and factually unsustainable claim, I also found that D1’s defence of set off should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">D1’s defence regarding clause 6 of the ATFF2 Loan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I next turn to D1’s Clause 6 Defence, which was the claim that the plaintiffs allegedly could not invoke the rights under the Guarantee in respect of D2’s debts owed to the plaintiffs under the ATFF2 Loan (see [27] above). Mr Tan SC did not raise this defence at the hearing before me. Nevertheless, I will deal with this defence for completeness. This defence hinged on clause 6 of the Facility Agreement of the ATFF2 Loan, which provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. Security</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Security or Security Documents: As a Condition Precedent, the following Security Documents shall be executed to secure the Facility [ATFF2 Loan], including:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. Assignment of Rights in connection with the credit insured receivables, the sales contract, invoice and other related trade documents with notice delivered to the Approved Buyer and acknowledge of the same …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In my judgment, D1’s Clause 6 Defence was a non-starter, and Mr Tan SC rightly chose not to devote time to this defence in his oral submissions before me. Clause 6 was a condition precedent to the <span class="font-italic">ATFF2 Loan</span>. Even though the funds for the ATFF2 Loan were used by D2 to purchase metal from the Metal Suppliers to sell to the Operating Companies under the Contracts, the ATFF2 Loan was an entirely distinct agreement from not only the Guarantee but also the underlying obligation under the Guarantee (which was the Contracts).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Therefore, the Clause 6 Defence was legally unsustainable because the Guarantee was not pertaining to <span class="font-italic">D2’s debts </span>owed to the plaintiffs under the ATFF2 Loan to begin with – the Guarantee concerned the Operating Companies’ liabilities owed to D2 under the Contracts (see [81(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Accordingly, I found that D1’s Clause 6 Defence was, once again, completely contradictory to the plain text of the relevant contracts and legally flawed. As such, I found D1’s defence on this issue to be plainly unsustainable under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The assignment of the Guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I next turn to the issue of the assignment of the Guarantee. It first bears emphasis that the defendants did not dispute that the purported assignment of D2’s rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs was done pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">GSA and SD</span>. The defendants’ defences seeking to challenge the assignment of D2’s rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D2 sought to challenge the assignment by seeking to rescind the SD and GSA. D2’s defence seemingly flowed as such: the SD and GSA could allegedly be rescinded because the Forbearance Agreement could be rescinded, and this in turn was because no UIL HK Debt was owed, as the plaintiffs did not pay the Metal Suppliers directly, in breach of the alleged Payment Agreement (and the facility agreements under the ATFF1 Loan and ATFF2 Loan) (see [28] and [29] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) D1 sought to challenge the assignment on two primary grounds.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) First, D2 pleaded that clause 12.3 of the Guarantee required D2 to provide D1 with a notice of the assignment, but this was not done (see [26] above).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Second, D1 pleaded that D2 was seeking in the D2 Ontario Proceedings to discharge the Forbearance Agreement, the GSA, the SD, and the POAs (see [26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants’ defences on this issue should be struck out as they were plainly legally and factually sustainable and were thus frivolous or vexatious under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2014.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged agreement for the plaintiffs to pay the Metal Suppliers directly</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I first turn to D2’s defence. D2’s defence depended entirely on the existence of the alleged Payment Agreement (that is, the alleged agreement for the plaintiffs to remit the monies drawn down under the ATFF1 Loan and ATFF2 Loan directly to the Metal Suppliers instead of D2). However, in my judgment, this defence was also legally and factually unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 First, the fatal flaw to D2’s defence on the alleged Payment Agreement was that it was, similar to the alleged Security Agreement, wholly vague and uncertain. As aforementioned at [105] above, it was trite that any party making a claim for breach of contract has to clearly and accurately plead the material terms of the agreement breached. However, D2 <span class="font-italic">did not even plead</span> in its defence that the alleged Payment Agreement existed. Instead, D2 pleaded that P2 breached the terms of the two facility agreements under <span class="font-italic">the ATFF1 Loan and ATFF2 Loan</span>, <span class="font-italic">not </span>the alleged Payment Agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) … from in or around mid-2019, the 2nd Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">breached the terms of the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements</span> when it failed, refused, and/or neglected to extend monies in the sum of US$ 73,108,092.50 to pay the 2nd Defendant’s suppliers of metals and metal products, Triton Metallix Pte Limited (‘Triton’) and API International FZC (‘API’):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) The 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs were required to remit the monies drawn down under the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements directly to Triton and API, to pay for the supplies of metal and metal products purchased by the 2nd Defendant. But the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs failed, refused, and/or neglected to do so; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The 2nd Defendant relies on the 2nd Plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">breaches of the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements</span> in the Third Party Claims it commenced to, among other things, obtain contribution and indemnity from the 2nd Plaintiff in the proceedings commenced against the 2nd Defendant by (i) Triton for the sum of US$ 41,526,349.50 (i.e., CV-21-00001691-0000); and (ii) API for the sum of US$ 31,581,743.00 (i.e., CV-21-00001719-0000) (collectively, the ‘Material Suppliers Ontario Proceedings’).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In other words, D2’s pleaded case in its defence was that it was <span class="font-italic">the terms of the facility agreements under the ATFF1 Loan and ATFF2 Loan </span>which required the plaintiffs to remit the monies drawn down from the ATFF1 Loan and the ATFF2 Loan directly to the Metal Suppliers (instead of D2). However, the Facility Agreement under the ATFF2 Loan did not provide for such an alleged term at all. The plaintiffs thus sought further and better particulars from D2 to the question: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Please identify the clauses in the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements which contained the alleged obligation that the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs were required to remit the monies drawn down under the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements directly to Triton and API.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 It was only in response to this request that D2 then changed its entire position and finally pleaded the existence of the alleged Payment Agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The obligation incumbent upon the 1st and/or 2nd Plaintiff to remit monies drawn down under the 1st and/or 2nd Facility Agreements to Triton and API <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">was not set out in the 1st and/or 2nd Facility Agreements</span>. Instead, the Plaintiffs’ representative, Mr. Milne, and the 2nd Defendant’s representative, Mr. Modi, <span class="font-italic">verbally agreed, in or around the time the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements were executed </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(i.e., in or around 28 June 2017 and 24 May 2019),</span> that the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs would remit the monies drawn down under the 1st and 2nd Facility Agreements directly to Triton and API. [emphasis added in bold italics and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Therefore, D2 had changed its position: D2 only pleaded in its further and better particulars that it was not actually the terms of the ATFF1 Loan or ATFF2 Loan that the plaintiffs had allegedly breached by not paying the Metal Suppliers directly, but an <span class="font-italic">entirely separate </span>Payment Agreement that was breached. In these circumstances, D2’s defence was legally unsustainable:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was unclear <span class="font-italic">which </span>agreement was breached.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it was also not stated how a breach of the alleged Payment Agreement could lead to a breach of the facility agreements under the ATFF1 Loan or ATFF2 Loan, when these were distinct agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Second, as aforementioned at [111(d)] above, the Facility Agreement for the ATFF2 Loan expressly provided that no amendments to the Facility Agreement would be binding unless the amendments were in writing in the prescribed format and signed and delivered to all relevant parties. The alleged Payment Agreement would clearly have constituted an amendment to the Facility Agreement of the ATFF2 Loan, since it purportedly required the plaintiffs to remit monies drawn down under the ATFF2 Loan to a <span class="font-italic">non-party </span>to the Facility Agreement (the Metal Suppliers) rather than D2. However, D2’s own case was that the alleged Payment Agreement was entirely <span class="font-italic">verbal</span>. Therefore, even if D2’s case was taken at its highest, the alleged Payment Agreement could not have been legally valid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Third, the alleged Payment Agreement was unsupported by any objective evidence, whether by correspondence or otherwise. While the alleged Payment Agreement was verbal, these were large corporations negotiating a multi-million dollar agreement that was allegedly entered into on <span class="font-italic">two separate dates </span>that were two years apart (“in or around 28 June 2017 and 24 May 2019”). Yet, D2 was unable to adduce a shred of objective evidence, not even by informal internal correspondence, to support D2’s claim that the alleged Payment Agreement existed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 This lack of objective evidence was particularly damning in this case because the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">did</span> disburse the funds to the account which was stated in the drawdown notices. D2 itself stated this fact in its affidavit filed in this application:

</div> However, this claim was, once again, entirely unsustainable because Cantrust was a separate entity. If the alleged Payment Agreement were genuine, it did not make any sense that the plaintiffs would transfer the money to D2 <span class="font-italic">first</span> in order for D2 to further transfer the money to <span class="font-italic">another entity</span> (Cantrust) before the plaintiffs somehow finally caused that separate entity (Cantrust) to pay the Metal Suppliers directly; instead, the plaintiffs could have simply paid the Metal Suppliers directly. Furthermore, D2’s case was completely uncertain, as D2 was once again pleading vague alternative cases that were fundamentally inconsistent: on D2’s case, the plaintiffs had agreed to pay the Metal Suppliers directly by <span class="font-italic">either </span>transferring the monies to D2 first <span class="font-italic">or </span>by transferring the monies to the Metal Suppliers directly. There was, once again, not a shred of objective evidence to support D2’s case that the parties had reached such a <span class="font-italic">nuanced</span> agreement for the plaintiffs to, on some occasions, transfer the monies to D2 first but, on other occasions, pay the Metal Suppliers directly. As such, bearing in mind that it was undisputed that P2 did remit the monies drawn down from the ATFF2 Loan to D2, D2’s claim on the alleged Payment Agreement was plainly factually unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As such, for the foregoing reasons, it was plain that D2’s claim on the alleged Payment Agreement was legally and factually unsustainable. As D2’s entire defence hinged upon the alleged Payment Agreement, I found that D2’s defence was frivolous and vexatious and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Notice of assignment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I next turn to D1’s defence that it did not receive a notice of assignment from D2. This defence hinged on clause 12.3 of the Guarantee. That clause provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Vendor may transfer, assign and/or sub-participate all or any of its rights and benefits under this Guarantee, <span class="font-italic">without the consent of the Guarantor</span>. On such transfer, assignment or sub-participation, <span class="font-italic">the Vendor shall provide the Guarantor with notice of such transfer, assignment or sub-participation</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I agreed with the plaintiffs that clause 12.3 clearly did not stipulate that the assignment of any rights under the Guarantee was <span class="font-italic">conditional</span> upon giving notice of the assignment to D1. Nor was the consent of D1 required. Therefore, there was simply no basis to D1’s defence that the Guarantee was not validly assigned due to a purported failure to provide notice of the assignment to D1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Forbearance Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Finally, I turn to D1’s defence that D2 was seeking to rescind the Forbearance Agreement, the GSA, the SD, and the POAs in the D2 Ontario Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 First and foremost, as pointed out by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">UD Trading Group (AD)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45], it was questionable as to whether D1 even had standing to challenge D2’s assignment of its rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs. Therefore, strictly speaking, D1’s defence – that another party, <span class="font-italic">D2</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>was seeking to challenge the assignment <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> foreign proceedings </span>(Ontario) – was not an actual defence at law to the plaintiffs’ pleaded claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Second, as analysed at [119] to [128] above, D2’s actual pleaded defence challenging the assignment of its rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs was legally and factually unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Third, in any event, D2’s pleaded basis for seeking to rescind the SD and GSA was contradicted by the objective text of the Forbearance Agreement. D2’s defence was that, by rescinding the Forbearance Agreement, the SD and GSA could then also be rescinded (see [117(a)] above). However, as rightly pointed out by the plaintiffs, (a) the SD and GSA were distinct, standalone agreements from the Forbearance Agreement, and (b) the SD and GSA were the <span class="font-italic">conditions precedent</span> to the Forbearance Agreement, rather than the other way around. This was plain from the text of clause 3.1(d) of the Forbearance Agreement, which provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1 Conditions Precedent</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The obligations of the Lender to forbear under this Agreement shall not be effective unless and until the Lender and the Security Agent shall have received:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) any and all additional instruments, assignments, title certificates, security agreements or other documents or agreements that the Lender or the Security Agent may require to evidence or perfect or render opposable a lien or encumbrance on all present and after acquired property of the Borrower, or otherwise to give effect to the intent of this Agreement, including but not limited to (i) <span class="font-italic">an Ontario law governed general security agreement</span> in the form attached hereto as Schedule ‘C’ [that is, the GSA] and (ii) <span class="font-italic">a Hong Kong law governed general security deed</span> in the form attached hereto as Schedule ‘D’ [that is, the SD]. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Thus, clause 3.1(d) of the Forbearance Agreement clearly stipulated that the GSA and SD were the conditions precedent to the Forbearance Agreement. In other words, even if the Forbearance Agreement were rescinded, that would <span class="font-italic">not </span>lead to a rescission of the SD and GSA. D2’s defence that a rescission of the Forbearance Agreement would lead to a rescission of the GSA and SD was thus completely contradicted by the plain terms of the Forbearance Agreement itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As such, I agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendants’ defences challenging the assignment of D2’s rights under the Guarantee to the plaintiffs were plainly legally and factually unsustainable and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ancillary matter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Finally, for completeness, I briefly mention that, while the plaintiffs sought to submit that the defendants should be estopped from taking contrary positions against their admissions in the Ontario proceedings and findings made by the Ontario courts, I did not need to make any findings in this regard, as the foregoing factors were sufficient to lead me to the conclusion that the defendant’s defences should be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In summary, despite the best efforts of the defendants’ counsel, I found that this was a plain and obvious case for the defendants’ defences to be struck out. The defendants’ defences were not only defective but also entirely contradicted by the plain text of the Guarantee and the other contracts and documents raised by the parties. On the other hand, the plaintiffs’ pleaded case was clear and straightforward. As such, I made the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Guarantee contained an obligation of a simple guarantee (under clauses 3.1.1 and 3.1.2) and a separate enforceable obligation of an on demand performance guarantee (under clause 3.2 read with clauses 9.1 and 7.3). Even if clause 3.2 did not contain an on demand performance guarantee, it was clearly an indemnity obligation that was triggered upon the obligee’s demand to pay.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if the Guarantee were a guarantee, D1’s Hangji and Securities Defence and Clause 6 Defence were legally and factually unsustainable and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) D1’s and D2’s defences seeking to challenge D2’s assignment of its rights under the Guarantee were also plainly unsustainable and should be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Accordingly, I struck out the defendants’ defences and granted the plaintiffs’ judgment for the USD 63.3m sum against D1 plus interest with costs. Finally, I would like to record my gratitude to the parties’ counsel for their helpful and comprehensive submissions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Desmond Chong<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Leng Sun SC (Duxton Hill Chambers) (instructed), Bazul Ashhab, Lionel Chan, Nicholas Chang, and Esther Yong (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kenneth Tan SC (Kenneth Tan Partnership) (instructed), Eugene Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen, Hamza Malik and Ng Yuan Siang (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Koh, Imran Rahim, and Zerlina Yee (Eldan Law LLC) for the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
