</div> When payment was not forthcoming, the Respondent commenced Suit 50 of 2014 (“S 50/2014”) on 13 January 2014. The Appellant filed its defence and counterclaim against the Architect and the Respondent for the alleged numerous defects, delays and conspiracy. The Appellant also added the Architect and his firm, Chan Sau Yan Associates, as third parties.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings Below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proceedings before the AR </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Respondent applied for summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) on the basis of IC 25 and 26 in Summons No 1051 of 2014. The Appellant challenged the validity of the Disputed Certificates on the ground that they were tainted by fraud or improper pressure or interference under cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions. The following arguments by the Appellant were recorded by the AR in his minute sheet in the course of oral submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Architect should not have issued the Completion Certificate because the conditions for its issuance as stated in the parties’ contract were not satisfied.  Furthermore, the Completion Certificate was issued even <span class="font-italic">before</span> the TOP was. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Completion Certificate issued by the Architect raises doubts about his honesty because the schedule to that Completion Certificate (essentially a defects list) recorded only minor outstanding works whereas there were in fact “extensive defects” to the Buildings as reported by Chin Cheong.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Architect recklessly certified payment for landscaping works despite the wrong type of soil used (clayey sub-soil instead of loamy soil). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Architect was “reckless” in certifying payment in respect of the timber flooring because the timber strips used in the Buildings were 10 mm thick, and not 15 mm as specified by the Architect.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Architect granted unwarranted extensions of time for the Respondent to ensure that there was permanent electrical supply to the Buildings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Notwithstanding the arguments made, the AR was not satisfied that there were triable issues as to whether the disputed certificates were tainted by fraud, improper pressure or interference. He was of the view that the court should not be concerned with “shoddy, poor or unsatisfactory workmanship” and that the evidence borne out at the very highest shows that the Architect was merely negligent. It therefore cannot be said that he was acting fraudulently and accordingly granted summary judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Proceedings before the Judge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Appellant appealed against the AR’s decision but the appeal was dismissed with costs. The Judge first acknowledged that the Architect’s evidence, which we will turn to later, played a “significant role in [his] deliberation” in finding that the Disputed Certificates were not tainted by fraud, improper pressure or interference (Judgment at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge’s  reasons for rejecting each of the grounds to set aside the Disputed Certificates are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the evidence that the Respondent sought to rely on (set out in [12] above) were “circumstantial” and “insufficient to prove fraud” (Judgment at [56]). Furthermore, there was a qualitative difference between fraud and negligence. The Judge noted at [57]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If (and I am not suggesting that he was) the Architect was negligent in issuing the [Disputed] Certificates or issued the [Completion Certificate] prematurely, that was one thing. It is another to say that he was dishonest and in cahoots with the [Respondent]. In my view, the suspicion was specious and devoid of any cogent direct evidence. The reliance on circumstantial evidence and inferences was insufficient to meet the high standard required to prove fraud (see <span class="font-italic">Wu Yang</span> [<span class="font-italic">Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co Ltd</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 451] at [94]–[95]). In the circumstances, I dismissed the first ground of the … appeal. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Respondent (or his proxy) had exercised improper influence on the Architect (Judgment at [59]). The Judge then went on to hold at [59]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I accepted the [Respondent’s] evidence that the Architect’s decision to grant the [Completion Certificate] had been based on his professional judgement that the [p]roject could be enjoyed and occupied – it was consistent with the Architect’s evidence which was convincing and detailed … There was nothing to suggest otherwise. Therefore I also dismissed the … appeal on this ground.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, with regard to interference, the Judge said at [61]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There was no evidence to indicate that the [Respondent] had influenced the Architect. The [Appellant] insinuated that they [(the Respondent and the Architect)] had worked together on [a previous project, namely] the Mont Timah project and the Architect had approved the [c]ertificates despite the many alleged defects in the [p]roject. Thus they were in cahoots. However, I find that it was highly improbable given the manner in which the tender had been conducted and the involvement of other third parties in the certification process. It would have taken a lot of effort for the Architect’s independence to have been interfered with. Therefore, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Architect’s independence had been interfered with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Judge concluded by emphasising the importance of according the Disputed Certificates “temporary finality” in ensuring cash flow in the building and construction industry (Judgment at [62]–[63]). In dismissing the Appellant’s appeal, the Judge also ordered that the Appellant pay costs of $10,000 plus reasonable disbursements to the Respondent (Judgment at [63]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Dissatisfied, the Appellant filed his Notice of Appeal to this Court.

We therefore need say no more on this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In respect of the points raised in [20], the Appellant submits that summary judgment should not be granted lightly unless the allegation of fraud is frivolous and “practically moonshine” (see <span class="font-italic">Brinks Ltd and another v Abu-Saleh and others</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1478 at 1482, quoting Lord Lindley in <span class="font-italic">Codd v Delap</span> (1905) 92 L T 510 at 511). Furthermore, while it is true that cash flow is important in the building and construction industry, that does not mean that the “concept of temporary finality can be misused as a shield for excesses or abuses of power” (per Leow JC in <span class="font-italic">H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Chin Ivan</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1318 (“<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan (HC)</span>”) at [31]). Indeed, there are exceptions to temporary finality, namely, fraud, improper pressure or interference, and they are intended to act as a safeguard against such possible misuses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Respondent’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Thulasidas s/o Rengasamy Suppramaniam (“Mr Thulasidas”), counsel for the Respondent, argues that the Judge was right in upholding the decision of the AR in granting summary judgment for the sums due under the Disputed Certificates. Mr Thulasidas submits: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Appellant cannot argue that the Disputed Certificates were tainted by fraud simply by taking issue with the issuance of the Completion Certificate. This is because the Disputed Certificates and the Completion Certificate are completely different certificates issued apart from one another. The Disputed Certificates were issued some months after the Completion Certificate was issued (the Disputed Certificates were issued on 3 September and 6 November 2013, whereas the Completion Certificate was issued earlier on 15 May 2013). As such, the Disputed Certificates are “not directly attacked”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the Appellant merely raises a myriad of circumstantial evidence that is not sufficiently cogent to prove fraud. Indeed, the defects raised by the BCA with regard to the two failed TOP inspections were minor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the Architect had a “genuine honest subjective<span class="font-italic"> </span>belief” that the works were substantially complete, and that the defects on the Buildings were trivial and minor when he issued the Completion Certificate. He therefore cannot be faulted for genuine mistakes he made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The central issue in this appeal against the entry of summary judgment is whether the Appellant has made out any of the grounds found in cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions so as to deprive IC 25 and 26 of temporary finality.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Clauses 31(13) and 37(3)(h) of the SIA Conditions provide as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31.(13) <span class="font-italic">No certificate of the Architect</span> under this Contract shall be final and binding in any dispute between the Employer and the Contractor, whether before an arbitrator or in the Courts, <span class="font-italic">save only that, in the absence of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party</span><span class="font-italic">, full effect by way of Summary Judgment or Interim Award</span> or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, <span class="font-italic">be given to all decisions and certificates</span> of the Architect (other than a Cost of Termination Certificate or a Termination Delay Certificate under Clause 32.(8) of these Conditions), whether for payment or otherwise, <span class="font-italic">until final judgment or award</span>, as the case may be, and <span class="font-italic">until such final judgment or award such decision or certificates shall … be binding on the Employer and the Contractor in relation to any matter which, under the terms of the Contract, the Architect has a fact taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the terms of the Contract he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or otherwise</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Architect shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> In any case of doubt the Architect shall, at the request of either party, state in writing within 28 days whether he has a fact taken account of or allowed or disallowed or ruled upon any matter in his certificates, if so identifying any certificate and indicating the amount (if any) taken into account or allowed or disallowed, or the nature of any ruling made by him, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37.(3)(h) pursuant to Clause 31.(13) of these Conditions, <span class="font-italic">temporary effect shall be given to all certificates</span> (other than a Cost of Termination or Termination Delay Certificate under Clause 32.(8) of these Conditions), whether for payment or otherwise, granted (or refused) by the Architect  …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The ambit and extent of the temporary finality accorded to interim payment certificates under these clauses in the SIA Conditions has been the subject of a comprehensive and authoritative judgment by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan v H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 124 (“<span class="font-italic">Chin </span>Ivan”) and to a lesser extent in <span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties Pte Ltd v Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 622 (“<span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties</span><span class="font-italic">”)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In construing cl 31(13), this Court in <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> stated  at [18]–[19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 However, the granting of such temporary finality to an [a]rchitect’s certificate is subject to certain conditions that are stipulated within cl 31(13). First, the certificate must be issued “in the absence of fraud or improper pressure or interference by either party”. Secondly, it must be issued “<span class="font-italic">strictly</span> in accordance with the terms of the Contract” [emphasis added]. … Thirdly, as can be seen from the need for the Architect to clarify, upon either party’s request “[i]n any case of doubt”, what was or was not taken into account in his certificate, the Architect must have considered the matters which are said to have been dealt with in his certificate. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 The need for an [a]rchitect’s certificate to cohere with the conditions laid down in cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions was also recognised by this court in <span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties Pte Ltd v Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd</span> …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This Court also pointed out at [20] that “a properly-issued [a]rchitect’s certificate functions as a condition precedent to the contractor’s right to receive payment and the employer’s right to deduct claims (if any).” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 These three paragraphs lie at the heart of the principle of temporary finality under the SIA Conditions. The role played by the architect in certifying payment is crucial because it is the integrity of his certification process and proper certification that confers temporary finality on his certificates and therefore enforceability by summary judgment. As this Court pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Chin</span><span class="font-italic"> Ivan</span>, the enforcement stage differs from the final and determinative arbitration or court proceedings brought to obtain a final and binding determination of the parties’ disputes in the “project” where architects’ certificates may be ‘opened up’ by the arbitral tribunal or the court, (referred to as “substantive proceedings” in <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> at [21] and [22] and citing Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Construction Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 4th Ed, 2012) at vol 1, paras 8.12-8.13). At the enforcement stage of interim payment certificates, the court is not concerned with the merits of the architect’s certificates (see <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan </span>at [21]). Hence “a mere allegation of irregularity cannot suffice to undermine the validity of such a certificate” and “any allegation must be backed up by evidence, at the very least, so as to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of irregularity” (<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It would be instructive to examine <span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> to illustrate how these principles were applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the architect had issued 28 interim payment certificates; the first 16 interim payment certificates were paid but the remaining 12, issued between September 1984 and January 1987, remained outstanding. In March 1985, the architect had given final extensions of time to 31 December 1984 for completion of the main building works and to 18 February 1985 for external works. Practical completion was certified on 1 July 1985, the owner entered into possession on 2 July 1985 and the defects liability period ended on 1 July 1986. On 9 September 1987, when settlement discussions failed, the contractor commenced proceedings and applied for summary judgment for $1,785,294.32 (excluding contractual interest) based on the interim certificates. The owner filed an application for a stay pending arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On 24 November 1987, whilst these applications were pending, the owner wrote to the architect querying whether all the certified work had been carried out and whether the condition precedent under cl 23(2), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, written notification of entitlements to extensions of time, had been complied with before he issued his extensions of time. On 2 December 1987, the architect wrote to the contractor stating that save for one item, his previous extensions of time were null and void because the contractor had failed to comply with the condition precedent under cl 23(2) and separately certified that works ought to have been completed by 31 May 1984 and the contractor was in delay. On 15 December 1987, the architect issued 17 replacement interim certificates, which included the 12 unpaid interim certificates, and issued one further interim payment certificate. This resulted in cross-claims being available to the owner which exceeded the contractor’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Both the trial judge and this court were unanimous that on these facts, (which included the architect’s revocation of his previous extensions of time, his re-valuation of the interim payment certificates, his issuing of a further interim payment certificate which was not issued in compliance with cl 31(1) and (2) as it was issued long after completion of the works, “recording” in his certificate entitlement to liquidated damages more than two and a half years after practical completion and only after the owner had written to him), the court was entitled to draw the conclusion that there was undue interference and/or improper pressure by the owner thereby depriving these certificates of any temporary finality enforceable by summary process.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan,</span> the contractor commenced an action and applied for summary judgment on two interim payment certificates (“the disputed certificates”). The employer resisted the claim alleging that the disputed certificates were procured by fraud on the part of the contractor. The employer showed, and it was not disputed by the contractor, that the architect issued ‘Instructions’ under the SIA Conditions approving various items (“the disputed items”) on the contractor’s list of variation works on the basis that they were: “[a]s informed by [the contractor], … requested by [the employer]/[the employer’s project manager]” (<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> at [5]). These architect’s instructions were thus not issued by the architect based on his professional judgment, but were <span class="font-italic">purely</span> on the basis of the contractor’s representation that the variation works in question had been “requested” by the employer.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The disputed certificates had certified various payments, which included the disputed items totalling $321,383.94 as well as other items. The judge below made three findings of fact, which were not challenged on appeal (at [24]). First, the architect stated he included the disputed items because the contractor informed him that the employer had consented to the inclusion of these items; secondly, the contractor denied making any such representation to the architect; and thirdly, it was not disputed that the employer had never consented to the inclusion of the disputed items for valuation. This court noted that on these three findings of fact, the trial judge below was correct in finding that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of fraud was made out. But more than that, this court went on to state that in light of these facts, “it <span class="font-italic">could not have been disputed</span> that the [d]isputed [c]ertificates had not been issued in accordance with cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions” [emphasis in original] and went on to note at [25] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the [a]rchitect was telling the truth, then the inevitable conclusion would seem to be that the [contractor], in representing that the [employer] consented to the Disputed Items’ inclusion for valuation purposes, had defrauded him. On the other hand, if the [contractor] was telling the truth, (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he never made such representations to the [a]rchitect), then the [a]rchitect must have issued the Disputed Certificates improperly since, as noted … above, implicit in his statement in the [architect’s instructions] and his letter of 21 March 2014 was the assertion that he did not include the Disputed Items as a matter of his professional assessment; and on this basis, his subsequent claim as to the representations allegedly made to him by the [contractor] would seem to suggest an ill-conceived attempt to cover up his error. In either scenario, the [a]rchitect would not have applied his mind to the Disputed Items when he included them in the Disputed Certificates. In these circumstances it could not possibly be said that these certificates had been issued in accordance with the parties’ contract. It must follow from this that the entire basis of the [contractor’s] claim fails since there was no certificate properly issued by the [a]rchitect which the [contractor] could rely on to sustain its claim. …       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This court ruled that even if the irregularities only affected <span class="font-italic">part</span> of an interim payment certificate, there could be no severance and under the SIA Conditions that deprived the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> certificate of temporary finality. These certificates ceased to attract any temporary finality because they were in some material part not issued strictly in accordance with the contract and/or were tainted by fraud or improper pressure or interference (<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> at [26] and [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 These cases illustrate the nature and level of scrutiny of the integrity of the certification process leading up to the interim payment certificate as well as the importance of proper certification “strictly” in accordance with the terms of the contract. They also illustrate the requisite levels of proof to determine if the temporary finality is unravelled due to fraud or irregularity. These cases also emphasize that at the enforcement stage, the courts are not otherwise concerned with the merits of the architect’s certificates, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, whether the certificates are ultimately correct as to the matters they purport to deal with. The question at this enforcement stage is whether the architect’s certificates were validly issued in accordance with the terms of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan </span>at [21])<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Before we turn to examine the facts of this case, it would be appropriate to address Mr Pillay’s submissions on the Architect’s certificates being affected by fraud under the first condition of cl 31(13). Mr Pillay does not rely on improper pressure or interference in the appeal but only on the reckless conduct of the architect in his certification amounting to fraud.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We agree with Mr Pillay’s submission that recklessness in certification, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, careless whether it is true or false, can amount to fraud under cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions.

We pick one example. When the Architect issued the Completion Certificate, he had attached a list of defects to be rectified, which by industry practice are usually minor. Under the heading “MINOR OUTSTANDING WORKS”, the Architect had surprisingly listed, amongst others, some significant items which would have obviously caused the buildings to fail their TOP inspection:

It is anything but minor. Staircases are potentially dangerous structures because tripping and falling on staircases can have very dire consequences including serious physical injury or even death. The BCA’s Approved Document: Acceptable Solutions (Version 4.0, July 2011) (“BCA Approved Document”), issued by the Commissioner pursuant to Regulation 27 of the Building Control Regulations 2003 has detailed provisions governing this aspect, especially at clauses E.3.4.1 and E.3.4.2 as to minimum sizes of the ‘tread’, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the horizontal part of a step on which a person’s foot will rest (275 mm) and the maximum height of ‘risers’, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the vertical height of a step (175 mm) in staircases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 More importantly, at clause E.3.4.4 of the BCA Approved Document, risers have to be equal save for a 5mm construction tolerance between consecutive steps. Persons involved in the building and construction industry are aware of a known human behavioural trait. Most people only look at a staircase when they negotiate the first few steps. Thereafter their gaze goes elsewhere because they assume the steps are equal in rise or drop. Any non-uniform change in the rise or drop could potentially result in that person tripping or losing his balance and falling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 When the Architect issued the Completion Certificate, he already knew from the TOP inspection that there was an important defect in unlevelled steps and unequal risers in all staircases. As noted above, the Architect acknowledged the existence of these defects in his attachment to the Completion Certificate as requiring rectification: see [51] above. These staircases were thus clearly not safe for use by occupants of the Buildings when the Architect issued his Completion Certificate. We cannot but help point out the rather slick drafting in the Architect’s affidavit five paragraphs later.

</div> further failures to comply with the <span class="font-italic">same </span>requirements as to risers and treads were noted by the BCA in another area – the steps at the reinforced concrete flat roof for all units and the last step at the landscaped area of Unit No 12A.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, we deal with Mr Thulasidas’s contention that cl 24(4) overrides Item 72 of the Preliminaries. With respect, we cannot accept this submission at all. Article 6 of the Articles of Agreement set out the Contract documents. Article 7 provides that the Contract Documents should be read and construed as a whole “and no special priority other than that accorded by law shall apply to any one document or group of documents, nor shall the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span> rule apply either to these Articles or to the Conditions of Building Contract.” Moreover, the general rule at law in the construction of documents is that all other things being equal, a term specifically drafted for a particular contract takes precedence over a standard term (<span class="font-italic">Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd (The Starsin) </span>[2004] 1 AC 715 at [11] and <span class="font-italic">Fenice Investments Inc v Jerram Falkus Construction Ltd</span> [2009] EWHC 3272 at [26]).<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>This rule has been cited with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Multiplex Construction Pty Ltd v Sintal Enterprise Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 530 at [26]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Item 72 being a specially drafted term should therefore take precedence over the printed conditions. This can be compared to some other standard form contracts which contain a provision stating that that nothing contained in the contract bills or bills of quantities shall override, modify, or affect in any way whatsoever the application or interpretation of the conditions (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, HKIA Standard Form of Building Contract (With Quantities)) or have specific provisions setting out which document takes priority over another. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In any event, there is no discrepancy between cl 24(4) and Item 72 in the present case. Indeed cl 24(4) requires the Architect to issue the Completion Certificate when the works appear to be complete “and <span class="font-italic">to comply</span> with the Contract <span class="font-italic">in all respects</span>” [emphasis added]. It cannot be argued that Item 72 is not part of the Contract or that its requirements do not have to be met. In fact the parties do not dispute that Item 72 is contained within Section 1 of the Preliminaries and the Preliminaries in turn form an important part of the contract containing the bills or bills of quantities or schedules of rates or prices or the specifications of works which set out, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, details of the works, the contractor’s obligations, what equipment will be provided and what will not, requirements for the execution of the works, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, all of which will enable the contractor to more accurately price his works and prolongation expenses. Item 72 can be seen to complement and describe in more detail what the contractor’s obligations are, including those in relation to completion.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We therefore are driven to the conclusion that the Completion Certificate was very clearly not issued properly under the terms and conditions of the contract and is an invalid exercise of the Architect’s powers and duties under this contract. On the facts of this case and the evidence before us at this enforcement stage, it is clear that the Architect issued the Completion Certificate at least without belief in its truth and/or recklessly without caring whether it was true or false. The Architect’s affidavit and his contradictory and shifting statements only serve to underscore the serious irregularity in his certification and certification process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Completion Certificate affected IC 25 and 26</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Mr Thulasidas argues that whatever went wrong with the Completion Certificate, IC 25 and 26 are different certificates and were issued some time apart.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 With respect, however, we cannot agree with this argument because first, it ignores the fact that the Completion Certificate is an important milestone certificate under the SIA Conditions and its issue triggers other certificates and milestones at this end-phase of the construction contract. For example, under cl 31(9), the Completion Certificate triggers the release of one moiety of the retention monies less only a reasonable sum to cover the cost of outstanding works. The Maintenance Period also starts to run under cl 27(1) as does the time for the contractor to submit its Final Accounts Documents under cl 31(11). The issue or non-issue of the Completion Certificate has significant consequences on other certificates and/or related issues, including liquidated damages for delay. Secondly, IC 25 and 26 are in themselves questionable. We deal with this in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Architect failed to certify the release of one moiety of the retention sum upon issuing his Completion Certificate, as he should have under cl 31(9) of the SIA Conditions. Clause 31(9) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to Clauses 25 and 26 of these Conditions in regard to Phased or Stage Completion or Partial Occupation, <span class="font-italic">one-half of the Retention Monies not yet paid </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall be certified</span><span class="font-italic"> as due to the Contractor </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on the issue of the Completion Certificate under Clause 24.(4)</span><span class="font-italic"> of these Conditions, </span>less only a reasonable sum to cover the cost of outstanding work (if any) not yet completed pursuant to Clause 24.(5) of these Conditions at the date of the said Certificate. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whilst cl 31(9) allows the Architect to withhold a reasonable sum to cover the cost of outstanding work not yet completed, if any, there is no evidence from the Architect that this was the case or that it was withheld for that reason. Instead, IC 25 was issued some 4½ months after the works were, in the opinion of the Architect, “complete” and complied in all respects with the contract and some 3 months and 19 days after he issued his Completion Certificate. The evidence shows the full moiety of the retention sum was released. In Interim Certificate 24 dated 1 July 2013 (“IC 24”), the retention sum was $644,195.65. In IC 25 (dated 3 September 2013) the retention sum was reduced to $315,945.65. The retention sum released to the Respondent was thus $328,250 or approximately 51% of the retention sum certified in IC 24. There is <span class="font-italic">no</span> explanation from the Architect whatsoever, despite his acknowledging in para 36 of his affidavit that 50% of the “retention sum <span class="font-italic">…</span><span class="font-italic"> had to be released</span> upon the issuance of the Completion Certificate” (emphasis added). IC 25 clearly did not comply with cl 31(13)’s stricture that the Architect “shall in all matters certify strictly in accordance with the terms of the Contract”. The Interim Certificate is invalidly issued and therefore cannot have any temporary finality under the SIA Conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 We also find it strange that the Respondent did not appear to have made any complaint about the late release of the retention sum, especially since it appears that the Respondent was, on its own admission, in a weak financial position: see [17] above. Dennis Tan had this to say in an affidavit filed in related proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, OS 317/2014:

If the Performance Bond is allowed to be called upon, EQ would proceed against us and we can ill afford to pay and will probably be wound up or the Directors bankrupted thus preventing us from continuing with Suit No. 50 of 2014 [ie, the suit commenced by the Respondent for recovery of the sums owed under IC 25 and 26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Most contractors, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, a contractor with financial issues, would be eagerly waiting for this release of a moiety of the retention sum and one would not expect a contractor to remain silent when this not insignificant sum was not being certified for release upon issue of the Completion Certificate. Indeed, the Judge who heard SUM 5454/2014 granted the application for stay of execution of his Judgment precisely because there must have been concerns over the Respondent’s financial position: see [18] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The foregoing would invalidate IC 25. However, the amount certified in IC 25 is also questionable. IC 25 is dated 3 September 2013 and as noted above, certified payment of $390,951.96, of which $328,250 comprised the release of the first moiety of the retention sum under cl 31(9) of the SIA Conditions. IC 26 dated 6 November 2013 certified payment of $189.250.21. If works were complete as of 17 April 2013 and the works complied with the contract in all respects and fulfilled all the requirements of Item 72, why are these sums for work done being certified for payment months after certified completion on the terms of this contract? In so asking, we should not be taken to rule that there can never be interim payment certificates after completion. There are a number of valid reasons why such certificates may be issued, including correcting undervaluation of previous certificates (see cl 31(6)), items that were previously missed out by the parties, payment for variations (especially those that were issued late in the course of the project), or claims for work done in the month before completion. The Appellant makes this point in his affidavit:

The fact that S$917,228.26 was certified by the Architects in Interim Certificates No. 23 to 26 indicates that there was still a significant amount of work to be done as of the date of Completion as certified by the Architects and not just minor works as suggested by the Architects in their Completion Certificate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It does seem incongruent that if the works were as complete as the contract required and as certified by the Architect, and given the scheme of interim claims and interim payments under the SIA Conditions, interim payment certificates were being issued some 4½ months and 6½ months after contract completion. It is also uncharacteristic for a contractor with financial issues to wait so long after having completed his works to make his interim payment claims. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the Architect offers no explanation in his affidavit. He merely deposes at paras 35 and 51:

The value of works certified in Interim Certificates No. 23 to 26 of $917,228.26 were for works carried out prior to completion or for sums payable as a consequence of completion and are not as the Defendant claims indicative of an alleged "significant amount of work to be done" as at the date of completion".</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51. Interim Certificates No. 25 and 26 were for works completed, and are unrelated to the defects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In one sense, paragraph 51 is true. The certificates are unrelated to the defects. An examination of the “minor” defective items listed in Annexes 1.1 to 1.4 of the Completion Certificate (comprising some 109 pages of photographs with captioned “defects”) in relation to Unit Nos 12, 12A, 12B and the external works show just that, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, minor items for rectification, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, ceiling painting patchy, hole at ceiling to patch, remove floor marble stain, timber floor surface damaged, edge of wall painting to touch-up, aluminium window lockset loosen, cabinet doors not flush, aluminium capping loosened, <span class="font-italic">etc. </span>These are not works for which payment under the contract is due. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It behoves the Architect, whose certificates are being challenged in these circumstances, to furnish an explanation for the payment certified under IC 25 and IC 26 when he filed his affidavit. Although not strictly applicable to the filling of affidavits, it is nonetheless of relevance to note that under cl 31(13) of the SIA Conditions, there is a duty on the part of the Architect to clarify upon either party’s request “[i]n any case of doubt”, what was or was not taken into account in his certificate. In <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span> at [18], this Court stipulated this as one of the requirements that confers temporary finality on the architect’s certificates in that his clarification, if requested, would set out the basis of <span class="font-italic">his</span> independent professional judgment. Here, in the light of these proceedings, to which he is a party, one would have expected the Architect to explain the basis of the disputed certificates. But, for reasons best known to himself, he has chosen not to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 We note a second strange feature of this case. Whilst the Architect has given fairly detailed explanations for his time extensions and the alleged defects, in stark contrast, he says very little substantively about the completion and even less about what items were comprised in IC 25 and IC 26: see [74] above. We note that instead, it is the Respondent’s Dennis Tan who attempts to explain what was being certified for payment under IC 25 and IC 26. It is important for us to point out that where certificates are being impugned, it is not for the Respondent, who is a party to the dispute with the Appellant, to speak for the Architect. In enforcement proceedings, where the temporary finality of his certificates are in question, it is important for the courts to hear from the Architect himself about his certification process and on the certificates he issued; this is especially so where he has been made a party to the action and therefore has the opportunity to explain his position and certification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Accordingly, what the Respondent, (or Appellant for that matter) has to say in these circumstances is of very little weight. Thus if there are serious and legitimate doubts about the Architect’s certification, and if the Architect has chosen not to explain his certification, it will often be insufficient for an interested party to do so on his behalf. Nonetheless, without derogating from the foregoing, we shall put that to one side and examine Dennis Tan’s explanations contained in his 3rd affidavit dated 30 April 2014. He attributed the amount certified under IC 25 to prime cost (“PC”) adjustments. At para 17, he states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The $337,892.94 worth of work was not done after completion. The amount certified was not because of the work being done after completion but because of the PC rate adjustments.  The [Respondent] had completed all the PC rate items like marble, tiles, granite, timber parquet, timber decking by Mar 2012 (see under Main Building Works for Interim Valuation from No.22 to No.25 … wherein the amounts were capped at about 95% until PC rates are adjusted on a later date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Dennis Tan’s explanation is not only quite unconvincing, it is instead misleading by making reference across five payment certificates, IC 22 to IC 26, because they stretch from an Interim Valuation (“IV”) as of 14 March 2013 (about one month before “completion”) to 31 October 2013. We should point out that the Interim Certificates do not show the PC items. We have to look at the accompanying Interim Valuation for the “Prime Cost &amp; Provisional Sums” (“the PC Items”). A perusal of the Interim Valuation by M/S Faithful &amp; Gould, the quantity surveyors, shows there was indeed an increase in the PC Items, but that occurred between the Interim Valuation for IC 23 and IC 24. The PC Items increased from $596,015.15 to $788,126.90. However the PC Items in the Interim Valuations for IC 24 and IC 25 <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">emain unchanged</span> and in IC 26 there was only a very small increase of $19.19 compared to IC 25:

Secondly, this fact, <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> shows that there were no further works done between the issue of IC 23 dated 30 April 2013 and IC 25 dated 3 September 2013 as valued by the quantity surveyor because the level of completion of these units by value did not change. On the evidence before us, IC 25’s $62,701.96 (the remainder after deducting $328,250 of retention monies released) could not have been for any PC rate adjustments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For the above reasons, it is very clear that IC 25 was not issued strictly in accordance with the terms of the contract, and accordingly cannot be accorded temporary finality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We turn now to IC 26. Like IC 25, we find IC 26’s certification to be questionable for the same reasons set out above. Moreover, if completion took place on 17 April 2013, then the maintenance period started to run from 18 April 2013 and would end on 17 April 2014. Under cl 31(11)(a), the Respondent had to submit his Final Account Documents to the Architect and quantity surveyor showing the final value of all works carried out by him, including variations, together with all supporting documents. If completion had truly taken place in accordance with the contract, then one can legitimately ask what was being certified for payment some 6½ months after completion. In the absence of any explanation, one would expect, especially for this Respondent, to be busy with his Final Account Documents. IC 26 dated 6 November 2013 certified payment of $189,250.21 for work carried out by the Respondent. As noted above at [74], except for the laconic assertion that this payment was for completed works, the Architect has chosen <span class="font-italic">not</span> to explain what was certified in IC 26. If the Disputed Certificates were indeed for work that was completed before or by 17 April 2013, then the earlier certificates must have been erroneous. There is no explanation why these sums were not included in the appropriate earlier interim payment certification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Again, it is the Respondent, not the Architect, who tries to furnish the explanation. The Respondent maintains no new work was done but instead offers two reasons for the sum certified for payment in IC 26:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the sum on IC 26 was due to completed works and “[t]he PC rate adjustments were made between the QS Consultants and the [Respondent] when the project was nearing completion and has no bearing on the interim progress”.

Unless there were omissions or sums withheld over quality issues, of which no evidence at all has been proffered, it defies belief that at 86.35% completion by value, all services, including M&amp;E services, could have been tested, commissioned and found to be operating satisfactorily.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the omission of $205,605.41 is separated under Interim Valuation No.26 whereas it was still under M&amp;E Works in Interim Valuation No.25 … In fact, the amount certified for Interim Valuation No.26 was only $31,150.00 because the physical works were already completed before 17.4.13. This certified sum is for the submission of operation manual and drawings and the regularization of the contract sum arising from variation works …$236,755.41 worth of M&amp;E work was not done after completion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 This explanation by the Respondent is difficult to understand or follow but the following points can be made: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first point to note is the admission by the Respondent that IC 26’s payment for M&amp;E items was for the submission of “operation manuals”. This means Item 72(b) was not fully complied with until after IV 25 which valued works as at 31 July 2013.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The next point of note is the Respondent’s cryptic remarks referring to an omission of $205,605.41 which “was separated” in IC 26 whereas it was “still under M&amp;E works in [IC 25]”. The Respondent then states that the net certification for M&amp;E works in IC 26 was only $31,150 which was for the submission of operation manuals, drawings and “the regularization of the contract sum arising from variation works”. It is difficult to make much sense of these statements.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On their face, the interim certificates (as is usual in the industry) do not have a sufficient level of breakdown to validate the first point made in Dennis Tan’s statement above at (b), <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, it does not contain a separate M&amp;E component, let alone the figure $205,605.41, as M&amp;E works are within the item: “Work carried out by Contractor: $11,334,625.80” (for IC 25).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) When we turn to the immediate underlying document, the interim valuation by the quantity surveyors, IV No 25 only shows the M&amp;E works as a one line item containing the M&amp;E Contract Sum, the Contractor’s Claim, the Valuation and Remarks. It is important to note that it <span class="font-italic">does not show</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>an omission of $205,605.41 since the M&amp;E Contract sums remains at $2,294,002 and the Respondent’s Claim and QS Valuation stands at $2,031,200.59 (and in IV 24, the same M&amp;E Contract sum appears with a Contractor’s Claim and QS Valuation of $2,002,712.59). There is no other notation showing an omission of that nature or sum on the rest of that document comprising IV 25.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In IV 26, although the same one-line M&amp;E Contract Sum of $2,294,002 is stated, as noted before, the Contractor’s Claim and Valuation by the QS is now $2,267,956.00, an increase of $236,755.41 which is 98.86% of the ME Contract Value. However, we now find the $205,605.41 figure stated by Dennis Tan in IV 26. It appears as Item 7 variations at (b) where there is an omission of $205,605.41. No such omission appears in the earlier interim valuations. Half of Dennis Tan’s first point is correct – we do find that omission in IV 26. However his point that the $205,605.41 omission in IV 25 was under M&amp;E Works is not correct.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) We now move down a further level, since these are M&amp;E Works, to examine the M&amp;E consultants’ valuation and payment recommendations (“M&amp;E Valuation”); again some, but not all or complete copies, are exhibited in Dennis Tan’s affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) As a preliminary point, the M&amp;E Valuations are confusing because they carry the same progress claim number 26 but have different dates which seem to indicate that M&amp;E Valuation No 26 dated 12 August 2013

</div> (but which we note may not be the full document), where there are items with sums corresponding or approximately corresponding to those found in these EIs:</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(A) EI 01 for $4,635 has a corresponding sum in this document against S/No 26, AI No 18, “Additional of Emergency Lights” with the remarks “Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 01, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer”;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(B) EI 02 for $194,800.59 has an approximate corresponding sum in this document at S/No 25, AI No 16 where the first line carries the words: “Omission of Provisional Sum ($400,000)” and the second line has “Supply and delivery of light fittings and accessories $196,748.60” and with similar remarks: “Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 02, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer”;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(C) EI 03 for $2,640 has a corresponding sum in this document against S/No 27, AI No 23 with the words: “Supply and install water sub-meters for swimming pools” and with similar remarks: “Regularize Engineer instruction; M &amp; E 03, as advised by M&amp;E Engineer”; and</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(D) EI 04 for $16,031 has a corresponding sum in this document at S/No 23, AI No 3 with the words: “Additional jacuzzi jet” and with similar remarks: “As advised by M&amp;E Engineer”.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) This raises more questions than it provides possible answers. The obvious question arises from the discrepancy in the date of this document and the dates recorded in the M&amp;E Valuations for the EIs. There is no explanation as to the nature of this document, what it represents or whether AI means Architect’s Instructions under the SIA Conditions or just costings for consideration of these items and not necessarily items that were in fact ordered and installed. It also does not tell us whether the works comprised in these items were carried out or not and if so when. If these were variations ordered by January 2013, then at least IC 22 (19 April 2013) and the interim certificates after that, and probably a few interim certificates prior to that, were wrong and under-certified. This would include IC 23 and IC 24. Importantly, we do not know if this is a complete document and equally importantly, there were other items in this document which do not appear in the EIs set out in M&amp;E Valuation No 25 as one would expect, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, S/No 28, AI No 25 with the description: “Supply and delivery of light fittings and accessories”, “21,453.421” and with the remarks: “As advised by M&amp;E Engineer”.    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) M&amp;E Valuation No 26 shows the Original Contract/Sub-Contract Value at $2,294,002 as well as EI 01 to EI 04, but there is now an EI 05 which records an omission of $423,712 thereby bringing the revised M&amp;E subcontract value down to $2,088,396.59. EI 05 has also not been put in evidence. This raises the following doubts:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Why was such a large omission being effected by an EI at this late stage? There is no explanation as to what these <span class="font-italic">M&amp;E omissions</span> comprised of. Importantly, if the contract works were completed as of 17 April 2013, that there can be an omission of this size and at this stage cries out for a compelling explanation. It is possible for works to be omitted for various reasons including reducing the amount of works for cost or aesthetic considerations or because they were no longer needed or because the contractor cannot supply or do the works or that parts of the M&amp;E works were no longer necessary. Reasons like this should bring about an omission by an EI at a much earlier point in time and <span class="font-italic">before</span> completion. Unfortunately the Architect and M&amp;E consultant have chosen to remain silent.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii)  Although Dennis Tan seems to suggest a specific omission or omissions amounting to $205,605.41 that was within IC 25, which as we have said above cannot be the case, it seems that that figure comes from deducting $218,106.59 comprised in EI 01 to EI 04 (issued after 6 June 2013) from this omission of $423,712 by EI 05 in or around 30 September 2013. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii)  Importantly, if an omission of this large sum occurred before completion on 17 April 2013, or at some earlier stage and was being accounted for only in M&amp;E Valuation No 26 and/or IV 26, in the sense of reducing the M&amp;E Contract Sum only at that stage, then the previous valuations of works done by the M&amp;E Consultants and the Quantity Surveyors were erroneous and any Interim Certificate based on these valuations would be similarly erroneous and invalid and certainly could not be clothed with temporary finality under cl 31(13);  $423,712 is an omission of 18.47% of the original M&amp;E Sub-contract sum or 16.86% of the revised M&amp;E Sub-contract value after adding EI 01 to EI 04.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It may well be the case that at the substantive or final determinative arbitral or court proceedings matters will be clearer with all the relevant and complete documents being produced and the parties are cross-examined. However, at this stage, based on what appears in IC 26 and its immediate underlying documents, there are serious irregularities and unexplained discrepancies that deprive IC 26 of any temporary finality.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Besides these serious irregularities, and the fact that the maintenance period as set out in the Completion Certificate was clearly wrong, there is another glaring omission. The Architect ignores delays and, as a consequence of delay, liquidated damages. Whilst the Architect has dealt in some detail with the extension of time in paras 17 to 34 of his affidavit,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Dennis Tan Chong Keat’s 2nd affidavit dated 7 April 2014 (ROA Vol III (Part I) at p 226. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We have also referred to the evidence of delayed production of the operating manuals, a requirement for completion under Item 72(b). It goes without saying that duly certified liquidated damages would be available as a set-off against any sums certified due to a contractor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Lastly, it is also clear that the Architect was partly responsible for the Buildings failing the TOP inspections: see [61] and [62] above. Both the Respondent and the Architect are silent as to what was done to remedy this. In a normal case, there would have been an instruction from the Architect to the Respondent to carry out these additional works. There would then have been an attendant extension of time and payment for variation work. These additional works must have been carried out otherwise TOP would not have been eventually obtained. No doubt all these issues will be explored at the substantive hearing stage.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In view of the foregoing, the Architect was clearly in breach of cl 31(13) when he issued IC 25 and 26 as they were not issued strictly in accordance with the terms of the contract. Moreover, in our judgment, when the Architect issued these certificates, he could not have had any belief in their truth or he did so recklessly without caring whether they were true or false. The Disputed Certificates have thereby lost the temporary finality that would otherwise have been conferred on them by the SIA Conditions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the other defects in the Buildings removed temporary finality </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Our reasons and conclusions above are sufficient to dispose of this appeal. Nonetheless, for completeness, and for the avoidance of doubt in future cases, we will deal with the other arguments raised by the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Pillay submits that the Architect was guilty of reckless certification on the facts of the case and that this amounts to fraud under cl 31(13). First, Mr Pillay says the Architect issued the Completion Certificate despite there being extensive defects. These defects are all listed and photographed by an independent building surveyor to give substantiation to this allegation: see [20(b)] above. It is true that there are numerous defects listed in this report and equally numerous photographs allegedly evidencing this state of affairs. Mr Pillay also points to the evidence, including Daniel Tay’s Report which states that the wrong type of soil, clayey sub-soil and not loamy soil as called for under the specifications, was provided. Yet the Architect went on to certify acceptance and payment for these works. Mr Pillay also points to wrong-sized timber decking being provided, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 10 mm thick instead of the 15 mm specified by the Architect, yet they were accepted and duly certified by the Architect. In response to these allegations, the Architect states in para 43 of his affidavit that “the alleged defects … are … minor and are not uncommon for newly completed projects.” The Architect then goes on to set out his disagreement with the Appellant’s allegations in paras 43 to 52 and 61 to 63 of his affidavit. The Respondent broadly maintained that the works were not defective and denied that they were at fault.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  See <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Plaintiff’s Supplementary Submissions before the AR.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We note the Respondent failed to meet these allegations other than in generalised terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Notwithstanding this, on the evidence before us, we cannot accept any of these factors as being valid reasons in themselves to withhold temporary finality from IC 25 and 26.  As we have noted at [28] above, at the enforcement stage, the court is not concerned with the merits of the certificates. The court will not go into whether, <span class="font-italic">for instance</span>, the soil was loamy soil or not or whether it complied with the specifications. Nor can the court go into whether the timber decking was 10 mm or 15 mm or whether the specification called for 10 mm or 15 mm thick pieces of timber. To do otherwise would be to drive unwarranted inroads into the principle of temporary finality that is embedded in cl 31(13). “Opening up” the Architect’s certificates must be left to substantive final determinative arbitration or court action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Payment certificates however, are of a different nature from the kind of certification under discussion here. On their face, payment certificates deal with resultant totals and sub-totals, the details of which do not appear on the payment certificate itself. For the supporting figures, breakdown or calculations, one has to look to the immediate underlying or supporting document. This is invariably the interim valuation compiled by the project quantity surveyor. This finds support in practice because in all well run construction contracts, the interim valuation is attached to or issued with the payment certificate. This interim valuation will also contain remarks as to why a particular claim has been paid in part or not paid because, for example, it was rejected for non-compliance with the specifications. These remarks and explanations in the interim valuation often comprise the payment response for adjudication under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed). In turn, for special components like the M&amp;E works, one goes down further to the immediate underlying document, the M&amp;E engineer or consultant’s valuation. This does <span class="font-italic">not </span>amount to “opening up” the payment certificate. First, the figures in these sets of documents either add up or they do not. There is no grey area in arithmetic. Secondly, and importantly, the Architect has chosen not to explain or clarify his certification. Thirdly, the court looks at what is written on the face of these documents and does not examine, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the stated reason for an omission of an individual item, unless there is something so obviously wrong with that statement that it cannot, on any basis, be true or correct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Every case must depend on its own special facts. Whilst we will not lay down a hard and fast rule to say there can never be a case where the evidence, as distinct from the process of certification and proper certification strictly in accordance with the terms of the contract, is so clear as to support a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>finding of fraud or recklessness or irregularity in relation to the merits or contents of an architect’s certificate under the SIA Conditions, such a case must be rare and quite exceptional.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 This case is exceptional in our view and findings. It must be seen against what must be numerous construction projects contracted on the SIA Conditions which are completed without such serious irregularities and errors in certification. What this case does unfortunately illustrate is that some architects, like those in <span class="font-italic">Lojan Properties</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chin Ivan</span>, project their profession in a very poor light when they administer their contracts with such disregard for its terms and conditions and which are, after all, those of a standard form put forward by their own professional organisation. In the vast majority of cases of this nature, it is the architect, (albeit with assistance from the quantity surveyors), who compiles and puts forward the construction contract, to the owner and contractor, for execution. To then disregard, in a sense their own contract terms and conditions or to display ignorance of some of its terms or content seems to be very unfortunate and tarnishes the good name of their profession.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Needless to say, the defence based on fraud and serious irregularity is not, at this stage, a complete one, and this should not preclude the Appellant from having their defences tested at trial. Our findings at this enforcement stage, depriving IC 25 and IC 26 of temporary finality, will necessarily be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> and non-conclusive at the substantive and final determination of the disputes between the parties (see <span class="font-italic">The “Chem Orchid”</span><span class="font-italic"> and another matter</span> [2016] SGCA 04 (<span class="font-italic">The “Chem Orchid”</span>) at [47] and [48];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [127]-[129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal. The judgment and orders for costs entered into below by the AR and the Judge are set aside and the Appellant is to have his costs here and below (including the costs of and incidental to the application in SUM 5454/2014 which were reserved to this Court: see [17] above), such costs to be agreed or taxed. There will be the usual consequential orders for the release of monies furnished by the Appellant as security for costs for this appeal and the sum of $640,816.32 ordered by the Judge to be paid into court by the Appellant are to be paid out to the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin    Andrew Phang Boon Leong  Quentin Loh<br/>Judge of Appeal   Judge of Appeal   Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohan Reviendran Pillay, Yeo Boon Tat and Danna Er (MPillay) for the appellant;<br/>Thulasidas s/o Rengasamy Suppramaniam (Ling Das &amp; Partners) for the respondent.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
