The accused was then brought up to unit #11-234 (“the flat”) in the same block of flats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The CNB officers gained access into the flat using the accused’s keys. They also opened the door of the master bedroom using those keys. The accused was the tenant of the master bedroom in the flat. He lived in that bedroom with his girlfriend. The bedroom had a walk-in wardrobe where the accused stored his belongings.

</div> When asked if he had anything to surrender, he pointed to the rightmost shelf above the drawers of the wardrobe, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the pigeon hole on the right side of the wardrobe (“the pigeonhole”). The following items were inside the pigeon hole:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A shoe bag which contained a stack of white envelopes, numerous empty sachets, the empty box of a digital weighing scale and its instruction manual; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A white metal container (“the bowl”) containing brownish granular substance and a metal spoon;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A dark blue plastic bag containing four plastic packets of brownish granular substances; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A digital weighing scale, a pair of scissors, a roll of masking tape and a red plastic bag which was empty and folded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the hanging compartment of the wardrobe above the pigeon hole (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the top right section of the wardrobe), there were<span style="color: rgba(0,176,80,1)"> </span>a red plastic bag which contained one small packet of brownish granular substance, one small packet of brownish powdery substance, one stained metal spoon and four used syringes and their plastic wrappers. A grey plastic bag containing two plastic packets was also found on the floor near the master bedroom door.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The substances inside the bowl and the four packets inside the dark blue plastic bag weighed about 2.21kg. They were analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and found to contain at least 38.84g of diamorphine (hereafter referred to as heroin) in total. The bowl contained at least 7.80g of heroin while the four packets contained at least 10.96g, 8.10g, 4.36g and 7.62g of heroin. The heroin in the five exhibits formed the subject of the trafficking charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 During the trial, a question arose over the weight of the drugs in the bowl. They weighed 456.51g at the CNB but only 442.4g at the HSA. Because of the discrepancy of 14.11g, the accused sought clarification on whether the drugs in the bowl were the same drugs that were subsequently analysed by the HSA and found to contain 7.80g of heroin. The accused claimed that the CNB’s weighing scale was calibrated to start from a negative figure equal to the weight of the plastic bag that the drugs in the bowl were emptied into. The plastic bag containing the drugs was then weighed to arrive at the reading of 456.51g. Therefore, he contended, this amount was that of the drugs alone as the weight of the plastic bag had already been accounted for.

When the exhibits were photographed at the CNB, the bowl and the spoon were removed from the Ziploc bag and placed on a piece of brown paper. The drugs were then poured from the Ziploc bag into the bowl before the photographs were taken.

</div> After that, the drugs were poured back into the Ziploc bag. The Ziploc bag and the drugs it contained were then weighed to arrive at the reading of 456.51g.

</div> She removed the larger bag and weighed the Ziploc bag and its contents, which reflected 457.82g (1.31g more than the CNB reading). She then weighed the Ziploc bag alone and noted that its weight was 15.38g. Therefore, the weight of the drugs alone was about 442.44g. Ms Lim said that the 1.31g discrepancy could be due to the fact that the weighing incidents took place at different locations and times and using different weighing instruments. Having heard the explanations, I was satisfied that there was no break in the chain of custody in relation to the drugs in the bowl and that the drugs weighed were those specified in the CNB’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The prosecution relied on seven statements that were made by the accused.

After he pointed to the pigeonhole, he was asked what was there. He replied: “everything inside.” He looked nervous and sweated profusely. He also said that the shoe bag had “always been there” when he was asked who owned the shoe bag.

</div> Michelle Sim recorded an oral statement from the accused in her field book. He allegedly informed her that the drugs in the bowl were for packing and selling. In the cautioned statement on 4 August 2011 at about 3.28pm, he said: “I disagree with the charge above and find it very inaccurate. I could not think of anything else to say as I am feeling unwell.” The trafficking charge then alleged that he possessed for the purpose of trafficking six packets and one bowl weighing 2,237.97g of granular/powdery substances believed to contain diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In a long statement recorded on 11 August 2011 at 2.25pm (“the first long statement”), the accused said that he collected two packets of heroin from his drug supplier, Abang. Each packet weighed about one pound. Shortly before his arrest, he sold one packet and poured the second packet of heroin into the bowl with the intention of packing it later. He denied knowledge of the four packets inside the dark blue plastic bag. The two small packets of heroin in the hanging compartment of the wardrobe were for his personal consumption. An extract of the first long statement reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. On 2nd August 2011 at about 7pm or 8pm in the evening, I called my drug supplier Abang on his handphone and ordered 2 ‘batu’ of heroin from him. ‘Batu’ means a packet of heroin which weighs roughly a pound. I told Abang that I would pay him for 1 ‘batu’ of heroin upon the drug collection first and then pay the 2nd ‘batu’ of heroin later in the night. He agreed and we hung up. I did not tell him the price or the location to meet because this is not the first time I had bought drugs from him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. On 3rd August 2011 at about 5pm plus in the afternoon, Abang called me on my Nokia handphone and told me that my order is ready for collection. I told him okay and I would proceed to meet him at our usual place. Our usual meet up point for the drug collection would be at the void deck of Blk 687A Choa Chu Kang Drive. I then left my house and walked towards there. Along the way, I saw him driving a car and making a U-turn along Choa Chu Kang Drive. He then stopped along the roadside of Blk 687 Choa Chu Kang Drive which is a multi-storey carpark and I saw that there is a male Indian sitting at the front passenger seat of the car. I have never seen the male Indian before and he never introduced himself at all. He just opened the door and handed over to me a grey plastic bag.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. When I took over the grey plastic bag, I also handed over S$5,300/- which are in denominations of S$50/- and S$10/-, all rolled and bundled up with a rubber band to the male Indian. I felt that the contents in the grey plastic bag were heavier than usual and I looked at Abang immediately who was at the driver’s seat. He then signaled that he would call me later. I agreed and we parted. Along the way home, I opened up the grey plastic bag and looked inside. I saw the 2 ‘batu’ of heroin which I had ordered from Abang earlier and another dark blue plastic bag which was folded neatly and its content could not be seen. I also received a call from Abang and he told me to hold on to his plastic bag and he would come and collect it later in the night when he collects the remaining money from me. I agreed and proceeded home.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. After a 5 minutes walk, I reached home and took out the 2 ‘batu’ of heroin from the grey plastic bag and put it aside. I also took out the dark blue plastic bag from the grey plastic bag and put it in one of my cubicles of my wardrobe. I did not open to see the contents but I felt that it was heavy. My first guess of the contents in the dark blue plastic bag was that it could be Abang’s personal belongings. Then I thought it could be a decoy because previously when I bought drugs from him, he wrapped the drugs up in a rice packet along with packets of actual rice and packets of curry as well. I do not think that it was ‘batu’ of heroin because I did not order so many drugs as I could not afford it. I placed the dark blue plastic bag in the cubicle of my wardrobe because I just feel like keeping it there as Abang told me he would collect it back later.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. I then made a call to one of my drug client Bob who had previously tried to order 1 ‘batu’ of heroin from me. That time, I do not have the drugs with me yet so I told him I would call him once the drugs is here. When he answered his handphone, I told him that the 1 ‘batu’ of heroin is here already and it would cost S$5700. He agreed and we arranged to meet at Hillview area in 30 minutes time. We then hung up the phone.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. I then immediately repacked 1 ‘batu’ of heroin into a new packet because the existing one was tattered and some of the heroin might have leaked out from the packet. I did not weigh it at all. Therefore, I just pour the heroin from the 1 ‘batu’ of heroin into a new plastic bag and seal it manually using a lighter and my fingers. Then, I placed the ‘batu’ of heroin into a black and gold plastic bag and put it aside to be delivered later. After that, I emptied out the other ‘batu’ of heroin into a white metal bowl and I put it in the cubicle of my wardrobe because I intend to pack it later in the night when I return home. I then threw away the 2 plastic packets and the grey plastic bag but I could not remember if I had put them all together.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. Shortly after, I left home with the black and gold plastic bag and took a taxi from below my house to the shophouses located at Jalan Remaja in Hillview area. I met up with Bob outside a 7-11 store and handed over to him the black and gold plastic bag which contains the 1 ‘batu’ of heroin. Bob then handed over to me S$5,700/- which are also in denominations of S$50/- and S$10/-, all rolled and bundled up with a rubber band. Bob did not open up to check the contents of the plastic bag because we were in a public place. We then parted and I took a taxi back home.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. When I reached home, I called Abang on his handphone and told him that I have collected enough money to pay for the rest of my consignment which was the 2nd ‘batu’ of heroin. Abang told me that he is already nearby my house area and he told me to meet him along the main road near Blk 666 Choa Chu Kang Crescent which is in front of a 7-11 store. I agreed and I asked him if he wants to collect back his personal belongings but he say he would call me back later in the night. We then hung up the phone. I then took out S$400/- from the cash bundle that Bob had earlier given me and kept the money in my drawer of my room. That is the place where my girlfriend Sabrena and I would normally keep our money together. A short while later, I left home and walked towards our meeting place.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. When I reached, Abang was already there along the roadside. This time, he was riding a blue and white scooter with a Malaysia plate which I could not remember the number. However, I could recognize that this was the bike Abang always rode to deliver drugs to me previously. I then passed the S$5300/- of cash to Abang and he left on the motorbike. I proceeded to walk towards Yew Tee MRT station because I wanted to buy dinner for myself. Along the way, I was arrested by a group of plainclothes officers who later identified themselves as CNB officers.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12. The officers then brought me to my flat at Blk 686B Choa Chu Kang Crescent #11-234 and entered the unit using my house keys. They also entered my rented bedroom using the same bunch of keys and a search was conducted. I informed the officers where I kept my drugs which is the ‘batu’ of heroin that had already been poured into the white metal bowl as well as the cubicle where I kept my syringes and paraphernalia as well as the 2 small packets of heroin which is meant for my own drug consumption. While going through my wardrobe, the officers found the dark blue plastic bag in the cubicle and they opened it to look inside. They then showed me the drugs in the dark blue plastic bag and I saw 4 ‘batu’ of heroin in it. It was also the first time that I had seen the contents of the dark blue plastic bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the second long statement on 13 August 2011 at 3.45pm (“the second long statement”), the accused confirmed that the first long statement was true and correct. He maintained that he ordered only two packets of heroin and not six. He said that when the CNB officers showed him the four packets of heroin in the blue plastic bag in his bedroom, “I felt very surprised that the dark blue plastic bag actually contains so much heroin as I did not order it at all. Furthermore, I could not even afford to pay for so much drugs.” He went on to say that he worked as a part-time nightclub bouncer, earning $600-$700 a month. Occasionally, he also worked as a freelance odd job labourer earning about $100 per month (which he corrected during oral testimony to $100 per trip on average as it was a delivery job).

Sometime near the end of 2010, he happened to meet Man. He told Man about his financial difficulties and his drug addiction. Man offered him a solution, which was to sell drugs. That way, the accused could make some money and satisfy his drug habit at the same time. Man then introduced the accused to Abang, Man’s drug supplier, over the telephone.

The accused described Abang as a short, chubby male Indian Malaysian. They communicated in Malay and agreed on the price of $5,300 for each “batu” (or pound) of heroin. From then until his arrest, the accused met Abang about once or twice a week to collect the drugs he had ordered. He would always order one or two “batu” of heroin on each occasion.

Among other things, the accused said that at the time of the alleged offence, he was using 12g of heroin a day via the intravenous route. Dr Koh’s opinion was that the accused had opioid dependence, had a psychotic episode in the past (the accused was treated for possible drug induced psychosis in 2008) but had been free of psychotic symptoms for many years, was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence and was fit to plead.

</div> Dr Koh provided a further opinion dated 1 August 2014 after reading the report produced by Dr Munidasa Winslow and Dr Julia CY Lam, the accused’s psychiatrist and psychologist who examined him jointly. Dr Koh said that if the accused’s assertions about his drug use of 12g per day and his withdrawal symptoms were accepted, he would concur with Dr Winslow and Dr Lam that he had moderate to severe heroin dependence. However, he noted that the accused’s self-report of his withdrawal symptoms appeared discrepant from what was observed by the various doctors who examined him in the few days after his arrest.

They also reviewed the medical reports of the doctors who had seen the accused. In their joint report dated 15 May 2014, they stated that the accused reported being a heavy user of heroin who used about 12g of heroin daily to avoid withdrawal symptoms at the time of his arrest. His last “fix” before his arrest was at about 7-8pm. After his arrest, he experienced the following withdrawal symptoms: restlessness, joint discomfort, vomiting, yawning, anxiety, goose bumps, runny nose, urge to defecate, pain in the soles of the feet and difficulty in sleeping. The withdrawal symptoms lasted about five to six days. When he gave the first long statement, his thinking was “not there”. He felt the normal discomfort of heroin withdrawal, joint and back aches, restlessness and insomnia. The report stated that his “self-reported symptoms of moderate heroin withdrawal symptoms were consistent with his self-reported daily dosage (12g) of heroin consumed during that period”. The reported stated that based on medical literature, the severity and duration of opioid withdrawal were greater in users who injected rather than smoked heroin. However, the dosage and the method of intake, while related significantly to the severity of withdrawal, accounted only for about 50% of variance of withdrawal scores. Other psychological factors such as anxiety also played a role in the overall perceived severity of withdrawal. It was well-documented that there was a poor correlation between the amount of heroin consumed and the severity of withdrawal symptoms. The report concluded that the accused was heroin dependent at the time of his arrest. It was possible that his usage was 12g/day given his history and tolerance due to his daily injecting usage (since mid-2010). They noted the discrepancies between his self-reported symptoms and those observed in the medical reports of the doctors. However, their reading of the raw medical notes indicated “moderately severe withdrawal symptoms”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At the trial, Dr Winslow testified that the accused’s self-reported symptoms put him somewhere between moderate and moderate-severe in terms of withdrawal.

</div> It is normal to have discrepancies between self-reported withdrawal signs and observed signs.

For example, there may be no visible watering in milder cases of runny nose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Each person varies in the withdrawal symptoms exhibited. Generally, the longer the period of heroin use and the greater the amount of heroin used, the more likely it is to have withdrawal symptoms.

However, it was quite difficult to tell the correlation between the level of morphine in one’s urine and the level of consumption due to the variables involved. These include, for example, the time period between the last use of heroin and the urine test and the purity of the heroin taken.

</div> Most addicts who consumed heroin at higher levels needed to support their consumption habit by selling a portion of the heroin that they had bought to offset the cost of their own use. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), any person who is proved to have in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine is presumed to have had that drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking unless he proves that his possession was not for that purpose. To rebut the presumption, the accused must prove that the five packets of low grade heroin (in the bowl and the dark blue plastic bag) were for his own consumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The accused had to show that he had a high level of consumption in order to account for the large amount of heroin in his possession. To do that, he would have to show that he could afford to sustain his alleged pattern of consumption of heroin. The prosecution attempted to show that the accused could not have afforded his alleged consumption level by comparing his income with his drug expenditure and living expenses in 2011. However, those matters happened quite some time ago and in fairness to the accused, he could not be expected to recall them with a great deal of certainty. Nevertheless, the general picture that emerged was that the accused had irregular jobs and was constantly in need of money. He could not therefore have sustained the alleged level of consumption of heroin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Even if the accused was expecting some money from his late father’s estate in Malaysia, there was no evidence that he managed to secure the $20,000 advance from his uncle in late April 2011. His uncle would be able to testify about the alleged advance but he was not called as a witness by the defence. When asked why his uncle could not testify, the accused said that his uncle is a Malaysian and does not reside in Singapore. He said that when his uncle and his aunt visited him after his arrest in 2011, they were surprised and shocked that he had lived so frivolously and squandered his inheritance in such a way. He then said that he attempted to contact his uncle through his sisters but his sisters stopped visiting him since August 2014.

</div> These explanations were hardly convincing. He could have asked his defence counsel for assistance in contacting his sisters in Singapore or his uncle in Malaysia. After all, he appeared to have no difficulty getting in touch with his uncle earlier in April 2011. The prison authorities here would probably have his uncle’s particulars too since he visited the accused in prison. I therefore accepted the prosecution’s contention that an adverse inference should be drawn against the accused on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In any case, the bank account balances and the text messages mentioned earlier showed that the accused’s claim that he had enough money from May to early August 2011 to splurge on drugs was unbelievable. On his evidence, he collected the $20,000 towards the end of April 2011 and started spending the cash advance as he “gradually” increased his heroin intake. His case was not that he spent the whole amount at once. That being so, he would have several thousand dollars with him at any point in time between May and July 2011, especially in the earlier months, since he claimed he did not deposit the $20,000 in the bank accounts. However, the text messages depicted a person who was constantly scrounging for small loans to tide himself over. In April 2011, his text messages show that he was looking to borrow amounts as small as $30. Even after returning from Malaysia on 27 April, the situation did not change. The only inference was that he received no cash advance at all. The accused explained that he had cultivated a habit of asking for money by cooking up all sorts of reasons even if he had no need to borrow. He claimed that he would not mix money that he set aside for drugs with money for other expenses. These explanations were unbelievable given the urgent and even desperate tone of the messages as well as their content. He was practically begging for small amounts of money despite the alleged cash advance and his professed earnings of about $2,000 a month. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The accused’s case was that he decided to buy the low grade heroin as he thought he could stretch his dollar. The prosecution calculated that the five packets of low grade heroin would last him only 40 to 45 days despite costing about $167 to $188 a day. In contrast, one packet of normal grade heroin could stretch over 36 to 37 days despite costing $143 to $147 a day (at his professed intake of 12g of heroin a day).

</div> The accused argued that such calculations could be derived only with the benefit of hindsight since he had no way of knowing the exact purity of the low grade heroin. However, there was no need for him to resort to detailed calculations to figure out that this could not be a good deal. As he said in court, low grade heroin was unmarketable and termed “barang reject”. To a heroin user, what counts is the purity and not mere bulk quantity. As a seasoned addict, the accused would know that if he switched to heroin that was less pure, he would have to consume a higher amount in order to achieve the satisfaction that he was accustomed to. He would be uncertain about how much longer the five packets of low grade heroin would last him compared to one packet of normal grade heroin. Since the accused claimed that he had the windfall from Malaysia, a fairly good income from his work in Singapore and a reliable source of normal grade heroin, it would be completely against common sense for him to think that he had a “good deal”. The accused has shown in court that he is a fairly intelligent person. He would not have made such a foolish deal, particularly when it required him to buy a packet of normal grade heroin anyway which he then had to sell for a profit of $400 in order to pay for the entire deal, thereby making him a trafficker when, as he claimed, he was merely a heavy consumer.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 If the five packets of heroin were indeed purchased by the accused for his own consumption, why did he not tell the CNB at any point in time? In his CNB statements, the accused maintained that he had no knowledge of the four packets of heroin in the blue plastic bag. At the trial, he claimed to have fabricated material parts of his statements to distance himself from the four packets due to his panic, confusion and drug withdrawal.

</div> He last took heroin at about 7-8pm before his arrest at about 9.45pm on 3 August 2011. He told Dr Winslow that his withdrawal symptoms lasted about five to six days. Under cross-examination, he asserted that his drug withdrawal episode lasted until 9 August. This meant that even if he had suffered from drug withdrawal, the symptoms would have abated by 11 August when the first long statement was taken. Dr Yogaratnam, who examined the accused on 10 August, did not observe any withdrawal symptoms. Dr Winslow also told the court that heroin withdrawal symptoms would peak in the first 72 hours (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, up to 6 August for the accused). While the accused could perhaps claim to be in shock and panic soon after his arrest, that could not be the case later on. The degree of elaboration in the first and the second long statements, whether fabricated or not, reflected a mental state that was far from confused. When the first long statement was recorded, he was even able to indicate in neat handwriting on the maps provided where he usually met Abang, where he collected the drugs on the day of his arrest and where he paid Abang for the packet of normal grade heroin. In the fourth long statement, he was asked specifically if he consumed drugs. Yet his reply was, “I got nothing to say.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I accepted that the accused consumed heroin on a regular basis but it was certainly not at the level alleged by him. As I held above, he did not have the financial means to sustain that level of addiction. As Dr Winslow said, such a consumer would rank in the top 5% of all heroin addicts he had seen and the main barrier was financing. The accused sought to link his consumption level to his withdrawal symptoms, which he claimed were more severe than observed by the doctors who examined him in remand. Even assuming that the doctors had under-rated his symptoms, this did not necessarily mean that he was a heavy abuser of heroin. As Dr Winslow said, even a light user of heroin could experience all kinds of symptoms. The accused further sought to rely on the spike in morphine levels in his urine to support his claim that his heroin consumption had shot up compared to 1999 and 2000 when he was admitted into the DRC. Here again, the medical evidence was that such a correlation was not an easy one to draw. The interval between the last intake of heroin and the taking of the urine sample could affect the morphine level. Indeed, the accused said his last injection of heroin was at about 7-8pm. He was arrested a short while later at about 9.45pm. The accused also did not state in any of his statements that he was such a heavy heroin abuser. The claim that he injected 12g of heroin a day at the time of his arrest came only when he was examined by Dr Kenneth Koh on 22 August 2011 and 25 August 2011.

</div>  He reported the same to Dr Winslow and Dr Lam close to three years after his arrest. While their report concluded that it was “possible” that the accused did use 12g of heroin daily, Dr Winslow testified that he was unable to conclude that the accused indeed consumed 12g a day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Given that the accused was a heroin abuser, it was likely that part of the heroin that was found in the bedroom would have been used for his personal consumption. The question was how and whether such an apportionment could be made. In <span class="font-italic">Fung Choon Kay v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 547, the Court of Appeal held (at [19]) that the burden is on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that part of the heroin should be apportioned for self-consumption. In order to discharge this burden, he had to adduce credible evidence that part of the heroin was intended for his consumption. There also had to be credible evidence on how many days’ worth of the heroin was meant for his personal consumption as well as his consumption rate. Without such credible evidence, any apportionment would be conjectural and arbitrary. The accused’s case was that all five packets of low grade heroin (in the bowl and in the dark blue plastic bag) were for consumption. As I alluded to above, I did not find his case to be credible at all. The accused also claimed that the weighing scale and the empty sachets were for him to regulate his consumption. In my view, on the totality of the evidence, it was clear that they were used by him to repack the drugs for sale. The big packets of heroin had not been repacked by the accused into sachets at the time of his arrest because he had no time to do so. He was arrested within a few hours after collecting his stock from his supplier. The heroin that could fairly be attributed to the accused’s own use was that contained in the two sachets that were kept separately in the hanging compartment of the wardrobe. These two packets formed the subject of the second charge which was stood down (see [2] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the trafficking charge. The accused was unable to rebut the presumption in s 17 of the MDA by proving on a balance of probabilities that he possessed the heroin in the trafficking charge for his consumption. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on the trafficking charge. Upon his conviction on that charge and upon the application of the prosecution, I granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal under s 147 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) for the second, third and fourth charges.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 If the accused could come within the criteria set out in s 33B of the MDA, he would be eligible for alternative sentencing and not have to suffer the death penalty. The facts showed that he was not a mere courier of drugs. He had the intention and the means of repacking the drugs he had obtained from Abang for sale to third parties. He therefore did not come within the ambit of either s 33B(2)(a) or (3)(a). The prosecution informed the court that the Public Prosecutor would not be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(b). Further, the accused did not claim that he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the offence. He therefore could not satisfy the requirement in s 33B(3)(b) as well. As the accused could not meet any of the requirements in s 33B, I had no alternative but to impose the mandatory death penalty on the accused. I did so accordingly. I also ordered the exhibits to be disposed of after any appeal has been dealt with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The accused has appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Tay Yong Kwang</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Kok Weng and Krystle Chiang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br/>Mahendran s/o Mylvaganam and Chitra Balakrishnan (Regency Legal LLP), and Christopher Anand s/o Daniel (Advocatus Law LLP) for the accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
