The underlying disputes concern a joint venture between the parties that ended acrimoniously. In earlier tranches of the SICC proceedings, the respondents in the present appeal had been found to have breached the contract between the parties. The present appeal arose out of the third tranche of proceedings before the SICC, which concerned the assessment of loss and damage. The SICC determined that, notwithstanding the first respondent’s breaches of contract, the appellants had not proved that they were entitled to receive any damages, or other remedy, and if upheld, this would bring this suit to an ultimately unproductive end for the appellants. The present appeal is concerned with this issue only. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Because the litigation to this point has been long-running and somewhat complex, it is useful to first outline the case and its procedural history.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The first appellant, BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd (“BCBCS”), a company incorporated in Singapore, is an associate of the second appellant, Binderless Coal Briquetting Company Pty Limited (“BCBC”), which is a company incorporated in Australia. BCBC is the exclusive licensee of a patented technology capable of processing low-value sub-bituminous coal to yield a higher-value coal suitable for commercial sale. The process, which has given the appellants their names, is known as “Binderless Coal Briquetting” (the “BCB Process”). Both appellants are indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of White Energy Company Limited (“WEC”), an energy and technology company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The first respondent, PT Bayan Resources TBK (“BR”), is a coal mining company listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange; its subsidiaries operate sub-bituminous coal mines in Tabang, Indonesia. The second respondent, Bayan International Pte Ltd (“BI”), is its associate incorporated in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In May 2005, the respondents learnt about the BCB Process and entered into discussions with BCBC regarding a possible joint venture to construct and commission a plant in Tabang (the “Tabang Plant”). It was contemplated that the Tabang Plant would process sub-bituminous coal supplied by BR’s subsidiaries, using the BCB Process to upgrade such coal. The resulting higher-value coal would then be sold at a higher profit. Eventually, a joint venture deed (the “JV Deed”) was executed on 7 June 2006 between BCBC and BI. The corporate vehicle used for the venture was PT Kaltim Supacoal (“KSC”), an Indonesian company in which BCBCS held a 51% stake, and BI held the remaining 49%. In 2008, BI sold its 49% share to BR, and, in 2009, by a deed of novation, BCBC and BI were replaced by BCBCS and BR as the parties to the JV Deed. This had the effect of aligning the named parties to the JV Deed and the shareholders of KSC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the meantime, the construction of the Tabang Plant had commenced. However, the venture ran into issues that increased its cost. To sustain KSC and the joint venture, BCBCS and BR entered into three sets of agreements at various times between April 2007 and December 2010 to extend loans to KSC. These agreements, especially those relating to BR’s loans to KSC, are central to this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The first two sets were shareholder loan agreements that KSC entered into with BCBCS and BR separately. We will refer to the loan agreements between BCBCS and KSC as the “1SLA (BCBCS)”

</div> In response, the respondents brought a counterclaim. In 2015, the suit was transferred to the SICC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The issues of liability were determined in two tranches before the SICC. The first tranche was heard in November 2015 and January 2016. Judgment was handed down on 12 May 2016 in <span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1 (the “<span class="font-italic">First Tranche Judgment</span>”). No appeal was brought against this judgment. In January and April 2017, the second tranche of trial was conducted. On 26 July 2017, the SICC handed down its decision in <span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another</span> [2017] 5 SLR 77 (the “<span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span>”). The respondents appealed the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span>, but that appeal was dismissed wholly by this court on 29 August 2018 in <span class="font-italic">PT Bayan Resources TBK and another v BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another</span> [2019] 1 SLR 30 (the “<span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span>”). However, in the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span>, this court also held that the SICC should have determined an issue which it did not in the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span>. The matter was thus remitted to the SICC to resolve that issue. The SICC heard evidence on the remitted issue in October and November 2018. On 9 January 2019, it handed down its decision in <span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK and another </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1 (the “<span class="font-italic">Remittal Judgment</span>”). The <span class="font-italic">Remittal Judgment</span> was appealed but that was dismissed without written grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In essence, the SICC found, and this court upheld, that BR had by various means breached its obligation to supply sub-bituminous coal to KSC, this being a condition of the JV Deed (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [136]–[144] and [182]; the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> at [74]–[82] and [103]–[113]). The respondents’ counterclaim was also dismissed, and it was held that BCBCS had not breached the JV Deed (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [147]–[177]; the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> at [119]–[156]). BR therefore had no lawful basis upon which to terminate the JV Deed on 21 February 2012 and its purported termination was wrongful (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [193]; the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> at [157]). It followed that BR’s letter dated 21 February 2012 operated as a repudiation of the JV Deed, and, by its 2 March 2012 letter, BCBCS validly accepted BR’s repudiation, thereby bringing the venture to an end on that date (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [195]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On the footing that BR had breached its obligation to supply coal to KSC under the JV Deed (referred to as the “coal supply obligations” in the earlier judgments), the matter proceeded to a third tranche of trial for the SICC to assess the losses suffered by the appellants as a consequence of such breach. The appellants sought to recover damages under two heads. The first was for wasted expenditure of around US$91 million comprising the various loans which they had extended to KSC in connection with the venture (the “First Head of Loss”). The essence of the appellants’ claim was that they would have recouped these loans had BR not breached and wrongfully terminated the JV Deed. The second head was for the chance they lost to increase the production capacity of the Tabang Plant to three times its nameplate capacity and, consequently, to profit therefrom (the “Second Head of Loss”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As stated at the outset, the SICC ruled against the appellants. In respect of the First Head of Loss, the SICC made various findings and concluded that even if BR had not acted in breach of its coal supply obligations, the appellants would not have been able to recoup their wasted expenditure (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [194]–[195]). Three findings were crucial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 First, the SICC held that the BCB Process “would have worked”, that the Tabang Plant would have achieved its nameplate capacity of one million metric tonnes per annum (“MTPA”) by June 2012 at the very latest (we refer to this as “commercial production”), and that the upgraded coal briquettes would have been saleable (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [144]). However, notwithstanding this finding, the SICC found that KSC would not, in any case have been able to generate a positive cash flow until 2028, and, therefore, would not have been able to begin repaying any of the loans due, whether to BCBCS or BR, until such time. Indeed, the fact that KSC would not have had a positive cash flow until 2028 was not even in dispute, having been accepted by the appellants’ own quantum expert, Mr James Nicholson (“Mr Nicholson”). Mr Nicholson’s own calculations showed that the interest due on the three loans would only have been paid from 2028 onwards, and KSC would only have been able to repay the principal sum due under the PLFA (which was prioritised by the Subordination Letter) starting from 2037. On this footing, Mr Nicholson’s conclusion was that BCBCS would only have been able to recoup its wasted expenditure (this being the First Head of Loss) in 2043 (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [147]).

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Second, as KSC would not have been able to repay the loans it took from either BCBCS or BR, the SICC accepted the respondents’ claim (as described in the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [145]) that BR would have brought the joint venture to an end by winding up KSC before 2028. This was a step which BR would have been legally entitled to take as an unpaid creditor under the 1SLA (BR), 2SLA (BR) or PLFA (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment </span>at [149]). The winding up of KSC would inevitably have prevented the appellants from recouping their expenditure through the anticipated operations of KSC (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [154]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Third, the SICC determined in the alternative that, even if the appellants’ claim was assessed on the footing that KSC would not have been wound up by BR ahead of 2028, the terms of the JV Deed read with the connected coal supply agreements only obliged BR (through its subsidiaries) to supply KSC with sub-bituminous coal until 7 April 2028, which was when all their mining concessions would have expired. Given that KSC would still not be profitable at this time, BR could have reasonably formed the view that the joint venture would take too long to turn a profit, and BR could also have reasonably decided not to renew its subsidiaries’ mining concessions without acting in breach of the JV Deed. Accordingly, it could be taken that, by 7 April 2028, the supply of sub-bituminous coal to KSC could and would have ceased in any event (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [157]–[160]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On this basis, even if KSC’s business had continued, in order for the appellants to prove that they would have recovered their wasted expenditure had BR not acted in breach of its coal supply obligations, they needed to show that such expenditure would have been recovered by April 2028. Absent a supply of coal from April 2028 onwards, such recoupment would not have been possible in any event. Following a detailed analysis of various matters which bore on the quantification of KSC’s potential earnings from June 2012 (when the Tabang Plant would have reached its nameplate capacity of one MTPA) until April 2028, the SICC found that the appellants would not have been able to recoup their wasted expenditure <span class="font-italic">even if</span> KSC had not been wound up by BR before then (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [155], [161]–[191] and [194]–[195]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In respect of the Second Head of Loss, the SICC’s dispositive finding was that the appellants’ claim for damages resulting from their alleged “loss of chance” was not compensable because there was nothing in the JV Deed which obliged BR to expand the production capacity of the Tabang Plant from one MTPA to three MTPA. As a loss of chance claim requires, at the very least, the appellants to show that BR was obliged under the JV Deed to proceed with such expansion (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Tembusu Growth Fund Ltd v ACTAtek, Inc and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1213 at [123]), their claim necessarily failed in the absence of such an obligation (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [196]–[199]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The SICC also justified its conclusion in respect of this head of loss on several alternative bases. First, it held that the loss of chance doctrine only applies in situations where the chance to acquire the benefit which had allegedly been lost is dependent on the actions of a third party. The doctrine does not apply in cases like the present, where the chance alleged to have been lost was dependent on the defendant’s own actions (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [200]–[207]). Second, given the breakdown of BCBCS and BR’s working relationship, there did not exist a real and substantial chance that BR would have separately agreed to increase the Tabang Plant’s production capacity to three MTPA (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [210]–[213]). Lastly, the evidence did not support a finding that the requisite funding could have been secured to perform the works needed to expand the Tabang Plant’s production capacity to three MTPA (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [214]–[219]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The grounds of appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The appellants appeal the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>but before us, they have abandoned their claim for the Second Head of Loss and their appeal therefore focuses only on the First Head of Loss. In this connection, the appellants raise two grounds of appeal.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As to the first ground of appeal, there are several points the appellants take. First, they contend that the SICC erred in finding that BR <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">ould</span> have taken steps to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor. Second, and in any case, they contend the SICC erred in finding that BR <span class="font-italic">would have been able</span> to wind up KSC. There were, according to the appellants, both factual and legal barriers which would have prevented BR from unilaterally winding up KSC as an unpaid creditor. Third, they contend that, even if BR was inclined to take steps to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor, doing so <span class="font-italic">would have put BR in breach of obligations</span><span class="font-italic"> it owed under the JV Deed</span>. It appears to be the appellants’ case, as we outline later, that BR would not be allowed to avoid liability for damages on this basis since this would entail BR benefitting from its own wrongful conduct. The appellants advance five alternative arguments in support of these contentions.

</div> – would have gifted the required funds to KSC to repay the sums due to BR. KSC would therefore have been shielded from falling into default, and BR would not have become entitled to wind up KSC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, in any case, BR would not have succeeded in winding up KSC because of the Subordination Letter. Even if it is not accepted that the appellants would have gift-funded KSC beyond the US$20 million accepted by the SICC, the obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR) would not have entitled BR to wind up KSC. This is because the Subordination Letter had the effect of deferring KSC’s obligation to repay BR under these two shareholder loans until such time as KSC had fully repaid the sums owing under the PLFA (meaning the sums drawn down on the Priority Facility as well as the balance owing for the Coal Advance). Put another way, the Subordination Letter rendered the full payment of the PLFA a <span class="font-italic">condition</span><span class="font-italic"> precedent</span> to the accrual of KSC’s payment obligations under the shareholder loans. Further, Art 9.2 of the PLFA provided that KSC’s obligation to settle the debts it owed under the PLFA could only be triggered by a <span class="font-italic">joint</span> written demand issued by both BCBCS and BR.

</div> Thus, in summary, there were two related impediments in the way of BR enforcing KSC’s payment obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR). First, KSC’s payment obligations thereunder would not arise until the PLFA was fully repaid and, second, KSC’s payment obligations under the PLFA could only be triggered with BCBCS’s consent, which would not have been forthcoming.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, even if BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor and this court does not accept that BR would have been prevented from achieving its ends by either the appellants’ gift-funding or by the Subordination Letter, BR’s attempt would nonetheless not have been legally effective because this would have caused KSC’s business to cease, contrary to cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed which provides that the consent of both BCBCS and BR would be required to cease KSC’s business. In short, the appellants contend that cl 7.1(x) deprived BR of the legal power to wind up KSC unilaterally.

</div> Although the appellants do not expressly state in their written case what the import of such breaches would be, it seems to us that they seek to rely on the principle that a contracting party will not generally be entitled to take advantage of his own breach of contract as against the other party (see, for instance, <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2021) at para 15-113).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The second ground of appeal concerns the SICC’s alternative finding that, even if BR did not take steps to wind up KSC, the appellants would nonetheless not have been able to recover their wasted expenditure (see [19]–[20] above). In essence, they contend that the SICC erred in reaching certain findings which reduced the appellants’ notional ability to recoup their wasted expenditure in the event that BR did not wind up KSC. For example, the SICC did not accept the historical and forecasted coal prices suggested by the appellants’ industry expert, Mr Lloyd Hain, which were higher than those put forth by Mr Peter Ball, the respondents’ expert. Lower prices naturally affected the appellants’ claim that they would have been able to recoup their expenditure (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [166]–[177]).

On appeal, the appellants argue that BR’s coal supply obligations extended beyond April 2028, and, therefore, the appellants would have had a longer period over which to recoup their dues through KSC’s business operations.

In all fairness, however, we think it may be putting it somewhat higher than warranted to say, as the SICC did, that the respondents had “squarely indicated” in their pleadings that BR would have specifically taken steps to wind up KSC on the basis that KSC would have defaulted on the various loans due to be repaid to BR (see the <span class="font-italic">Judgment</span> at [150]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The respondents’ pleaded position on this issue is not of the highest quality.

Equally, they also did not put to the respondents’ witnesses that it would have been “uncommercial” for BR to wind up KSC, a finding of fact which the SICC was not invited to make.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 While we do not think the respondents’ pleading was a model of clarity, we disagree with the appellants that the respondents should not now be allowed to take the point that BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC upon it defaulting on the payments due under the various loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that Mr Taylor’s report and the respondents’ opening statement at trial, coupled with the appellants’ failure to take a more substantive objection, were enough to put the point in issue. Thus, the SICC did not err in considering the respondents’ defence on its merits, nor did it err in determining the ultimate issue – that is, whether BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC – in the respondents’ favour. In our judgment, the SICC was correct to find against the appellants on this issue, and we agree with this conclusion for three essential reasons. First, as noted in the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> at [9]–[33], the relationship between the parties deteriorated from November 2011 and had basically broken down by February 2012 when BR issued its letter of termination (also see [12] above). In the face of this finding – which remains undisturbed before us – it is artificial to suggest that BR would nonetheless have held out for the <span class="font-italic">many </span><span class="font-italic">years</span> that would have been necessary for the appellants to have some chance to recover the money that had been loaned to KSC. As stated above, even on Mr Nicholson’s calculations, the appellants would only have started seeing any payments from 2028 and, even then, only of interest, and not yet of the principal sums of the loans (see [17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, against this backdrop, we do not accept that there was no evidence to support the respondents’ claim that BR would have wound up KSC as an unpaid creditor. At the 2 November 2011 meeting, the respondents made clear that they wished to bring the joint venture to an end (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [24]), and, although BR chiefly proposed that this end be brought about by BCBCS buying over BR’s 49% interest in KSC, at a further meeting on 6 December 2011, BR also made clear that unless BCBCS had an acceptable counter-proposal, KSC would have to be liquidated (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Judgment</span> at [50(f)]; the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> at [23]). That this discussion did not concern BR winding up KSC as an unpaid creditor is beside the point. Given the state of the parties’ relationship, coupled with the fact that the liquidation of KSC was envisioned, it is more probable than not that BR would have used the means available to it, to achieve its desired objective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As regards the appellants’ contention that winding up KSC would have been uncommercial, we do not agree that this tilts the balance back in the appellants’ favour. To the appellants, it might have been sensible to keep the venture going, but it would not have been unreasonable for BR to have taken the view that it was better off cutting its losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, it seems to us that the appellants also realised that they probably could not effectively dispute that BR <span class="font-italic">would have</span> taken steps to wind up KSC. In their closing submissions at trial, they began with a brief assertion that the respondents’ Winding Up Defence was unpleaded and without factual basis.

In respect of the latter, however, the respondents call to attention that the appellants’ evidence was that the US$20 million to be gifted to KSC was to fund its “operating costs”; the appellants’ evidence <span class="font-italic">was not</span> that such funds would have been gifted to KSC for the purposes of repaying its loans under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR).

</div> We disagree. That the appellants would have gifted US$20 million to sustain KSC’s cash needs until June 2012 is one matter. To say that they would have provided up to <span class="font-italic">US$</span><span class="font-italic">56.4 million</span> is quite another. The principal difficulty here is that there must, at the very least, be evidence that the appellants would have specifically provided the required sum to KSC, and, further, some explanation for why sinking up to US$56.4 million into the venture in these circumstances would have been a sensible commercial decision. Such explanation would also need to account for the appellants’ poor relationship with the respondents and, consequently, the risk of BR breaching and wrongfully terminating the JV Deed, particularly given that BR’s supply of coal to KSC was essential to its very viability as a business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 No such evidence or explanation was placed before the SICC and none is before us.

The Subordination Letter merely set out, in rather general terms, the order in which BCBCS and BR agreed KSC would repay the various loans made.

To read into the terms of the Subordination Letter such an effect would, in our view, stretch its language too far.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In particular, the contextual points raised by the appellants need to be addressed. The appellants submit that during the negotiations leading to the PLFA and Subordination Letter (which, as stated at [11] above, were signed on the same day), the parties anticipated that KSC would not have been able to pay off its debts under the PLFA by 31 December 2011 (the original repayment date before it was extended to 30 June 2012), let alone the aggregate due under the PLFA <span class="font-italic">and</span> the shareholder loans that were due thereafter. This, the appellants say, led to the inclusion of Art 9.3 of the PLFA which provided that, if KSC “does not have the requisite funds available to repay BCBCS and BR in full, [KSC], BCBCS and BR will agree an alternative repayment schedule”.

</div> By this, the appellants submit that the parties were required to agree to the postponement of KSC’s repayment obligations under the PLFA. This, it is said, supports the conclusion that the parties agreed by way of the Subordination Letter to suspend KSC’s repayment obligations under the shareholder loans until the PLFA had been fully repaid. If the Subordination Letter did not have such effect, and KSC’s obligations to repay the shareholder loans would have fallen due irrespective of whether the PLFA had been fully paid, the parties’ obligation to agree to an alternative repayment schedule for the sums due under the PLFA would be rendered wholly otiose.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We do not agree for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, if the parties in fact anticipated that KSC would not have been able to make payment on the PLFA by 31 December 2011, it makes no sense that they nonetheless agreed that KSC’s payment obligations would accrue on that date. They would, logically, have instead agreed that KSC would be obliged to make payment in accordance with the schedule to be agreed under Art 9.3, and, in the absence of such agreement, on some fixed date later than 31 December 2011. Yet, this is not what the PLFA provided. Article 9.1 of the PLFA unambiguously stated that KSC was obliged to pay BCBCS and BR on the “Repayment Date”, meaning<span class="font-italic"> </span>31 December 2011 “unless extended”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-f4458f56-2dd0-47a5-ae7d-8bdcaf849d6d" data-toggle="modal" type="button">67</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, although Art 9.3 of the PLFA obliges the parties to agree an alternative repayment schedule in the event KSC is unable to make full repayment, that does not do away with KSC’s clear obligation to repay BCBCS and BR on the date referenced in Art 9.1. If no alternative schedule is agreed under Art 9.3, KSC’s obligation under Art 9.1 stands, and, at most, the question would arise as to whether either party wrongfully obstructed an alternative schedule from being agreed under Art 9.3. If, for example, BR had wrongfully prevented an alternative repayment schedule from being agreed, that might constitute a separate breach of contract, but that cannot have the effect of displacing the obligation to repay BCBCS and BR on the date referred to in Art 9.1. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, in this light, the fact that Art 9.3 was included in the PLFA is not determinative in so far as we are concerned with the effect of the Subordination Letter. Whether KSC was able to make payment or not, its obligation to repay the sums it owed under the PLFA simply fell due in accordance with Art 9.1 unless such due date was extended under Art 11.1 (see [9] above), or unless an alternative repayment schedule was agreed under Art 9.3. If the Subordination Letter was intended to effect the significant changes to KSC’s payment obligations suggested by the appellants, the terms of the letter could, should and would have been drafted more clearly. That they were not indicates to us that the parties did not <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> intend for the letter to have such effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, we accept that the precise effect of the Subordination Letter remains somewhat obscure. While the language and context of the Subordination Letter do not support the conclusion that the parties intended that the repayment dates earlier agreed upon would be affected or varied in the way suggested by the appellants, it is not entirely satisfactory to suggest that the Subordination Letter did <span class="font-italic">nothing</span> to vary the parties’ legal positions. Neither the appellants nor respondents were able to satisfactorily account for the terms of the Subordination Letter in the light of the surrounding facts. While we were clear that the appellants’ contention (that KSC’s payment obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR) had been deferred indefinitely until the PLFA had been repaid) was not correct for the reasons set out at [49]–[51] above, we think the best sense we can make of it is that the Subordination Letter was concerned with rearranging the sequence in which payments would be made if and to the extent the outstanding amounts under the PLFA’s Priority Facility and the Coal Advance were going to be repaid when due, subject to any agreed extensions. Once that date had passed, there could be no logical basis for further deferring KSC’s payment obligations under the other loan agreements. As at the date of the termination, the sums outstanding under the PLFA’s Priority Facility, and the Coal Advance were due for payment a few months later, on 30 June 2012 and there is no question that KSC would not have been able to make those payments on that date. Absent evidence that the date for repayment would have been further extended, we can see no basis for holding that BR could not have enforced KSC’s other debts when they fell due.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed preclude BR from winding up KSC?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Clause 7.1(x) of the JV Deed provides as follows:

We also highlight cl 11 of the JV Deed, which provided a mechanism to break deadlocks. The latter is significant because this was the agreed mechanism that would apply if the parties disagreed on whether KSC should stop its business, instead of either party acting unilaterally to force this outcome by starving KSC of funding. It is significant that the definition of ‘deadlock’ under the JV Deed contemplated impasses on any of the matters under cl 7.1, including the cessation of the business.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77 The foregoing <span class="font-italic">undercuts </span><span class="font-italic">[BR’s] position that [it was] able to unilaterally bring about the cessation of KSC’s operations and business simply by withholding consent to provide further funding</span>.

The appellants have taken these two paragraphs of the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment</span> out of context. The question with which we were concerned there was whether BR remained obliged to supply coal to KSC after 15 December 2011 given that the Tabang Plant had been placed into care and maintenance and was not in operation. The respondents’ position was that BR’s coal supply obligations had ceased because cl 3.8(b)(iii) of the JV Deed only obliged it to supply coal “for the operation of the Business”.

</div> Against this, the appellants submitted that KSC’s “business” was still in operation because cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed required both BCBCS’s and BR’s consent to cease KSC’s business, and such consent had not been obtained. The respondents countered that cl 7.1(x) was irrelevant because the parties could not sensibly have intended such a formalistic operation of the terms. As there was no dispute that KSC required further funding in order to restart its operations, and that BR had withheld its consent to provide the necessary further funding, the respondents contended – as a matter of fact – that KSC’s operations and business had ceased, which, in turn, obviated BR’s coal supply obligations. We rejected the respondents’ contentions, taking the view that BR could not unilaterally have brought about the cessation of KSC’s business by its own decision to withhold funding (see the <span class="font-italic">Second Tranche Appeal Judgment </span>at [77]). Put simply, we held BR to the formality imposed by cl 7.1(x). This reasoning, which concerned the performance of various duties under the joint venture, is of no relevance here where we are concerned with each party’s separate and individual right to enforce a debt. We therefore find, for the reasons given at [54] above, that cl 7.1(x) does not support the appellants’ first ground of appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An ancillary issue arising from cl 8.2 of the JV Deed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 While we did not accept the appellants’ arguments premised on cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed, their reference to cl 8 (see [55] above), however, does raise a potentially salient question relevant to whether BR would have been able to wind up KSC.

In the alternative, the appellants also contend that, notwithstanding any inadequacy of the pleadings, the question of whether cll 17.1 and 17.3 had been breached was “specifically ventilated” at the third tranche of trial.

Indeed, it is apparent that the appellants appreciated that the matter was in issue because, as stated at [46] above, they led evidence specifically in support of their position that they would have covered KSC’s obligation to pay BR for the Coal Advance and raised various arguments to refute the Winding Up Defence. However, there was little or no exploration of cll 17.1 and 17.3 at the third tranche of trial. The appellants only point us to scant mentions of the point before the SICC.

It should not be surprising that determining whether there have been breaches of one’s contractual obligations to use all reasonable endeavours, to co-operate, to act in good faith, or not to act in breach of trust and confidence, are intensely fact-sensitive inquiries. They depend not only on the character of the contract in question but also on the circumstances of the parties’ interactions, the stage at which the contract is, and, of course, the particular act or course of conduct which is said to result in a breach (see, for instance, the recent decision of the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ng Koon Yee Mickey v Mah Sau Cheong</span> [2022] SGHC(A) 33 at [105]–[133] which concerned a duty to co-operate). Having decided that they would rely on cll 17.1 and 17.3 (as evident from their closing submissions at trial), the appellants ought to have approached the third tranche of trial with a view to securing the factual premises necessary to establish breaches of cll 17.1 and 17.3.

The second appellant (“<span class="font-weight-bold">BCBC</span>”), a company incorporated in Australia, is the exclusive licensee of a patented technology capable of upgrading low-value sub-bituminous coal to a higher-value coal suitable for commercial sale. The process is known as the “BCB Process”. Both appellants are indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries of White Energy Company Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">WEC</span>”), an energy and technology company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The first respondent (“<span class="font-weight-bold">BR</span>”) is a coal mining company listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The subsidiaries of BR operate sub-bituminous coal mines in Tabang, Indonesia. The second respondent (“<span class="font-weight-bold">BI</span>”) is BR’s associate incorporated in Singapore.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 In June 2006, BCBC and BI entered into a joint venture by the execution of a deed (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">JV</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Deed</span>”). The purpose of the venture was to set up a plant in Tabang, Indonesia (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Tabang</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Plant</span>”) to use the BCB Process and upgrade sub-bituminous coal which was to be supplied by BR’s subsidiaries. The vehicle used for the joint venture was PT Kaltim Supacoal (“<span class="font-weight-bold">KSC</span>”), an Indonesian company in which BCBCS initially held a 51% stake and BI held the other 49%. Ultimately, in 2008 and 2009, through the sale of KSC’s shares and a deed of novation, the named parties to the JV Deed and the shareholders of KSC were aligned as BCBCS and BR. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Meanwhile, the construction of the Tabang Plant commenced. However, issues arose which resulted in increased costs. Thus, to sustain KSC as well as the joint venture, BCBCS and BR entered into three sets of agreements between April 2007 and December 2010 to extend loans to KSC.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The first two sets were shareholder loan agreements by which BCBCS and BR each agreed to make substantial loan facilities available to KSC. Following various addenda, the total sum which BCBCS agreed to make available to KSC under its shareholder loans (respectively, abbreviated as “<span class="font-weight-bold">1SLA (BCBCS)</span>” and “<span class="font-weight-bold">2SLA (BCBCS)</span>”) was US$60m. The total sum which BR made available to KSC under its shareholder loans (respectively, the “<span class="font-weight-bold">1SLA (BR)</span>” and “<span class="font-weight-bold">2SLA (BR)</span>”) was US$50m.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The third agreement, called the “priority loan funding agreement” (“<span class="font-weight-bold">PLFA</span>”), was executed by BCBCS, BR and KSC. By this, BCBCS undertook to make available another loan facility which would ultimately be for US$40m (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Priority Facility</span>”). BR, rather than lending money directly to KSC, undertook to supply sub-bituminous coal to KSC (through its subsidiaries) at a rate below the market price. KSC was then obliged to pay BR the balance later. In essence, BR undertook to supply coal to KSC under a partial deferred payment scheme (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Coal</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Advance</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR) respectively, BR advanced US$25m and around US$14.6m to KSC. Pursuant to the Coal Advance, BR effectively provided US$4.19m in funding to KSC through the deferred payments.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Each of these loan agreements had distinct repayment schedules. Based on the terms of the three sets of agreements, the chronological order in which KSC was to settle its debts with BCBCS and BR was as follows:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. By 31 December 2011, KSC was to repay BCBCS the sums it borrowed under the 2SLA (BCBCS);</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. By 30 June 2012, KSC was to repay BCBCS the sums it borrowed under the PLFA’s Priority Facility and pay BR the balance it owed for the Coal Advance;</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. By 31 December 2012, KSC was to repay BR the sums it borrowed under the 2SLA (BR); and</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. On 30 June 2013, KSC was to start making annual repayments under both the 1SLA (BCBCS) and 1SLA (BR) and these annual repayments needed to be completed by 30 June 2017.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The appellants suggested, however, that this schedule had been varied. On 17 December 2010, BCBCS, BR and KSC agreed by a letter called the “Subordination Letter” to vary the order in which KSC was to settle these debts. In essence, this letter provided that KSC was to repay the debts it owed under the PLFA “first, ahead of all other [loan agreements]”. Thereafter, KSC was then to repay the 1SLA (BCBCS) and 1SLA (BR) (both ranking equally), and, finally, the 2SLA (BCBCS) and 2SLA (BR) (both also ranking equally). The effect of this letter was an important aspect of the appellants’ case on appeal.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 These loans, however, did not save the joint venture. Following various delays and costs overruns, the relationship between BCBCS and BR eventually soured, and, on 21 February 2012, BR purported to terminate the JV Deed. On 2 March 2012, BCBCS responded, stating that BR did not have grounds to terminate, and that it would thus treat and accept BR’s 2 February 2012 communication as a repudiation of the JV Deed. At about this time, the appellants commenced proceedings against the respondents in the High Court and the respondents counterclaimed. The matter was later transferred to the SICC in 2015 which determined the issues relating to the parties’ liability in two earlier tranches.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 In those two tranches, it was essentially found that BR had by various means breached its obligation to supply sub-bituminous coal to KSC (the “coal supply obligations”), this being a condition of the JV Deed. The respondents’ counterclaim was also dismissed, and it was held that BCBCS had not breached the JV Deed. BR therefore had no lawful basis upon which to terminate the JV Deed on 21 February 2012 and its purported termination was thus wrongful. BCBCS validly accepted BR’s wrongful repudiation on 2 March 2012 and the joint venture thus ended on this date.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 On the footing that BR had breached its coal supply obligations under the JV Deed, the parties’ dispute went before the SICC for a third tranche to assess the losses suffered by the appellants. Before the SICC, the appellants sought to recover damages under two heads but only one remained in issue on appeal before the Court. That is, a claim for wasted expenditure of around US$91m comprising the various loans which had been extended to KSC under the 1SLA (BCBCS), 2SLA (BCBCS) and PLFA. The essence of the appellants’ claim was that they would have recouped these loans had BR not breached and wrongfully repudiated the JV Deed.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The SICC made various findings and concluded that even if BR had not acted in breach of its coal supply obligations, the appellants would not have been able to recoup their wasted expenditure. Two findings were dispositive.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, KSC would not have been able to generate a positive cash flow until 2028, and, therefore, would not have been able to begin repaying any of the loans due, whether to BCBCS or BR, until such time. This was not disputed by the appellants’ quantum expert, Mr James Nicholson (“Mr Nicholson”), who gave evidence that KSC would only have been able to start repaying the principal sum due under the PLFA (which was prioritised by the Subordination Letter) starting from 2037. Mr Nicholson’s also gave evidence that BCBCS would only have been able to recoup its wasted expenditure in 2043.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Second, as KSC would not have been able to repay the loans it took from either BCBCS or BR, the SICC accepted the respondents’ claim that BR would have brought the joint venture to an end by winding up KSC sometime before 2028. This was a step which BR would have been legally entitled to take as an unpaid creditor. The winding up of KSC would, consequently, have prevented the appellants from recouping their around-US$91m in expenditure through the anticipated operations of KSC.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The SICC’s reached the same conclusion on an alternative basis but consideration of this basis on appeal was not required if the appellants failed to challenge the SICC’s dispositive findings.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The appellants’ arguments against the SICC’s dispositive findings</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The appellants raised several arguments.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 First, they submitted that the SICC erred in finding that BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor. On the appellants’ case, this assertion was: (a) not pleaded, (b) only raised at the doorstep of the third tranche of the trial thus indicating that it was an afterthought, and (c) in any case, not substantiated by the facts (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Argument</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 1</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Second, and in any case, the SICC erred in finding that BR would have been able to wind up KSC. There were, according to the appellants, both factual and legal barriers which would have prevented BR from unilaterally winding up KSC as an unpaid creditor. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. As regards factual barriers, the appellants relied on: (i) evidence raised at trial that they would have gift-funded KSC to the tune of US$4.19m in order to help it settle its debt to BR for the Coal Advance, as well as (ii) the finding of the SICC that BCBCS would have provided an additional US$20m to KSC to meet its cash needs until June 2012. On these bases, the appellants argued that they, backed by their parent company, WEC, would have gifted whatever funds needed by KSC to repay BR (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Argument</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 2</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. In respect of legal barriers, the appellants had two points:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">i. The Subordination Letter had rendered the full payment of the PLFA a condition precedent to the accrual of KSC’s payment obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR). Further, a term of the PLFA provided that KSC’s obligation to settle the debts it owed under the PLFA could only be triggered by a joint written demand issued by both BCBCS and BR, a demand which BCBCS would not have agreed to issue. Thus, there were two related impediments in the way of BR enforcing KSC’s payment obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR). One, KSC’s payment obligations thereunder would not arise until the PLFA was fully repaid and, two, KSC’s payment obligations under the PLFA could only be triggered with BCBCS’s consent, which BCBCS would not have given (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Argument</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 3</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">ii. Next, an attempt by BR to wind up KSC unilaterally as an unpaid creditor would not have been legally effective because this would have caused KSC’s business to cease. This would have been contrary to cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed which provided that the consent of both BCBCS and BR was required to cease KSC’s business (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Argument</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 4</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Third, even if BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor and would not have been prevented by any of the aforementioned barriers from doing so effectively, taking such steps would nevertheless have entailed BR acting in breach of: (a) its duty under the JV Deed to use all reasonable endeavours to promote KSC’s business (cl 17.1 of the JV Deed), and (b) its duty to perform the JV Deed in a spirit of mutual co-operation, good faith, trust and confidence (cl 17.3 of the JV Deed). In raising this argument, the appellants impliedly relied on the principle that a contracting party would not generally be entitled to take advantage of its own breach of contract as against its counterparty (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Argument</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 5</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Court’s decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Argument 1</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 In respect of Argument 1, the Court disagreed with the appellants that the respondents had failed to put in issue the question of whether BR would have wound up KSC as an unpaid creditor. And, when considered on the merits, the balance of probabilities favoured the view that BR would at least have attempted to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[43]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 This conclusion was supported by three particular reasons:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. First, the parties’ relationship had deteriorated by February 2012 and it was artificial to suggest that BR would nonetheless have held out for the many years that would have been necessary for the appellants to have had some chance to recover the money that had been loaned to KSC: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[38]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. Second, there was evidence that the issue of KSC’s liquidation had been raised by BR during the subsistence of the joint venture. Although BR did not suggest that it would wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor, that was beside the point. Given the state of the parties’ relationship, it was more likely than not that BR would have used the means available to it to bring the joint venture to an end. Indeed, even if BR would also have suffered losses, it was not unreasonable for it to take the view that it was better off cutting its losses: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[39]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[40]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. Third, the appellants seemed themselves to realise that they probably could not effectively dispute that BR would have taken steps to wind up KSC. Before the SICC, the appellants only faintly objected to the way the respondents raised the defence that BR would have wound up KSC. They primarily sought to refute the defence based on Arguments 2, 3 and 5 above, and offered no serious opposition to the respondents’ claim that BR was ready, willing and going to at least try to end the joint venture: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[41]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Argument 2</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The Court rejected Argument 2 on the basis that, although the appellants could have done so at trial, they failed to adduce sufficient evidence to show that they (and WEC) would have gift-funded KSC the full sums needed to settle KSC’s debts to BR in order to protect KSC from falling into default of its payment obligations under the 1SLA (BR) and 2SLA (BR): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[44]–[48]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Argument 3</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The Court rejected Argument 3 on the basis that neither the text of the Subordination Letter nor the context in which it was prepared suggested with sufficient clarity that the parties objectively intended for KSC’s full repayment of the PLFA to operate as a condition precedent to KSC’s obligation to repay the shareholder loans made by both BCBCS and BR. Although rejecting this argument left the precise effect of the Subordination Letter somewhat obscure, it was clear that the appellants’ argument as to the letter’s effect was not correct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[49]–[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">52]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Argument 4</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The Court held that cl 7.1(x) of the JV Deed did not answer the respondents’ claim that BR would have been able to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor. This was because the text and contents of cl 7.1 showed that the provision concerned the decision-making of KSC internally, with BCBCS and BR acting either in their capacity as members of KSC or through the directors they each nominated to the board of KSC. It did not affect BR’s external right to wind up KSC as an unpaid creditor: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Argument 5</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 Finally, the appellants’ reliance on cll 17.1 and 17.3 of the JV Deed was also rejected. The Court observed that whether a contractual party could be said to have breached its obligations to use all reasonable endeavours, to co-operate, to act in good faith, or not to act in breach of trust and confidence, were intensely fact-sensitive inquiries. However, despite deciding that they would rely on these clauses at the third tranche of trial, the appellants made little to no effort to explore the relevant factual issues before the SICC. As such, there was insufficient evidence for the appellants to establish breaches of cll 17.1 or 17.3 on BR’s part, and it was too late for them to rely on these clauses as they did on appeal: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]–[64]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 As none of the appellants’ arguments against the SICC’s dispositive findings were accepted, the appeal was dismissed. Nevertheless, in recognition of the appellants’ success at the first and second tranches of trial in establishing BR’s liability for breaching the JV Deed, the Court awarded the appellants S$1,000 in nominal damages. As regards costs, the Court directed the parties to make submissions in respect of the costs of the appeal, but expressly made no order or observations in respect of trial costs: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[66] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [67]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
