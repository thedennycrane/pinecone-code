        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This judgment on costs arises in connection with
                    two related appeals, <em>viz</em>, Civil Appeal No 19
                    of 2009 (“CA 19/2009”) and Civil Appeal No 90 of 2009
                    (“CA 90/2009”). CA 19/2009 was an appeal against the
                    decision of the High Court judge in Originating Summons No 1044 of 2008
                    (“OS 1044/2008”) and CA 90/2009 was an appeal against the
                    decision of a second High Court judge in Originating Summons No 800 of 2009
                    (“OS 800/2009”). For convenience, the two High Court judges
                    concerned will, in this Judgment, be referred to, respectively, as “the
                    OS 1044/2008 Judge” and “the OS 800/2009 Judge”.
                    On 6 August 2009, we released our decision (“the 6 August
                    Decision”) and brief grounds for that decision (see <em>DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] SGCA 39 (“the Brief
                    Grounds”)) for both CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009. In the 6 August
                    Decision, we decided in favour of DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd
                    (“DB Trustees”), the appellant in CA 19/2009 and the
                    main respondent in CA 90/2009, for both CA 19/2009 and
                    CA 90/2009, and awarded costs on an indemnity basis to DB Trustees for both
                    appeals and both sets of proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Before the order of court was extracted, counsel
                    for DB Trustees, Mr Sarjit Singh Gill SC
                    (“Mr Singh”), submitted, by way of a letter dated
                    6 August 2009, that Ms Florence Koh Lee Kheng
                    (“Ms Koh”) should be made personally liable for the costs of
                    both appeals. This judgment contains our decision on whether Ms Koh should
                    be made liable for the costs of the appeals and the full reasons for our
                    decision. This judgment is, of course, to be read together with the
                    6 August Decision and the Brief Grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The underlying proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Brief Grounds contains a short summary of
                    the background facts. It is now necessary to supplement that summary as our
                    present decision on costs is predicated on a broader foundation of facts that
                    include the conduct of the proceedings below as well as the relationship between
                    Ms Koh and Consult Asia Pte Ltd (“Consult Asia”), the
                    respondent in CA 19/2009 and the appellant in
                CA 90/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No 1044 of 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In OS 1044/2008, DB Trustees applied
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order that its appointment of
                    receivers and managers over Consult Asia on 4 July 2008 was valid. The
                    appointment was made pursuant to the existing security arrangement between the
                    parties. Ms Koh, who previously was a practising solicitor, owned all but
                    one of Consult Asia’s issued and paid up shares – this being 999,999
                    of Consult Asia’s one million shares. The last remaining share was held by
                    Ms Koh’s mother. Ms Koh was also, at the time of the hearing of
                    CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009, the only director of Consult
                Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 28 December 2006, Consult Asia entered
                    into an arrangement with UBS AG (“UBS”) for Consult Asia to issue
                    US$32 million worth of senior secured notes (“the Notes”).
                    The only notable assets owned by Consult Asia were mortgaged as security for the
                    redemption of the Notes – two pieces of real property located at Balestier
                    Road and Changi Road (collectively referred to as “the Security”
                    hereafter). DB Trustees acted as the trustee of the Security for the
                    holders of the Notes (“the Note-holders”).The overall effect of
                    all the documents signed in relation to this arrangement was that a
                    US$32 million credit facility was obtained by Consult Asia that was secured
                    by a floating charge over all of Consult Asia’s assets as well as a legal
                    mortgage over the Security. Chesterton International Property Consultants Pte
                    Ltd, which was the appointed valuer under the arrangement, provided a valuation
                    report which (rather optimistically) estimated that the Security was worth
                    S$107 million on an “as is” basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Consult Asia failed to redeem the Notes by
                    28 June 2008, which was the contractually stipulated redemption date.
                    Consequently, DB Trustees, after giving notice to Consult Asia, appointed
                    Mr Kon Yin Tong, Mr Wong Kian Kok and Mr Aw Eng Hai (collectively
                    referred to as “the Receivers” hereafter) as receivers and
                    managers on 4 July 2008 over the business and assets of Consult Asia.
                    However, when the Receivers attended at Consult Asia’s known address,
                    Ms Koh was not cooperative and denied the Receivers access to documents
                    pertaining to the affairs and property of Consult Asia. This precipitated the
                    filing of OS 1044/2008 by DB Trustees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       OS 1044/2008 first came before the
                    OS 1044/2008 Judge on 26 September 2008. During that hearing, Consult
                    Asia submitted that it was unable to obtain the requisite financing to redeem
                    the Notes because DB Trustees did not agree to release the Security
                    simultaneously with the payment of the redemption monies and had appointed the
                    Receivers. The OS 1044/2008 Judge then, without adjudicating on the merits
                    of the claim, gave directions for the receivership to be suspended for six weeks
                    and for Consult Asia to provide concrete evidence to DB Trustees of
                    alternative financing for US$42,080,000 (this being the redemption amount owed
                    by Consult Asia on or about 28 June 2008) by 7 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Despite this generous extension of time, Consult
                    Asia did not take effective steps to redeem the Notes. OS 1044/2008 was
                    eventually heard on its merits on 29 January 2009. At this point, the bare
                    evidence Consult Asia adduced in relation to the refinancing of the Notes
                    consisted of a letter dated 1 February 2008 from Merrill Lynch (Singapore)
                    Pte Ltd (“Merrill Lynch”) to Consult Asia. In that letter, Merrill
                    Lynch sought to confirm the arrangements under which Merrill Lynch would act as
                    an exclusive placement agent for Consult Asia in its issuance of “SGD
                    [90] million principal amount of senior secured notes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The proposed arrangements were
                    vaguely detailed in an attached annex entitled “Indicative Term Sheet
                    – For Discussion Purposes Only”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> No evidence was adduced by Consult
                    Asia to indicate what had happened to the proposed refinancing arrangements
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The OS 1044/2008 Judge eventually found in
                    favour of Consult Asia. The reasons for his decision can be found in <em>DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 62 (“the Enforcement Judgment”). He was,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, of the opinion that the letter
                    dated 1 February 2008 was both “clear” and “concrete
                    enough” evidence of the proposed refinancing obtained by Consult Asia and
                    was satisfied that Consult Asia had been impeded in its attempt to secure the
                    redemption of the Notes by DB Trustees’ refusal to release the
                    Security concurrently with the proposed redemption payment (see the Enforcement
                    Judgment at [39]). Accordingly, he discharged the appointment of the Receivers
                    made on 4 July 2008, and allowed Consult Asia up to 29 April 2009 to
                    redeem the Notes, failing which an “Event of Default” within the
                    meaning of the Trust Deed entered into by Consult Asia and DB Trustees would be
                    deemed to have occurred (see the Enforcement Judgment at [51]). Costs were fixed
                    at $2,000 (excluding reasonable disbursements) to be paid by DB Trustees to
                    Consult Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     DB Trustees appealed against the decision
                    of the OS 1044/2008 Judge by way of CA 19/2009. It is noteworthy that
                    Consult Asia failed to comply with the 29 April 2009 deadline, leading to
                    DB Trustees re-appointing the Receivers on 30 April 2009. In response,
                    Consult Asia filed OS 800/2009 against DB Trustees and the Receivers,
                    seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, a rescission of the
                    30 April 2009 appointment of the Receivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No 800 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     OS 800/2009 was heard by the
                    OS 800/2009 Judge on 21 July 2009. Before the OS 800/2009 Judge,
                    counsel for Consult Asia in OS 800/2009 (and subsequently CA 90/2009),
                    Mr Christopher Anand Daniel (“Mr Daniel”), provided two
                    main reasons as to why the Receivers ought to be discharged: first, the
                    appointment was wrong on a proper construction of the agreement between the
                    parties, and second, the Receivers had acted improperly in the discharge of
                    their duties as they had failed to provide relevant information to Consult Asia
                    on the sale process and had attempted to sell the Security at a severe
                    undervalue. By this time, the Receivers had commissioned a tender exercise which
                    was to close on 22 July 2009 in respect of the Changi Road property and
                    23 July 2009 in respect of the Balestier Road property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The OS 800/2009 Judge declined to grant
                    Consult Asia’s application on, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the basis that there was insufficient evidence before him to indicate that there
                    was any breach of duty on the part of the Receivers. Following that decision,
                    Mr Singh applied for the costs of OS 800/2009 to be paid by
                    Ms Koh personally. The OS 800/2009 Judge granted this application but
                    did not explain his decision. Consult Asia then appealed against the dismissal
                    of its application and the cost order by way of CA 90/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Civil Appeal No 19 of 2009 and Civil Appeal No 90 of
                2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In light of the closing dates for the tender
                    exercise commenced by the Receivers, Consult Asia applied, by way of an urgent
                    summons, <em>viz</em>, Summons No 3867 of 2009, for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, DB Trustees to be restrained
                    from dealing with any of Consult Asia’s assets pending the final disposal
                    of CA 90/2009 and for that appeal to be expedited and heard together with
                    CA 19/2009. This urgent application was granted on 23 July 2009 by
                    Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA, resulting in the joint hearing of both
                    CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009 before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Relevant to our present decision is also the
                    fact that the Receivers, by way of Originating Summons No 760 of 2009
                    (“OS 760/2009”), had applied, on 3 July 2009, for
                    Ms Koh to be made to personally provide security for
                    DB Trustees’ costs in CA 19/2009. The High Court judge who heard
                    the application dismissed it without giving written grounds. We might also add
                    that counsel for Consult Asia in CA 19/2009, Mr Ernest Yogarajah
                    Balasubramaniam (“Mr Balasubramaniam”), then rather
                    audaciously submitted that the Receivers should be made to personally pay the
                    costs of that hearing. The court rightly declined to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before us, most of the arguments that were
                    canvassed below were once again rehearsed. After hearing oral submission, we
                    made known our concerns about worrying gaps in the affidavit evidence. In
                    particular, we queried DB Trustees as to why it had not provided any
                    updated valuation report for the Security, given that the only valuation report
                    produced was dated July 2008. In relation to Consult Asia, we queried why it
                    could not have redeemed the Notes even without the release of the Security, and
                    why, even until the dates of the hearings of CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009
                    (30 July 2009 and 31 July 2009), it was still unable to redeem the
                    Notes, despite having obtained two extensions of time to do so. The parties then
                    requested for leave to adduce new evidence in relation to the above questions
                    and we acceded to their requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Pursuant to our directions, DB Trustees
                    filed an affidavit on 31 July 2009, in which valuation reports dated
                    6 July 2009 and 14 July 2009, which indicated that the Security was
                    worth a total of S$33 million as at July 2009, were exhibited. On the part
                    of Consult Asia, it filed an affidavit by Ms Koh dated 3 August 2009
                    (“the August Affidavit”), in which several letters and emails were
                    exhibited. After considering the new evidence, in the 6 August Decision, as
                    earlier mentioned (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), we held in
                    favour of DB Trustees for both CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009. The reasons
                    for our decision are set out in the Brief Grounds. In addition, the costs of
                    both appeals and the proceedings below were awarded to DB Trustees on an
                    indemnity basis. Thereafter, Mr Singh, through a letter dated 6 August
                    2009, submitted that “[Ms Koh] should be ordered to pay the costs of
                    both appeals instead of [Consult Asia]”. It appears that this submission
                    was made because Consult Asia’s assets were insufficient to meet the
                    outstanding sum due to DB Trustees. On this issue, we directed parties to
                    make full submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions by the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Daniel
                    responded in letters dated 11 August 2009. The thrusts of their arguments
                    were similar. They both accepted that the court had the power to make an order
                    for costs against a non-party but took the position that such an order should
                    not be made in the present matter for two main reasons. First, DB Trustees
                    did not, at any time prior to the release of the 6 August Decision (and the
                    Brief Grounds), provide any indication that Ms Koh ought to be made to
                    personally bear the costs of both appeals. It would, accordingly, be unfair to
                    make her do so now at this late stage. Second, Ms Koh owed fiduciary and
                    contractual duties, as the sole director, to act in the best interest of Consult
                    Asia, and the present proceedings were brought and conducted <em>bona fide</em> in the course of discharging those duties. It would be
                    unjust, in such circumstances, for her to be rendered liable for costs simply
                    because she had caused Consult Asia to participate in proceedings that turned
                    out to be unfavourable to the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In his letter in reply to the arguments of
                    Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Daniel dated 14 August 2009, Mr Singh
                    put forward a number of reasons in support of his submission that Ms Koh
                    ought to be made to pay the costs of the appeals, including:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     DB Trustees would be unfairly
                        prejudiced as Consult Asia would be unable to pay costs due to its state of
                        insolvency;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     while costs orders against a non-party should be exceptional, such an order
                        is appropriate when the non-party promotes legal proceedings by an insolvent
                        company solely or substantially for his or her own benefit as Ms Koh,
                        the major shareholder of Consult Asia, did;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     it was Ms Koh’s unreasonable
                        behaviour in refusing to cooperate with the Receivers, who were lawfully
                        appointed, which caused the incurring of unnecessary legal costs;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     it is not an
                        essential prerequisite for a non-party to be given notice of an intention to
                        seek costs against him or her before such an order may be
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After considering the submission of all of the
                    parties, we have determined that it is appropriate, in the present case, for
                    Ms Koh to bear the costs of both appeals, which were awarded on an
                    indemnity basis, jointly and severally with Consult Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before we set out our reasons for our
                    decision, we ought to clarify a factual crease in the Brief Grounds. Following
                    the release of the 6 August Decision and the Brief Grounds, Mr Daniel,
                    in his letter dated 11 August 2009, pointed out that a particular finding
                    set out in the Brief Grounds was not entirely accurate. In the Brief Grounds, we
                    had stated (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is our view that [the Receivers] had not breached any of the duties
                        allegedly owed to Consult Asia as receivers and managers. The manner in
                        which they had attempted to solicit offers for the Security was proper in
                        the prevailing circumstances. <u>They had obtained an
                            independent valuation report of the Security before the tender exercise
                            was carried out and had taken adequate steps to advertise the
                            sale</u>. [underlining added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Rightly, it was brought to our attention that the tender exercise was
                    first advertised on 17 June 2009 while the valuation reports tendered by
                    DB Trustees to us were dated 6 July 2009 and 14 July 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above). Hence, the underlined
                    portion of the passage above should have, instead, read as follows: “They
                    did not sell the Security before obtaining independent valuation reports and had
                    taken adequate steps to advertise the sale.” Needless to say, this
                    factual correction does not, in any way, affect the outcome of the matter. The
                    Receivers had not breached any of their duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     That said, we turn to the reasons for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It cannot be gainsaid that the following two
                    principles are trite in relation to an award of costs. First, costs are entirely
                    at the discretion of the court. We need look no further than O 59
                    r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”) for authority. The said provision reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the express provisions of any written law and of these Rules,
                        the costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court or the
                        Subordinate Courts, including the administration of estates and trusts,
                            <em>shall be in the discretion of the Court, and the
                            Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent the
                            costs are to be paid</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Karting Club of Singapore v Mak David and others
                        (Wee Soon Kim Anthony, intervener)</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 786
                        (“<em>Karting Club</em>”), Chan Sek
                    Keong J declared (at [6]) that “[t]he power so conferred [is]
                    completely unfettered … [although] … it must be exercised
                    judicially.” Second, the general rule is that costs are to follow the
                    event (see O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is no rule that states that the
                    court’s power to award costs does not extend to awarding costs in favour
                    of or against a non-party, and, in our view, there is no reason why the court
                    should be precluded from awarding costs in favour of or against a non-party. A
                    similar position was taken by the Federal Court of Australia in <em>O’Keefe v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd</em>
                    [2005] FCA 1559 (“<em>O’Keefe</em>”) and the High Court of Australia (“the
                    HCA”) in <em>Knight and another v FP Special Assets
                        Limited and others</em> (1992) 174 CLR 178 (“<em>Knight</em>”). In <em>O’Keefe</em>, Nicholson J held that the jurisdiction of
                    the court to award costs, pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of
                    Australia Act 1976 (Cth), was sufficiently wide to enable the court to make an
                    order for costs in favour of a non-party without the non-party being formally
                    made a party to the proceedings. The HCA in <em>Knight</em>, by a majority, decided that the Supreme Court of Queensland,
                    by virtue of O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Qld), could
                    award costs against a non-party. Mason CJ and Deane J reasoned (at
                    185):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">According to their natural and ordinary meaning, <em>the
                            words of the rule are sufficiently expansive to enable the Court to make
                            an order for costs against a person, whether that person is formally a
                            party to the proceedings or not</em>. The jurisdiction and the
                        discretion thereby conferred are not limited. Because they are not limited
                        it is easy to postulate a variety of circumstances where an exercise of the
                        jurisdiction against a non-party would be extravagant and unjust. However,
                        the existence of that possibility provides no justification for the
                        imposition by the courts, by way of implication, of an arbitrary limitation
                        upon the general jurisdiction conferred by the rule. To do so would, as will
                        appear, deny power to the Court to order costs against a non-party in cases
                        in which, in the interests of justice, such orders should be made. <em>The inevitable answer to arguments directed to limiting curial
                            jurisdiction based on the supposition that the jurisdiction might lend
                            itself to abuse is that the court will and should develop principles
                            governing the exercise of the discretion which will ensure that the
                            jurisdiction is not exercised in such a way as to give rise to
                            abuse</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In our view, the wording of O 59
                    r 2(2) of the Rules is similarly sufficiently expansive to enable us to
                    make an order for costs against a non-party, whether or not that party is
                    formally a party to the proceedings or not. Parenthetically, it may be noted
                    that Rule 48.2 of the Civil Procedure Rules (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK)
                    expressly stipulates that a non-party must be added as a party to the
                    proceedings for the purposes of costs only before an English court can order
                    costs against or in the non-party’s favour. There is no local equivalent
                    of that rule. That said, to date, no local case has established the general
                    principles or guidelines as to when costs should be awarded in favour of or
                    against a non-party, although such awards are not non-existent (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Ng Eng Chee and others v Mamata
                        Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partner Pte Ltd, intervener) and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 155). With respect to costs
                    against a non-party, two influential appellate decisions – one from the
                    English Court of Appeal and the other from the Privy Council – are
                    instructive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the English Court of Appeal case of
                        <em>Symphony Group PLC v Hodgson</em> [1994]
                    1 QB 179 (“<em>Symphony</em>”),
                    Balcombe LJ stated (at 192–193):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In my judgment the following are material
                        considerations to be taken into account, although I do not suggest that
                        there may not be others which are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(1)    An order for the payment of costs by a
                                non-party will always be exceptional …. The judge should
                                treat any application for such an order with considerable
                                caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    It will be even more exceptional for an order
                                for the payment of costs to be made against a non-party, where the
                                applicant has a cause of action against the non-party and could have
                                joined him as a party to the original proceedings. Joinder as a
                                party to the proceedings gives the person concerned all the
                                protection conferred by the rules ….</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(3)    Even if the applicant can provide a good
                                reason for not joining the non-party against whom he has a valid
                                cause of action, he should warn the non-party at the earliest
                                opportunity of the possibility that he may seek to apply for costs
                                against him. At the very least this will give the non-party an
                                opportunity to apply to be joined as a party to the action
                                ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Ten years later, the Privy Council, in
                        <em>Dymocks Franchise Systems (NSW) Pty Ltd v Todd and others
                        (Associated Industrial Finance Pty Ltd, Third Party)</em> [2004]
                    1 WLR 2807 (“<em>Dymocks</em>”),
                    framed the relevant considerations as follows (at 2815):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A number of the decided cases have sought to catalogue the main principles
                        governing the proper exercise of this discretion and their Lordships, rather
                        than undertake an exhaustive further survey of the many relevant cases,
                        would seek to summarise the position as follows. (1) <em>Although costs orders against non-parties are to be regarded as
                            “exceptional”, exceptional in this context means no more
                            than outside the ordinary run of cases where parties pursue or defend
                            claims for their own benefit and at their own expense. The ultimate
                            question in any such “exceptional” case is whether in all
                            the circumstances it is just to make the order</em>. It must be
                        recognised that this is inevitably to some extent a fact-specific
                        jurisdiction and that there will often be a number of different
                        considerations in play, some militating in favour of an order, some against.
                        (2) Generally speaking the discretion will not be exercised against
                        “pure funders” …. In their case the court’s usual
                        approach is to give priority to the public interest in the funded party
                        getting access to justice over that of the successful unfunded party
                        recovering his costs and so not having to bear the expense of vindicating
                        his rights. (3) <em>Where, however, the non-party not merely
                            funds the proceedings but substantially also controls or at any rate is
                            to benefit from them, justice will ordinarily require that, if the
                            proceedings fail, he will pay the successful party’s
                            costs</em>. The non-party in these cases is not so much
                        facilitating access to justice by the party funded as himself gaining access
                        to justice for his own purposes. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On our part, we are of view that the above
                    passage from <em>Dymock</em> is particularly helpful. The
                    ultimate question in any such “exceptional” case, as the Privy
                    Council observed, must be whether, in all the circumstances, it is just to make
                    the order. The following observation in <em>Globe Equities
                        Limited v Globe Legal Services Limited and ors</em>
                    [1999] BLR 232 (“<em>Globe
                    Equities</em>”) is also apposite (at 240):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately the test is whether in all the circumstances it is just to
                        exercise the power conferred by subsections (1) and (3) of
                        section 51 Supreme Court Act 1981 to make a non-party pay the costs of
                        the proceedings. Plainly in the ordinary run of cases where the party is
                        pursuing or defending the claim for his own benefit through solicitors
                        acting as such there is not usually any justification for making someone
                        else pay the costs. But there will be cases where either or both these two
                        features are absent. In such cases it will be a matter for judgment and the
                        exercise by the judge of his discretion to decide whether the circumstances
                        relied on are such as to make it just to order some non-party to pay the
                        costs. Thus, as it seems to me, the exceptional case is one to be recognised
                        by comparison with the ordinary run of cases not defined in advance by
                        reference to any further characteristic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For completeness we ought to point out that,
                    in <em>Chin Yoke Choong Bobby and another v Hong Lam Marine Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 907 (“<em>Bobby Chin</em>”), this court decided that the courts have no
                    power, upon a proper interpretation of O 59 r 2(2) of the Rules, to
                    order a non-party to pay the costs of arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, it
                    was acknowledged that an order for costs of <em>court
                        proceedings</em> could be granted against a non-party where just to do
                    so. The following was stated (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While we were prepared to recognise that under O 59 r 2(2) the
                        court had the jurisdiction and discretion to order, <em>in
                            circumstances where it was just to do so</em>, a non-party such as
                        a receiver to be personally liable for costs of court proceedings, we did
                        not think that such a jurisdiction existed in the instant case. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     From <em>Dymocks</em> and
                        <em>Globe Equities</em>, as well as <em>Bobby Chin</em>, it is clear that the overarching rule with regard to
                    ordering costs against a non-party in court proceedings is that it must, in the
                    circumstances of the case, be <em>just</em> to do so. That
                    said, it appears to us that two particular factors, among the myriad of possibly
                    relevant considerations, ought to almost always be present to make it just to
                    award costs against a non-party. This does not, however, mean that they are
                    indispensable prerequisites that have to be met before a costs order against a
                    non-party can be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The first of the two factors is that there
                    must be a <em>close connection</em> between the non-party
                    and the proceedings. The following sentence from the passage in <em>Dymocks</em> that was quoted at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above would indicate one way in which a close connection
                    may be demonstrated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, however, the non-party not merely funds the proceedings but
                        substantially also controls or at any rate is to benefit from them, justice
                        will ordinarily require that, if the proceedings fail, he will pay the
                        successful party’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">One clarification that we should make is that funding and control need
                    not be conjunctive, as seems to be suggested in the above sentence. It is
                    sufficient that the non-party either funds or controls legal proceedings with
                    the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     One example of funding that would allow for a
                    finding of a close connection can be found in the case of <em>Dymocks</em> itself. In that case, the underlying proceedings
                    involved Dymocks Franchise Systems (NSW) Pty Ltd (“Dymocks”), on
                    the one hand, and four parties collectively referred to as “the
                    Todds”, on the other. The litigation between the parties consisted of
                    three rounds, so to speak: (a) before the New Zealand High Court;
                    (b) before the New Zealand Court of Appeal (“the NZCA”); and
                    (c) before the Privy Council. At each stage, the relevant non-party,
                    Associated Industrial Finance Pty Ltd (“Associated”), funded the
                    litigation of the Todds by providing them with loans. Apart from funding, there
                    was little evidence that Associated was otherwise involved in the litigation.
                    However, it was principally Associated which stood to benefit from the success
                    of the Todds in the appeals before the NZCA and the Privy Council, and this was
                    taken into account by the Privy Council in its decision to order costs against
                    Associated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Another way of evidencing a close connection
                    may be drawn from <em>Karting Club</em>. In that case, the
                    plaintiff, an unincorporated club, applied, by way of an originating summons,
                    for a declaration that the four defendants were deemed to have retired as
                    officers and/or committee members of the club as they had failed to attend three
                    consecutive club meetings. F A Chua J dismissed the originating
                    summons and ordered costs against the chairman of the club, Anthony Wee Soon Kim
                    (“Wee”), who was a non-party to the proceedings. Thereafter, Wee
                    applied to intervene in the proceedings to be added as a defendant with the
                    further intention of applying to set aside the costs order. Chan Sek
                    Keong J, in dismissing the application, held as follows (at [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second reason why the application [to intervene] was misconceived was
                        even more obvious. The plaintiffs were an unincorporated association and the
                        applicant [<em>ie</em>, Wee] was its chairman. He and
                        his fellow members were the plaintiffs. The applicant was found by F A
                        Chua J to have been responsible for initiating an unwarranted action in
                        the name of the club against the defendants. Accordingly, if costs had been
                        ordered against the plaintiffs, it would have meant that the successful
                        defendants and the other members had to finance the unwarranted action
                        brought at the instigation of the applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Plainly, Wee could be said to have had a close connection with the
                    unwarranted action due to his role in initiating it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This court in <em>Godfrey
                        Gerald QC v UBS AG and others</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 306
                    adopted a similar tack. The backdrop to the appellate proceedings before this
                    court was that Wee (the non-party involved in <em>Karting
                        Club</em>), had filed a suit in which he alleged that UBS had made
                    several misrepresentations in inducing him to adopt a certain financial course
                    of action. Subsequently, a Queen’s Counsel, Godfrey Gerald QC,
                    applied, at the behest of Wee, for admission on an <em>ad
                        hoc</em> basis to the Singapore Bar for the purpose of representing
                    Wee in his suit. The High Court judge who heard the application declined to
                    grant it and ordered Wee, who was a non-party to the application, to pay $5,000
                    in costs to UBS. This decision was affirmed by this court. In so doing, this
                    court held (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We found that there were ample grounds for the judge to order that [Wee]
                        be personally liable for costs. … [Wee] was responsible for
                        initiating an unwarranted application. As the judge below expressly found,
                        it was [Wee’s] own unjustifiable stance that no local counsel would be
                        fit for the job that was responsible for the predicament that he was
                        in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     These cases serve to illustrate the point that
                    there will be many ways to demonstrate a close connection between the non-party
                    and the legal proceedings in question. At the end of the day, whether this
                    factor is adequately shown depends on the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The other factor, which is related to but
                    distinct from the first, is that the non-party must have caused the incurring of
                    costs. This is a matter of causation which has often been glossed over in case
                    law. Ordinarily, it would not be just to order a non-party, as opposed to a
                    litigant, to pay costs if the litigant would have incurred the legal costs
                    regardless of the non-party’s role. It suffices to cite the Privy
                    Council’s observation on this point in <em>Dymocks</em> (at 2814):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the position may well be different when a number of non-parties
                        act in concert, their Lordships are content to assume for the purposes of
                        this application that a non-party could not ordinarily be made liable for
                        costs if those costs would in any event have been incurred even without such
                        non-party’s involvement in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of course, this factor may be established by the very same facts which
                    go toward the establishment of the first factor, <em>ie</em>, a close connection between the non-party and the
                    proceedings. In <em>Dymocks</em>, the Privy Council decided
                    that but for Associated’s involvement, the appellate proceedings, which
                    led to the incurring of further costs, would not have taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We summarise. The core consideration in
                    relation to the court’s exercise of discretion in ordering costs against a
                    non-party is that it must be <em>just</em>, in all the
                    circumstances of the case, to do so. In assessing whether it would be just to do
                    so, a variety of factors, including those enumerated in <em>Symphony</em> and <em>Dymocks</em> may be
                    relevant. Ordinarily, considerable weight would be placed on the presence of two
                    factors, <em>viz</em>, a close connection between the
                    non-party and the proceedings and a causal link between the non-party and the
                    incurring of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our view, three critical factors weighed in
                    favour of an order for Ms Koh to pay the costs of the appeals and the
                    proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     First, Ms Koh, being at all material
                    times the only director, was solely responsible for Consult Asia’s
                    participation in CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009, as well as the underlying
                    actions. These proceedings, at their roots, stemmed from Consult Asia’s
                    (and Ms Koh’s) unreasonable stance in not cooperating with the
                    Receivers, who had been lawfully appointed by DB Trustees. As we have
                    explained in the Brief Grounds, it was axiomatic that Consult Asia was not in a
                    realistic position to obtain fresh financing during the material period to
                    redeem the Notes. The documentary evidence adduced, pursuant to our directions,
                    showed that Consult Asia had been unable, even as late as mid-June 2008, to
                    resolve the terms of the refinancing arrangements with Merrill Lynch. In this
                    regard, we reject Ms Koh’s explanation in the August Affidavit that
                    the reason why the Merrill Lynch refinancing plan fell through was because
                    DB Trustees refused to release the Security concurrently with the payment
                    of the redemption monies. This was an absurd excuse. In several emails to
                    Ms Koh from end-May 2008 to early-June 2008, the solicitors acting for
                    Consult Asia in the Merrill Lynch refinancing, Lee &amp; Lee, referred
                    to “outstanding commercial issues”, “outstanding
                    points” and “pending discussions” to be resolved between
                    Merrill Lynch and Consult Asia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Yet,
                    there is nothing to suggest that DB Trustees’ insistence on releasing
                    the Security after the redemption monies had been paid had any impact on the
                    refinancing proposal. Ms Koh failed to give any credible explanation as to
                    why the refinancing proposal was called off by Merrill Lynch. In fact, it seems
                    to us that any email that would have explained what the outstanding issues were
                    between Consult Asia and Merrill Lynch was deliberately not exhibited in the
                    August Affidavit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and it would appear
                    that the real reason for the proposal being called off was Merrill Lynch’s
                    concern about the value of the Security. There is good reason to believe that
                    Ms Koh had been less than candid in the proceedings before us and
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It was suggested by Mr Daniel that
                    Ms Koh was acting <em>bona fide</em> in her discharge
                    of her duties as a director of Consult Asia in causing Consult Asia to defend in
                    OS 1044/2008. We do not agree. Ms Koh, as a former lawyer and, now, a
                    savvy businesswoman should have been well aware that if Consult Asia failed to
                    redeem the Notes by the contractually stipulated redemption date,
                    DB Trustees would be entitled to appoint receivers and managers over the
                    business and assets of Consult Asia. That being the case, it can hardly be said
                    that she was, when Consult Asia failed to redeem the Notes by 28 June 2008,
                    acting reasonably or <em>bona fide</em> in the best
                    interest of Consult Asia in refusing to cooperate with the Receivers and in
                    subsequently causing Consult Asia to defend in OS 1044/2008 and respond in
                    CA 19/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The commencement of OS 800/2009 and the
                    filing of CA 90/2009 would be even more troubling. (It must be remembered
                    that OS 800/2009 was filed after the OS 1044/2008 Judge had given
                    Consult Asia <em>two</em> extensions of time to obtain
                    refinancing.) The bases on which Consult Asia’s case was put in
                    OS 800/2009 and CA 90/2009, as we explained in the Brief Grounds, were
                    entirely devoid of merit. In fact, they were so dubious that we have to conclude
                    that OS 800/2009 and CA 90/2009 were not brought <em>bona fide</em>. It would appear that these proceedings were employed
                    by Consult Asia as a delaying contrivance to impede the sale of the Security
                    – a right that DB Trustees possessed as far back as 29 June
                    2008. That such a tactic was persisted with even after the OS 1044/2008
                    Judge had, on no less than two separate occasions, given Consult Asia grace
                    periods to redeem the Notes was a patent abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second, it cannot be gainsaid the Ms Koh
                    was the <em>alter ego</em> of Consult Asia. She was, to all
                    intents and purposes, the only shareholder and director of Consult Asia. In this
                    regard, we note that all affidavits filed on behalf of Consult Asia were sworn
                    by her. Admittedly, that fact in itself cannot be held against her. However, we
                    also note that as Ms Koh was, in essence, the only shareholder, the real
                    and only beneficiary of any successful outcome of Consult Asia’s
                    litigation would be her. She, alone, stood to gain from the survival of Consult
                    Asia and the preservation of its assets. In the prevailing circumstances, the
                    relationship between Ms Koh and all of the proceedings in question was so
                    close that it would not be unjust to make her liable for costs. As the Privy
                    Council in <em>Dymocks</em> aptly put it in the following
                    sentence from the passage that was quoted at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, however, the non-party not merely funds the proceedings but
                        substantially also controls or at any rate is to benefit from them, justice
                        will ordinarily require that, if the proceedings fail, he will pay the
                        successful party’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Here, Ms Koh directed Consult Asia’s unreasonable conduct
                    in the proceedings and stood to gain from any success that Consult Asia may have
                    enjoyed – this apparently without incurring a corresponding risk from any
                    failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, it is also relevant that Consult Asia
                    appears to be unable to satisfy the adverse costs orders made. As mentioned
                    earlier (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), Consult Asia’s
                    only major assets were its Balestier Road and Changi Road properties (<em>ie</em>, the Security). Pursuant to the tender exercise
                    commissioned by the Receivers, the highest offers for the Balestier Road and
                    Changi Road properties were, respectively, below S$10 million and slightly
                    above S$30 million. Furthermore, the valuation reports dated 6 July
                    2009 and 14 July 2009 indicated that the combined value of the Security was
                    just S$33 million. Mr Singh, in his letter dated 14 August 2009,
                    drew our attention to the fact that Consult Asia’s liabilities under the
                    Notes would now be in excess of S$60 million. Clearly, DB Trustees
                    would be hard pressed to help the Notes-holders recover from Consult Asia all
                    that was owed to them under the Notes, let alone the costs of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For these reasons, we have arrived at the view
                    that it is just, in the circumstances of the case, to accede to DB
                    Trustees’ request that Ms Koh should be made liable for the costs of
                    the appeals. Not only was there a close connection between Ms Koh and the
                    proceedings, Ms Koh had in fact caused the incurring of unnecessary legal
                    costs which Consult Asia was unable to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The requirement of prior warning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     For completeness, we now turn to address the
                    other plank of the arguments of Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Daniel,
                    which was that a non-party must be informed or warned, prior to the conclusion
                    of the proceedings, of any intention to seek an order for costs against him or
                    her before such an order can be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     At first blush, it appears that there is some
                    basis for this view. We have already mentioned <em>Symphony</em>, which classified the requirement of prior warning as
                    one of a number of “material considerations” (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above). Having regard to <em>Symphony</em>, the English High Court in <em>Shah and
                        another v Karanjia and another</em> [1993] 4 All ER 792,
                    took into consideration, <em>inter alia</em>, the lack of
                    prior warning to dismiss an application for a non-party to pay costs. In that
                    case, the plaintiffs entered into various agreements with the defendants
                    pursuant to which the plaintiffs transferred their shares in a property company
                    to the defendants. The main asset of the property company was a piece of land
                    which, shortly after the transfer, the defendants managed to sell for
                    substantial profit. The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants
                    claiming that they had been tricked into transferring the shares in the belief
                    that the shares would be further transferred to a non-party, known as Ashok Shah
                    (“Ashok”). The judge, Vinelott J, found that the suit was a
                    malicious fabrication initiated in the misconceived hope that the defendants
                    would disgorge some of the profits that they had rightfully earned. When it
                    became apparent that the plaintiffs would be unable to pay costs, the defendants
                    sought an order that Ashok be made to pay costs on the basis that Ashok had
                    conspired with and induced the plaintiffs to institute the malicious proceedings
                    and had funded such litigation. Vinelott J declined to make the order, with
                    one of the main reasons given being that Ashok had no warning that he might be
                    made to pay the costs of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     A Singapore case would appear to provide some
                    penumbral support for the view that prior warning is necessary before costs can
                    be ordered against a non-party. In <em>Har Chee Choey v Lee Khai
                        Seng and another</em> [2003] SGDC 237, the District Court
                    held (at [21]) that it could not grant the application to make a non-party pay
                    costs because it was “oppressive to the repairers, a non-party to the
                    action, to be sprung with a surprise attack, at the conclusion of the trial, to
                    pay the costs to the defendants”. <em>Dymocks</em>,
                    however, would suggest the contrary. In that case, one argument raised by
                    counsel for Associated was that Associated had no warning of an intention to ask
                    for costs against it. The Privy Council, in dismissing this argument, stressed
                    that the presence of prior warning “is no more than a material
                    consideration” and that “their Lordships are unable to see how an
                    earlier warning could have made any difference to the course of the
                    proceedings” (at 2818). It was elaborated that there was no suggestion
                    that Associated would have acted differently if it had been given prior warning
                    or that Associated could have “sensibly” been made a party to the
                    proceedings at an earlier stage (at 2818).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In our view, there cannot be an unbending
                    proposition that a non-party must be given prior warning before an order for
                    costs can be made against the non-party. This would be contrary to the rule that
                    costs are ordered according to the unfettered discretion of the court, save that
                    such discretion must be exercised judiciously (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). This rule means that the court may make any order
                    as to costs as long as it is just in the circumstances to do so. To imply a
                    requirement that a non-party must be given prior warning before an order for
                    costs can be made against the non-party would be to unnecessarily fetter the
                    very broad discretion provided in O 59 r 2(2) of the Rules. Of course,
                    we recognise that, in certain instances, the non-party may be prejudiced by not
                    having been warned. Even so, the lack of a warning ought to be properly assessed
                    and balanced against other factors in the exercise of the court’s
                    discretion to order costs. Furthermore, this disadvantage can be ameliorated, if
                    not eliminated, by ensuring that there is due process accorded to the non-party
                    before any order is made. In short, there is no indispensable rule of practice
                    that a non-party must be given prior warning before an adverse order for costs
                    is made. What is <em>essential</em> is that the non-party
                    must be <em>accorded due process</em> and his or her
                        <em>views adequately considered</em> before such an
                    order is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, Ms Koh has been
                    allowed, through Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Daniel, to make submissions
                    on costs to us. Moreover, we are satisfied that Ms Koh would have known
                    that a submission that she should pay costs was always on the cards.
                    OS 760/2009, which was filed by the Receivers, was an application for
                    Ms Koh to personally provide security for DB Trustees’ costs in
                    relation to CA 19/2009. In addition, DB Trustees applied to the
                    OS 800/2009 Judge for Ms Koh to be made to pay the costs of
                    OS 800/2009. Therefore, it would not be unreasonable to presume that Mr
                    Singh’s submission that Ms Koh should pay the costs of the appeals
                    would have been of little or no surprise to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We are of the view that Ms Koh has
                    plainly abused the judicial process. She has dragged the matter on for more than
                    a year without any plausible reasons for believing that Consult Asia could repay
                    the Note-holders. This delay prejudiced the Note-holders’ right to realise
                    the Security and recover monies due to them. This is a case where the <em>alter ego</em> of a single-director entity had adopted
                    delaying tactics vexatiously. Our determination is also influenced by the fact
                    that Consult Asia does not appear to be able to pay the costs orders made
                    against it and that Ms Koh had, in fact, caused the incurring of
                    unnecessary costs. She must have known that Consult Asia, a corporate fig leaf
                    for her, would not or could not settle any adverse costs orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the circumstances, it is right and just to
                    order that Ms Koh bear the costs of CA 19/2009 and CA 90/2009,
                    which were awarded on an indemnity basis, jointly and severally with Consult
                    Asia. We would add for avoidance of doubt that the cost order of the
                    OS 800/2009 Judge against Ms Koh remains as we dismissed the appeal
                    against his decision.</p>
