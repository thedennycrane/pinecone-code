<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This Registrar’s Appeal No 290 of 2013
                    (“RA 290”), which was brought by the plaintiff, Fairmacs Shipping
                    &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd (“FSPL”), arose from the decision
                    of the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) on the quantum of damages
                    awarded on conversion of a consignment of river sand by the second defendant,
                    Marco Polo Shipping Company Pte Ltd (“D2”). The main ground of
                    appeal in RA 290 related to the method of assessment of damages consequent on
                    the conversion of the consignment of river sand and the essential principles
                    that govern this area of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, Harikutai Engineering Pte
                    Ltd (“D1”), did not appear at the assessment of damages before the
                    AR. RA 290 did not concern D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the hearing on 22 July
                    2014, I allowed FSPL’s appeal and awarded the sum of US$141,226 as the
                    quantum of damages payable by D2 with interest thereon computed at the rate of
                    5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ of Summons to the date of payment. I
                    also ordered costs of the appeal to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       D2 has appealed against my decision in RA 290. I
                    now give my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts leading to the conversion of the river sand shipped
                on board the <em>Bina Marine 36</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By a contract of sale dated 18 August 2011
                    (“the S&amp;P contract”), FSPL agreed to purchase river sand from
                    one Marine Alliance Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Marine Alliance”)
                    on CNF terms. The S&amp;P contract provided for three shipments of 4000 metric
                    tonnes (“mt”) (+/- 5%) of river sand from Myeik, Myanmar to Port
                    Blair, India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       This action concerned the second shipment of
                    river sand under the S&amp;P contract. The second shipment was for a consignment
                    of 4,300 mt of river sand of Myeik origin (“the cargo”) that was
                    loaded on board D2’s unmanned barge <em>Bina Marine
                        36</em> at Myeik for carriage to and discharge at Port Blair. Bill of
                    lading no HKE-0712 dated 12 September 2011 (“the bill of lading”),
                    which was on the Congenbill 2007 form, was issued by D1 as the contracting
                    carrier. The bill of lading named Marine Alliance as the shipper of the cargo.
                    FSPL was the owner of the cargo, and the bill of lading named FSPL as the
                    consignee. At all material times, D2, as the performing carrier, was sub-bailee
                    of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At all material times, the <em>Bina Marine 36</em> was paired with the tugboat <em>Bina Marine 35</em>. The tug-barge combination (hereafter referred to
                    as “the tow”) was expected to discharge the cargo at Port Blair on
                    1 October 2011, but the tow did not turn up at Port Blair on 1 October 2011 or
                    at any time thereafter. When FSPL made inquiries about the whereabouts of the
                    cargo on or about 3 October 2011, it was told by one Mr Danads Wong, an employee
                    of D2, that the tow was on the “last leg of the voyage proceeding very
                    slowly to Port Blair due to weather conditions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 18 October 2011, FSPL’s solicitors
                    wrote to both defendants demanding delivery up of the cargo. The present action
                    was commenced on 15 December 2011 following the defendants’ failure to
                    deliver up the cargo. FSPL’s principal claim against D2 was for the
                    delivery up of the cargo by D2. At that time, FSPL was not aware that the cargo
                    had been sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       FSPL filed for summary judgment on 20 February
                    2012. Both defendants opposed FSPL’s application for summary
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Earlier, D2 applied for security for costs on
                    28 December 2011. It was at that point that FSPL learnt for the first time that
                    the cargo had been sold. Mr Azhari Bin Mohd Jadi (“Mr Azhari”),
                    the Operations Manager of D2, deposed in his first affidavit that D2 withdrew
                    the tow and, in the process, sold the cargo on account of D1’s default in
                    the payment of charter hire owed to D2. Mr Azhari’s second affidavit filed
                    on 13 January 2012 stated that the cargo was sold by its wholly owned
                    subsidiary, MP Shipping Pte Ltd (“MP Shipping”). There was no
                    other information on how much the cargo was sold for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     FSPL succeeded in obtaining interlocutory
                    judgment with damages to be assessed against the defendants on 15 June 2012. The
                    defendants were found to be severally liable to FSPL for the loss of the cargo.
                    D2 appealed against the decision on liability, but the appeal was dismissed on 3
                    August 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Assistant Registrar’s assessment of damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     FSPL asked for damages to be assessed at
                    US$201,455. Mr Joseph Tan (“Mr Tan”), counsel for FSPL, submitted
                    that the value of the cargo based on the market price of comparable river sand
                    at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011 was US$46.85 per metric tonne
                    (“pmt”). For this, he relied on invoices from FSPL’s sister
                    company, Fairmacs Trading Company Pte Ltd (“Fairmacs Trading”),
                    that supported comparable sales of river sand to third parties at Port Blair
                    from 3 October 2011 to 7 October 2011 to arrive at an average price of US$46.85
                        pmt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He thus quantified
                    FSPL’s claims against both defendants severally at US$201,455 (US$46.85
                    pmt x 4,300 mt of the cargo quantity shipped on board the <em>Bina Marine 36</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for D2, Mr Mathiew Christophe Rajoo
                    (“Mr Rajoo”), disagreed with FSPL’s method of assessment of
                    damages. He submitted that there was no readily available market for river sand
                    at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011. As such, there was no
                    ascertainable market value to fix the value of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The AR rejected FSPL’s valuation and
                    held that damages should be assessed at US$62,950. That figure reflected: (a)
                    the cost incurred by FSPL in obtaining the cargo; and (b) the loss actually
                    sustained by FSPL. The AR’s reasoning was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_i"></a>(i)     There was no market index for river
                        sand at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The market value of US$46.85 pmt was
                        arrived at without any specific breakdown as to the cost of the river sand,
                        the freight charges, and other relevant expenses in respect of the shipments
                        such that the actual profits of Fairmacs Trading, which constitute part of
                        the US$46.85 pmt rate, could not be ascertained — this was especially
                        pertinent given that the cost price of the cargo under the S&amp;P contract
                        was US$22.30 pmt, a rate substantially lower than US$46.85 pmt;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The market
                        value of US$46.85 pmt was arrived at by comparing low-volume sales of river
                        sand at no more than 7 mt per sale and it was therefore unlikely for
                        the same rate of US$46.85 pmt to apply to the cargo of
                    4,300 mt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Given his finding that there was no
                    ascertainable market value for river sand at Port Blair in the first week of
                    October 2011, the AR opined that the proper basis of assessment in this case was
                    the cost of replacing the cargo. He relied on the S&amp;P contract between FSPL
                    and Marine Alliance where FSPL bought the cargo for US$95,890 (<em>ie</em>, US$22.30 pmt x 4,300 mt). Having noted that FSPL had
                    in fact only paid US$62,950 for its purchase of the cargo (see [14] above), the
                    AR proceeded to assess damages to be paid by D2 for its wrongful conversion of
                    the cargo at US$62,950.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     FSPL pressed for an award of damages against
                    D1 despite D1’s absence at the hearing of the assessment. The AR’s
                    award of damages against D1 was the consequence of the summary judgment against
                    D1 as contractual carrier, and in principle each conversion amounted to a
                    separate wrong causing its own separate damage. The AR held D1 to be severally
                    liable for the same amount of damages that D2 was liable for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of the parties’ arguments in RA 290 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As stated earlier, the main ground of appeal
                    related to the method of assessment of damages consequent on the conversion of
                    the cargo and the essential principles that govern this area of the law. Hence,
                    the argument between the parties focussed on the monetary liability of D2 to
                    FSPL as a consequence of D2’s conversion of the cargo by the wrongful
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Tan submitted that the normal measure of
                    damages in a conversion case was the market value of the goods converted at the
                    place and date of conversion plus any consequential losses that were not too
                    remote in law. Mr Tan confirmed at the hearing of RA 290 that FSPL was not
                    claiming for consequential losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     For RA 290, FSPL resorted to the same evidence
                    it had relied on at the hearing before the AR. That is to say, the evidence of
                    Mr Babuvenkatesh Loganathan (“Mr Loganathan”), the General Manager
                    of Fairmacs Trading, and the invoices provided by Fairmacs Shipping (see [12]
                    above). It was submitted that FSPL’s evidence was adequate proof that
                    US$46.85 pmt was the market value of the cargo at the relevant time and place,
                    and that this was the valuation the court should adopt in determining the value
                    of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For D2, Mr Rajoo contended that Mr Tan’s
                    approach was incorrect as there was no readily available market at Port Blair in
                    the first week of October 2011, and, hence, there was no ascertainable market
                    value. To Mr Rajoo, the cargo was converted at sea and subsequently sold, and as
                    such, a different basis from the market value of the goods converted applied.
                    The proper valuation to adopt <em>vis-à-vis</em> the value
                    of the cargo would be to use the cost price of the goods and the freight paid as
                    was the case in <em>Ewbank v Nutting</em> (1849) 7CB 797
                        (“<em>Ewbank</em>”). He submitted that
                    the <em>Ewbank</em> approach should be used, but subject
                    always to FSPL’s actual loss.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He accepted
                    that the <em>Ewbank</em> approach and the AR’s
                    methodology, based on the cost incurred by FSPL in purchasing the cargo from
                    Marine Alliance under the S&amp;P contract, would lead to the same conclusion
                    and result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Rajoo accepted that the AR was right in
                    assessing damages payable by D2 for the tort of conversion at US$62,950, which
                    quantum of damages took into consideration the actual cost incurred by
                    FSPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues for decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the basis of these arguments (at
                    [17]–[21] above), the main issue for decision was the proper measure of
                    damages for conversion of the cargo by D2 on the facts of this case. In other
                    words, did the facts of this case require the application of a different basis
                    of valuation instead of the market value measure of damages for conversion? In
                    particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was there a market for river sand at

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary points</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this action, FSPL sought compensatory
                    damages for the misappropriation of the cargo by the wrongful sale of the same.
                    By way of observation, there is potentially an alternative remedy for such a
                    wrong at common law. A modern way of putting this alternative remedy is an award
                    of restitutionary damages rather than the usual compensatory damages. I will
                    elaborate on this alternative remedy in due course (at [84]–[90]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is not controversial that the object of an
                    award of damages for conversion is to compensate a plaintiff for the loss which
                    he has suffered as a result of the conversion. Typically, the normal measure of
                    damages is the value of the goods converted at the time and place of
                    conversation. It is also not controversial that one way of putting a monetary
                    figure on the value of the goods converted is to use “market
                    value” because “market value” is looked upon as the fairest
                    way to objectively assess the value of the goods converted. In <em>The Arpad</em> [1934] P 189, the English Court of Appeal held
                    that the market value was the best evidence of the converted wheat’s
                    value, <em>not</em> the amount the plaintiff bought and
                    sold it for. Greer LJ said, at p 210:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is a market at the time when the goods should be delivered in
                        which goods of a kind fit to implement the contract made by the owner of the
                        bill of lading at the time of the breach can be bought or sold, the measure
                        of damage is the value of the goods ascertained by the market price of
                        identically similar goods. … [T]he price at which the buyer has
                        resold the goods may be accepted as evidence of their value, but the court
                        is not bound to accept such evidence as conclusive of the value if the value
                        can otherwise be ascertained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Similarly, in <em>Chartered
                        Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 2
                    SLR(R) 1010 (“<em>Chartered
                    Electronics</em>”), a case that involved the conversion of
                    defective kits, our Court of Appeal at [18] sanctioned the use of market value
                    as a convenient way of calculating the value of the goods converted. However,
                    attention was drawn to the use of alternative ways to calculate the value of the
                    goods where there was no market for the goods converted. In this regard, the
                    appellate court observed at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on the principles espoused above with respect to the
                        calculation of the measure of damages, there were three alternatives in
                        determining the value of the defective kits:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)     firstly, the market value for
                            defective printer kits that could not be assembled into working
                            printers; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)     secondly, <em>if no
                                market existed</em>, the cost of replacing such defective
                            kits; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)     thirdly, if no such market existed to
                            replace the kits, the value would be determined by what the respondents
                            could obtain through a sale to a solvent buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As is obvious, the question is therefore what
                    is the value of the goods converted to be taken as? The starting point is to
                    look at the market value of the goods at the place and date of the conversion,
                    but that basis may yield to some other basis of valuation if the facts of the
                    case required it. Hence, examples are seen in cases where different valuations
                    are used. This is expected because of the particular kinds of property
                    converted. The type of evidence admissible to value the goods converted can vary
                    widely depending on whether the assessment is concerned with everyday
                    commodities, shares, business enterprises, specialised and rare items and items
                    for personal use such as clothing, jewellery and personal
                mementos.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     To illustrate, in <em>Mohammed
                        Idris Jabir v H A Jordan &amp; Co Ltd</em> [2010] EWHC 3465
                        (“<em>Idris Jabir</em>”), where a rare
                    pearl was converted, it was observed that the market in rare and costly pearls
                    was small and ultimate purchasers would be individuals both rich and discreet.
                    Unlike open markets of everyday commodities where prices are widely estimated
                    and advertised, the Judge there found that he was looking at a niche market
                    where the actual operating market that evidenced the value of the goods was
                    between informed and discreet buyers and sellers. Likewise, in <em>France v Gaudet</em> (1871) 6 QB 199 (“<em>France v Gaudet</em>”), the plaintiff there had agreed
                    to sell champagne that could not be replaced because the champagne of like
                    quality and description could not have been purchased in the market to enable
                    the plaintiff to fulfil his contract (see further at [69] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the final analysis, what is the appropriate
                    value of the goods converted in any particular case is thus a question of fact.
                    The inquiry commonly turns on the evidence adduced by parties and their ability
                    to prove or disprove the respective values asserted by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This brings me to the next preliminary point.
                    It has to do with the fair number of authorities cited by Mr Rajoo. Generally
                    speaking, the authorities were said to be either in support of or served to
                    illustrate Mr Rajoo’s submission as to how I should approach the
                    assessment of damages for conversion in this case in a manner desired by D2. I
                    make three points. First, parties and their counsel must be discerning in the
                    choice and use of authorities that are placed before the courts. It is never
                    wise to overburden the court with unnecessary material. Secondly, given the
                    fact-sensitive nature of the inquiry as to what the value of the goods converted
                    should be taken as, indiscriminate reliance on precedents and dicta tended to
                    obscure rather than illuminate the applicable principles. Thirdly, most of the
                    cases cited by Mr Rajoo that computed damages at the cost price of the converted
                    goods had very distinct factual matrices and therefore did not assist D2 at all
                    or even went against D2’s case (see [42] and [68]–[70]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having said all that, the point to note in the
                    final analysis is that the appropriate value to adopt in any particular case
                    depended on the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before coming to the first main issue between
                    the parties, it is convenient to dispose of Mr Rajoo’s singular contention
                    that this court should adopt the <em>Ewbank</em> approach
                    to assess damages on a basis different from the market value of the goods
                    converted at the date of the conversion (at [20] above). He argued that
                    “the factual matrix of <em>Ewbank</em> bears
                    similarities with the factual matrix in this [case] in that the cargo was
                    allegedly converted on the high seas and subsequently sold.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Mr Rajoo then cited <em>Clerk
                        &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (Michael A Jones gen ed) (Thomson Reuters
                    (Legal) Limited, 20th Ed, 2010) at para 17-97 that relied on <em>Ewbank</em> for the following proposition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In one case, where goods had been wrongfully sold in the course of a
                        voyage, the owner obtained as damages the cost price of the goods and the
                        freight paid and it was held that this was in the circumstances a proper
                        method of arriving at their value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Ewbank</em>, a
                    cargo of salt was converted in the course of the sea voyage and sold. The vessel
                    was damaged en route and the master sought refuge at Bahia, Brazil, where the
                    cargo of salt was sold to purportedly lighten the vessel. The sale was
                    unauthorised because it was not a sale by necessity to save the voyage. The
                    master and shipowner were found guilty of converting the salt. On the matter of
                    damages, the question raised there was this: what was the value of the cargo at
                    Bahia under the existing circumstances? Creswell J rhetorically asked at
                    805:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suppose the conversion had been by throwing the cargo overboard, what
                        would have been the measure of damage in that case? What would the cargo
                        have been worth to the owner?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>And in answering his own question, Cresswell J continued on the
                    same page:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">May we not reasonably conclude that the goods would be worth the invoice
                        price and the cost of carriage?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The supposition was that since
                    misappropriation took place at sea, the normal measure of damages that requires
                    determination of the market value at the place of conversion was patently
                    inappropriate. In that case, the invoice price and freight paid was used for
                    determining the value of the converted salt which was to be delivered to
                    Calcutta, India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Mr Rajoo’s submission that the basis of
                    assessment adopted in <em>Ewbank</em> would yield an
                    appropriate award on the facts in this case ignored two points. First, the
                    unauthorised sale of the salt was at Bahia and the issue there was the value of
                    the cargo at Bahia. Besides, in <em>Ewbank</em>, the only
                    evidence before the jury was the invoice price of the salt and the freight
                    charges to Calcutta. As noted by Wilde CJ at 809, the plaintiff in <em>Ewbank</em> had adduced no evidence at all of the existence
                    of a market for the salt in Calcutta, or the market value of the salt in that
                    regard, and “[t]he only materials that were laid before the jury, were,
                    proof of the cost price of the salt here, and the sum paid by the plaintiff on
                    account of the freight.” Creswell J also observed at 811:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not very well see how else the jury] could estimate the value of the
                        goods to the shipper, than by taking the cost price, and adding thereto the
                        expense incurred in getting them towards the merchant. What the cargo
                        fetched by a forced sale at Bahia clearly was no fair test. The plaintiff
                        did not want the goods there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although the value of the goods at the port of
                    delivery at the relevant time in <em>Ewbank</em> could not
                    be determined, Creswell J was suggesting the possibility that such a value would
                    have been a viable option if evidence was led to prove it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Secondly, for goods converted at sea, the
                    value of the goods should be determined at the place of delivery where delivery
                    up of possession of the goods ought to have taken place. In this regard, the
                    Privy Council in <em>The “Jag Shakti”</em>
                    [1985-1986] SLR(R) 448 (“<em>The Jag
                    Shakti</em>”) held as follows (at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So far as the first question is concerned, it is not in dispute that the
                        pledgee of a bill of lading is entitled, on presentation of it to the ship
                        at the port of discharge, to the possession of the goods represented by it.
                        It has further, in their Lordships' opinion, been established, by authority
                        of long standing, that where one person, A, who has or is entitled to have
                        the possession of goods, is deprived of such possession by the tortuous
                        conduct of another person, B, whether such conduct consists in conversion or
                        negligence, the <em>proper measure in law of the damages
                            recoverable by A from B is the full market value of the goods at the
                            time when and the place where possession of them should have been
                            given</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     That the market value of the goods converted
                    should be based on the time and place of delivery accords with the general rule
                    that FSPL should be placed in the same position as though the goods were not
                    converted, <em>ie</em> as though they were actually
                    delivered to and FSPL took possession of them at Port Blair at the expected time
                    of delivery. In the present case, the value of the cargo should therefore
                        <em>prima facie</em> be based upon the market value of
                    the cargo at Port Blair during the first week of October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     D2’s fall-back argument was that there
                    was no such market value of the cargo which the court could utilise in valuing
                    the cargo despite the evidence adduced by FSPL. It advanced two main submissions
                    to this effect: (a) that there was no market for river sand at Port Blair at the
                    relevant time; and (b) that FSPL’s evidence was insufficient for
                    ascertaining the market value. Notably, D2 led no countervailing evidence and
                    D2’s submissions were plainly argumentative in its bid to poke holes in
                    FSPL’s case. I shall deal with each issue in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence of market for river sand at Port Blair</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I begin by stating that I was satisfied that
                    FSPL’s evidence supported the existence of a market for river sand at Port
                    Blair in the first week of October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     By definition, there is a market for a
                    particular chattel if there is a willing seller and willing buyer after
                    negotiations. Furthermore, an available market value implies not only a willing
                    buyer, but a willing seller. However, the converse situation is not necessarily
                    true — absence of evidence of market value of a particular chattel does
                    not equate or mean that there is no market for that particular chattel. From
                    this perspective, there is a difference between a finding that there is an
                    available market for the goods converted and a finding as to the exact market
                    value of the goods converted. This difference is crystal clear when one compares
                    every day commodities with a rare article where there is no published or
                    advertised price and where the circle of sellers and buyers is small (see for
                    example <em>Idris Jabir</em> at [27] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The AR appeared to have equated an absence of
                    evidence of market value as sufficient evidence of no market for river sand at
                    Port Blair in the first week of October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     
          <em>The Endurance</em> 1
                    [1998] 3 SLR (R) 970, which was cited by Mr Rajoo to support a finding that
                    there was no market for river sand in this case, made clear that evidence must
                    be led to show that no market existed at the relevant time and place. In that
                    case, which dealt with the conversion of used water-makers, the Court of Appeal
                    disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that there was no market for used
                    water-makers and held that it was wrong to infer that there was no market from a
                    finding that “there was no current market price for used
                    water-makers” (see <em>Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd v The
                        Owners of The Ship or Vessel “Endurance 1” ex Tokai
                        Maru</em> [1998] SGHC 160 at [57]). The Court of Appeal held at
                    [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The owners submit that the learned judge was wrong to have proceeded on
                        the basis that there was no market for the water-makers at the time of the
                        conversion which was when the vessel was withdrawn from the charter.
                            <em>No evidence was led to this effect</em>. The
                        owners also submit that the cost of replacement should take into account
                        depreciation of the water-makers at the time of conversion. We agree with
                        these submissions. In our view the damages payable for the conversion of the
                        two water-makers should be reassessed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     From this extract, the Court of Appeal agreed
                    with the owner’s submission that the trial judge was wrong in finding that
                    there was no market for the converted goods since “[n]o evidence was led
                    to this effect” at the trial below. It is also clear that the evidential
                    burden shifts to the party asserting the absence of a market. Notably, D2 did
                    not adduce any evidence in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Evidence was led by FSPL to show that river
                    sand was “available” in Port Blair. FSPL’s evidence, in the
                    form of Fairmacs Trading’s invoices for the sale of river sand at Port
                    Blair for the first week of October 2011, was proof that there was a market with
                    willing buyers and sellers of river sand. Further, Mr Loganathan testified at
                    the assessment of damages that there were other sellers of river sand at Port
                    Blair and that they were competitors of FSPL and Fairmacs Trading. His testimony
                    was not challenged by D2. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     However, D2, in argument attempted to
                    undermine FSPL’s evidence as to the existence of a market for river sand
                    at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011. D2 raised two arguments. The
                    first was the absence of a market price index for river sand at Port Blair. The
                    second was the fact that based on Mr Loganathan’s testimony, it would take
                    a minimum of 20 to 25 days for any seller of river sand to deliver the goods to
                    Port Blair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I disagreed with D2’s first contention.
                    I am mindful that a market price index that tracks the changes in the price of a
                    particular commodity over time is one way of demonstrating the market price and
                    that it is indicative of the existence of an available market. However, the
                    converse situation is not necessarily true. It is worth nothing that only
                    certain commodity markets rely on market price indices to do business or trade.
                    I interpreted the evidence before me as follows: that river sand is not a
                    commodity whose pricing is defined by a market price index at Port Blair and
                    nothing more. Hence, it was wrong to regard the absence of a market price index
                    as evidence of no market and evidence of no market value for river sand at Port
                    Blair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I now come to D2’s second objection that
                    arose from Mr Loganathan’s testimony that sellers would have taken a
                    minimum of 20 to 25 days to deliver the equivalent 4,300 mt of river sand to
                    Port Blair.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> D2 had
                    argued that the amount of time required for such a delivery (<em>ie</em>, 20 to 25 days) meant that river sand could not be
                    “readily bought” at Port Blair in the first week of October
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     D2 relied on the case of <em>J
                        &amp; E Hall Ltd v Barclay</em> [1937] 3 All ER 620 (“<em>J &amp; E Hall</em>”) to support its argument that the
                    goods have to be “readily” available. Greer LJ in <em>J &amp; E Hall</em> said at 623:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where you are dealing with goods which can be readily bought in the
                        market, a man whose rights have been interfered with is never entitled to
                        more than what he would have to pay to buy a similar article in the
                        market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Notably, J &amp; E Hall was unique as it
                    concerned experimental davits that had to be manufactured, and the finding in
                    that case that there was no market was premised on the fact that there were no
                    “ready made” goods that could be bought which meant that the goods
                    in question could not have been purchased in the first place. That case
                    therefore did not address the issue as to delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In this regard, FSPL relied on the definition
                    of “available market” in the context of s 50(3) of the Sale
                    of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed) as described in <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (Michael G Bridge gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2014) at para 16-066:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that the courts are likely to eschew formal limitations on
                        the meaning of “available market”, especially in light of the
                        fact that the concept provides only a <em>prima
                            facie</em> measure of damages … the availability of buyers
                        and sellers, and their ready capacity to supply or to absorb the relevant
                        goods is the basic concept of an “available market”: It is
                        submitted that there is no need to add to this the test of a price liable to
                        fluctuations in accordance with supply and demand, as occurs in official
                        exchanges or certain commodity markets. … A fluctuating market price
                        indicates the existence of an available market, but it should not be a
                        necessary test, “there must be sufficient traders, who are in touch
                        with each other”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The market price rule and the concept of an
                    available market are straightforward in the sale of goods context. Like the
                    measure of damages for conversion, the market price rule accords with the
                    principle that the plaintiff is entitled to have his loss vindicated as at the
                    date of the breach/loss. The concept of an available market is therefore not
                    confined to the sale of goods context and may be applied by analogy to the
                    measure of damages for conversion. I therefore agreed with FSPL’s reliance
                    on the definition of “available market” in the sale of goods
                    context to this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Availability of goods in the market is not
                    measured by the length of time it to takes to deliver goods. <em>Garnac Grain Company Incorporated v HMF Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd and
                        others</em> [1968] 1 AC 1130 concerned a claim against a seller for
                    failure to deliver 15,000 tonnes of lard. As Lord Pearson explained at
                    1138:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, it was contended that no assessment could properly be made on the
                        basis of the difference between the contract price and the market price on
                        February 4, 1964 (or any other date that might be material), because there
                        was then no market in the United Kingdom for 15,000 tons of lard for
                        immediate delivery, and the evidence did not reveal any other basis for
                        assessing damages. There was evidence that at all material times (towards
                        the end of January and early in February, 1964) you could not buy that
                        quantity for immediate delivery in the United Kingdom. There was, however,
                        evidence that you could buy smaller quantities - up to 2,000 tons at a time
                        - in the U.S.A. for delivery to ports for shipment to the United Kingdom;
                        and there was a market price, given by one witness as 242.50 and by another
                        witness as 243.60 dollars per ton, for such purchases on February 4. If you
                        wished to buy 15,000 tons at those prices you would have to do so over a
                        period. According to one witness, if you were able to buy 15,000 tons of
                        lard at one time you would have to pay a higher price. There was thus some
                        evidence on which Megaw J. could find that there was a market price and that
                        it was 242.50 dollars per ton on February 4. No argument to the effect that
                        there was no market price proved was presented at the trial of the action.
                        No such point was included in the "respondents' notice" given by Garnac to
                        the Court of Appeal. It may have been raised in the Court of Appeal, but it
                        is not mentioned in the judgments. In these circumstances I do not think the
                        finding of fact of Megaw J. on this point can be successfully
                        challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In that case, the goods in question need not
                    be purchased immediately or delivered immediately. Immediate delivery was not a
                    necessary condition for establishing a market. Although the House of
                    Lord’s decision related to a breach of contract for the sale of goods, a
                    similar approach applies to wrongful conversion, and as I had explained at [51]
                    above, there was no reason for me to distinguish between definitions of
                    “market” when it comes to these different claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In this regard, there was no merit in Mr
                    Rajoo’s second argument that a delay of three weeks or thereabouts
                    warranted a finding that there was no market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For these reasons, I disagreed with the AR and
                    instead concluded on the evidence that there was a market for river sand at Port
                    Blair where FSPL could have readily bought the equivalent 4,300 mt of river
                    sand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence of market value</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I now turn to the value of the converted
                    cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It was not disputed that the burden of proof
                    was on FSPL to establish the relevant market value of river sand at Port Blair.
                    FSPL explained that US$46.85 pmt was the best evidence it could derive for the
                    value of river sand at Port Blair in the first week of October
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     D2’s objection to the US$46.85 pmt
                    market value adduced in evidence by FSPL was on the premise that it was based on
                    the retail price and not the wholesale price of river sand. D2 argued
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_i"></a>(i)     The figure of US$46.85 pmt was based
                        on the sale of much lower volumes of river sand as compared to the cargo;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The
                        figure of US$46.85 pmt included the profit which Fairmacs Trading would have
                        made given that Fairmacs Trading was selling to third parties and that the
                        figure of US$46.85 was substantially higher than the actual cost price of
                        the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     D2 argued that the AR had relied on the same
                    reasons in his decision to conclude that there was insufficient evidence as to
                    the relevant market value of river sand at Port Blair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Typically, where precise evidence of the value
                    of goods converted are obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it, but
                    where it is not the court must do the best it can: per Devlin J in <em>Biggin &amp; Co Ld v Permanite, Ld</em> [1951] 1 KB 422
                    at 438 whose view was cited and adopted in <em>Robertson Quay
                        Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 623 (“<em>Robertson Quay
                    Investment</em>”) at [30]. By doing the best it can, the court may
                    have regard to a variety of evidence. As I had observed in <em>Yip Holdings Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 1
                    SLR 131 (“<em>Yip Holdings</em>”) at
                    [39]–[40]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    I now come to what
                            evidence the court can take into consideration if there is no meaningful
                            market value. The commentary in para 14.11, <em>Butterworth's Law of Damages</em> ([13] <em>supra</em>) is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... [W]here there is otherwise no meaningful market value, the court
                            must attempt as best it can to value what was lost, or rather to
                            determine what it was worth to the claimant. For these purposes the
                            admissible evidence ranges widely. Courts have taken into account
                            original cost less depreciation, evidence of earnings (in the case of a
                            chattel such as a ship), insurance appraisals, bona fide offers, sales
                            of similar chattels or agreed resale prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    Another suggestion
                            that is instructive is gathered from Coleman J's observations in
                                <em>Derby Resources</em> (at
                            416–417):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There may be cases where the probative value of market prices at
                            different place or at different dates is weak but where the monetary
                            value of the goods indicated by that evidence can be corroborated by
                            other evidence from the place of delivery at the time of delivery with
                            the result that on the whole of the evidence the court can reach a
                            conclusion. It is, however, important to keep in mind that the purpose
                            of the exercise is to ascertain the objective monetary value of the
                            goods, not their utility to the receiver in the circumstances peculiar
                            to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It should also be noted that the range of evidence is wide and
                    other probative types of evidence not stated in the passage above may be
                    considered. In this case, Fairmacs Trading’s invoices constituted evidence
                    in the form of “sales of similar chattels”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In short, the market value of the goods
                    converted, or any other value asserted, must be proven with reasonable certainty
                    by showing sufficient evidence to enable the court to reach a fair and
                    reasonable approximation of damages. I pointed out in <em>Yip
                        Holdings</em> at [38] that the impossibility of laying down any
                    definitive rule as to what might constitute adequate proof meant that, in
                    practical terms, a court would have to carry out assessment of damages in a
                    flexible manner as regards what would be adequate proof of damage so as to
                    achieve the purpose of compensatory damages. A flexible approach towards a
                    plaintiff’s proof of damages was explained in <em>Robertson
                        Quay Investment</em> at [27]–[28] and [30]–[31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    ... [I]t is fundamental and trite that a
                        plaintiff claiming damages must prove his damage. ... The process of proving
                        damage is an intensely factual one. … In the circumstances, it is
                        impossible to lay down any <em>general</em> rules or principles as to what constitutes adequate
                        proof of damages since the <em>particular</em> factual circumstances can take, literally, a
                        myriad of forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The law, however,
                            does not demand that the plaintiff prove with complete certainty the
                            exact amount of damage that he has suffered. Thus, the learned author
                                of <em>McGregor on
                            Damages</em> continues as follows (at para
                        8-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the
                            fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage
                            is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As
                            Vaughan Williams L.J. put it in <em>Chaplin v
                                Hicks</em> [1911] 2 KB 786], the leading case on the
                            issue of certainty: "The fact that damages cannot be assessed with
                            certainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of paying
                                damages." <em>Indeed if absolute certainty were
                                required as to the precise amount of loss that the claimant had
                                suffered, no damages would be recovered at all in the great number
                                of cases. This is particularly true since so much of damages claimed
                                are in respect of prospective, and therefore necessarily contingent,
                                loss</em>. [emphasis added]</p>

                            certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the case and the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I now turn to the state of the evidence at the
                    appeal. FSPL accepted that it could not give precise evidence of the market
                    value of the river sand at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011.
                    Notably, D2 took issue with the value adduced by FSPL, but D2’s witness
                    was unable to provide contrary evidence of its own. D2’s witness, Mr Lau
                    Chong Hon (“Mr Lau”), the former Technical Superintendent of D2,
                    was not a satisfactory witness. His testimony as to the market value of the
                    cargo was entirely hearsay based upon his “conversations with the buyer
                    and the seller.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I therefore
                    gave no weight at all to his claim that the price of the river sand was between
                    S$7 to S$7.50 pmt<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     D2 urged this court to assess damages at the
                    cost of replacement applied by the AR because the market value of the cargo was
                    not ascertainable given the issues D2 took with FSPL’s evidence. In my
                    view, this was once again an attempt by D2 to undermine FSPL’s evidence
                    without adducing any countervailing evidence of its own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Having found that there was a market in Port
                    Blair for river sand, the next step was for this court to endeavour to ascertain
                    the market value of river sand. I did not agree with D2 that the market value of
                    river sand was, on the evidence, unascertainable. It was open to this court to
                    evaluate FSPL’s evidence to see if there was sufficient information to
                    establish the likely value of the cargo. In my analysis and evaluation of the
                    evidence in this particular case, there was adequate proof of the market value
                    of the cargo in the form of Fairmacs Trading’s invoices and Mr
                    Logonathan’s testimony, which I accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I pause here to refer to some of the cases
                    cited by Mr Rajoo. The cases showed that typically, courts would move away from
                    the market value in their assessment of damages for conversion where there was
                    effectively no evidence at all of a market or market value, and for that reason,
                    replacement cost was used. This approach was evident in <em>Ewbank</em>, a case cited by Mr Rajoo which I have already dealt with
                    (at [31]–[37] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The next case cited by D2 was <em>Fairfax Gerrard Holdings Ltd v Capital Bank plc</em> [2007] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 171 (“<em>Fairfax</em>”).
                    In that case, the plaintiff was in the business of trade finance and it sued the
                    defendant for conversion of a machine which it had intended to sell on to a
                    customer. The sale price was to be £175,000 whereas the purchase price of
                    the machine in China was £87,227.41. Mr Rajoo, in particular, relied on
                    this portion of Justice Mackie QC’s decision at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Casement cited <em>Hall v
                        Barclay</em> [1937] 3 All ER 620 a case where the Court of Appeal
                        held that a claimant recovering damages for conversion was entitled to the
                        market price but, where there was none, the cost of replacement. In the
                        course of his judgment Greer LJ said "where you are dealing with goods which
                        can be readily bought in the market, a man whose rights have been interfered
                        with is never entitled to more than what he would have to pay to buy a
                        similar article in the market. That rule has been enacted on over and over
                        again …" But for the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Kuwait</em> I would have followed this guidance and
                        ordered a figure closer to the price paid for the machine to the
                        manufacturer in China. A more flexible approach does it seems to me to
                        enable of the court to do better justice …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mr Rajoo was keen to rely on the fact that
                    Justice Mackie QC had decided to value the machine at a “figure closer to
                    the price paid for the machine to the manufacturer in China” as support
                    for his proposition that a value closer to the cost price of the cargo should be
                    adopted. This, unfortunately, was an inaccurate reading of the case. Justice
                    Mackie QC had in fact fixed damages at £132,500, a midpoint between the
                    contractual sale price of the machine and the purchase price of the machine
                    (which was actually closer to the contractual sale price) — he had not
                    fixed damages at a value closer to the purchase price. Justice Mackie QC was in
                    fact faced with the problem of determining the market value of the machine given
                    that the contractual sale price of the machine was not reflective of the market
                    value. In the passage above, he had in fact acknowledged the decision in
                        <em>J &amp; E Hall</em> which stated that in the
                    absence of an ascertainable market value he should award the cost of
                    replacement. However, he found that he would have ordered a figure closer to the
                    purchase price “[b]ut for” the House of Lords decision in
                        <em>Kuwait Airways Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (nos 4 and
                        5)</em> [2002] 2 AC 833 which called for flexibility in the assessment
                    of damages. In this regard, Justice Mackie QC exercised this flexibility in
                    favour of the plaintiff and ordered a figure closer to the contractual sale
                    price, taking into consideration (at [42]) that the plaintiff had no desire to
                    obtain another like machine and that it had only been interested in the benefits
                    to be accrued from the one-time sale of the converted machine. This decision, in
                    fact, supported FSPL’s case here since it showed that the cost price of
                    the goods converted is not necessarily the alternative in the event that the
                    market value is extremely difficult to ascertain, and that the sale price of the
                    goods converted may be considered as well in quantifying damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The third authority on D2’s list was
                        <em>Chua Keng Mong v Hong Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1993] 3
                    SLR (R) 317. In that case, Goh Joon Seng J awarded the cost of replacement of
                    the goods lost in the fire caused by the defendants’ negligence. Notably,
                    Goh J actually found at [33] that “[o]n the evidence, the prices of [the
                    goods lost] at the date of the loss and of the hearing were about the same as
                    the prices paid for by the plaintiff”. It was therefore clear that Goh J
                    awarded the cost of replacement of the goods because it was equivalent to the
                    market value of the goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Lastly, there was the case of <em>France v Gaudet</em> which I have discussed above at [27]. I
                    make three points here. First, that case concerned champagne of a particular
                    quality and description, unlike river sand in this case which was a more
                    homogenous commodity. Secondly, in that case, the English Court of Appeal had
                    assessed damages based upon what the plaintiff would have obtained from a sale
                    of the goods converted to a solvent buyer, the third alternative listed by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Chartered Electronics</em> (see [25]
                    above), not the cost price. Thirdly, Mellor J also noted (at 204) that the
                    plaintiff in that case had admitted that “champagne of the like quality
                    and description could not have been purchased in the [open] market”. In
                    this case, there was no similar admission by FSPL who instead adduced evidence
                    to prove the market value of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I now turn to D2’s complaint that the
                    value of US$46.85 pmt was significantly higher than the cost price of the cargo,
                    namely US$22.30 pmt. First, this disparity could easily be explained on the
                    basis that the markets from which those values were derived were different.
                    Secondly, even if US$46.85 pmt included profits made by Fairmacs Trading, they
                    were profits made by Fairmacs Trading, or any other potential competitor, and
                    not FSPL itself. There was no element of windfall to FSPL to begin with.
                    Thirdly, as a matter of principle, if required by the particular facts of the
                    case, the court may, even in the absence of a market value, nonetheless
                    ascertain the value of the goods converted at a value higher than the
                    plaintiff’s purchase price of the goods converted as was done in <em>Fairfax</em> (see [66]–[67] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As for the contention that US$46.85 pmt was
                    based on the sale of much lower volumes of river sand as compared to the bulk
                    purchase of 4,300 mt of the cargo, D2 did not adduce any countervailing evidence
                    of the applicable rate in the case of a bulk sale whereas Mr Loganathan had, in
                    his testimony, at least attempted to explain the reasons why there would be no
                    significant pricing difference.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan had also pointed out that
                    FSPL faced difficulty in gathering additional information as to the market value
                    of river sand at Port Blair. Its other source of information would have been
                    other sellers of river sand who were the competitors of Fairmacs Trading and it
                    was understandable that competitors would loathe cooperating with FSPL by
                    revealing their pricing to FSPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For these reasons, I accepted the market value
                    of US$46.85 pmt in its entirety based on the evidence adduced by FSPL. However,
                    that was not the end of the matter as there was still the matter of other
                    expenses that would have to be considered at the place of delivery of the cargo,
                    which I will now come to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Deductions from the market value of the cargo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It was raised at the hearing of the appeal
                    that the cargo was supposed to be delivered at anchorage, Port Blair. As such, a
                    discount should be applied to the rate of US$46.85 pmt. Mr Loganathan testified
                    that if the cargo was delivered at Port Blair at the expected time of delivery,
                    FSPL would have had to pay 5% of the value of US$46.85 pmt in the form of
                    customs duty and 8% to 10% of the same value in the form of further expenses
                    incurred for landing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Mr Tan argued that the court should not
                    discount those additional expenses that FSPL would have had to incur had the
                    cargo been delivered to Port Blair. Mr Tan relied on <em>The Jag
                        Shakti</em> for the proposition that the damages recoverable by the
                    claimant whose goods were converted during the course of the voyage should be
                    the “full market value” of the goods at the time of delivery (see
                    [36] above). He referred to [13] of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… For this purpose it is irrelevant whether A has the general
                        property in the goods as the outright owner of them, or only a special
                        property in them as pledgee, or only possession or a right to possession of
                        them as a bailee. Furthermore the circumstance that, if A recovers the full
                        market value of the goods from B, he may be liable to account for the whole
                        or part of what he has recovered to a third party, C, is also irrelevant, as
                            being <em>res inter alios acta</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mr Tan therefore submitted that any expenses
                    which FSPL would have incurred if the cargo was delivered should only form the
                    subject matter of an account of such sums to the relevant third party —
                    such expenses should still constitute part of the damages awarded to FSPL in
                    this present suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     FSPL’s analysis of <em>The Jag Shakti</em> was misunderstood and misapplied. The passage
                    quoted above discusses the entitlement of a party with an immediate right of
                    possession over the goods converted to claim for the full value of the goods
                    instead of being limited to the value of his possessory interest. However, he
                    would be required to account to the party with proprietary interest in the goods
                    for the difference. The “full value” described in the <em>Jag Shakti</em> has to be understood in this context, and not
                    in the erroneous manner explained by Mr Tan. In the present case, there was no
                    question that FSPL was the owner of the cargo and that it sued as owner and
                    consignee of the cargo. Whilst FSPL’s case was that its loss was the
                    “full market value” of the cargo, the latter value, however,
                    included the expenses for clearing the cargo from the port area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I was therefore of the view that since the
                    cargo was to be delivered at anchorage, the market value of the cargo in situ at
                    anchorage should reflect deductions for customs duty and landing charges in
                    order to arrive at a fair award of damages. I therefore deducted 15% (5% customs
                    and 10% landing costs) from the value of US$46.85 pmt to arrive at a figure of
                    US$39.82 pmt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I also took into consideration the sum of
                    US$30,000 being freight that would have to be paid by FSPL to Marine Alliance
                    upon the delivery of the cargo at Port Blair. This freight was not paid because
                    of the conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Accordingly, I awarded damages at US$141,226
                    being the value of the cargo converted by D2 after deducting US$30,000. The
                    computation is as follows: US$171,226 (US$39.82 pmt x 4,300 mt) minus US$30,000.
                    In broad terms, the sum of US$141,226 was what FSPL should receive for its
                    proprietary interest in the cargo that was sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other matters</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     D2 argued that FSPL should have mitigated its
                    loss by purchasing an equivalent volume of river sand after the conversion. D2
                    asserted that FSPL would have only incurred the purchase price of the cargo if
                    it did so. In making this submission, D2 relied on the authority of the decision
                    in <em>The Endurance 1</em> where the Court of Appeal held
                    at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where there is a market the charterers are expected to diminish the damage
                        by going into the market and buying the water-makers in the market, so as to
                        put themselves in the position they would have been if they had not suffered
                        any wrong at all. If there is no market for the goods converted, the measure
                        of damages would be the cost of replacement and the charterers must go to
                        their suppliers to purchase the water-makers so as to put themselves in the
                        same position as if they would have if not for the conversion
                            (see <em>Hall v Barclay</em> [1937] 3 All
                        ER 620).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I dismissed D2’s submissions on
                    mitigation for the following reasons: First, mitigation of damages as a defence
                    must be properly pleaded and proved. D2’s pleadings did not put this
                    defence of mitigation of damages in issue. The pleadings therefore contravened
                    the established procedural rule that an assertion that the plaintiff had failed
                    to mitigate its loss must be pleaded and proved by the defendant relying on it:
                    see <em>Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 at [71]. In particular, I reiterated in
                        <em>Yip Holdings</em> [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no gainsaying the importance of a specific plea of mitigation of
                        damages as a defence following the restatement of the principles of
                        mitigation by the Court of Appeal in <em>The Asia
                            Star</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1154. For present purposes, V K Rajah JA
                        (delivering the judgment of the court), inter alia, observed at [24]:
                        (a) mitigation of damages involves an inquiry as to the reasonableness of
                        the innocent party's action or inaction after the breach, and (b) ordinarily
                        it is the defendant's burden of proving that the innocent party had failed
                        to take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss, and that the burden is not
                        one that is easily discharged. In his overview of the law relating to
                        mitigation of damages, Rajah JA pointed out at [31] that whilst the standard
                        of reasonableness is said to be an objective one, it also takes into account
                        subjective circumstances such as the aggrieved party's financial position.
                        Accordingly, the reasonableness inquiry falls short of being purely an
                        objective one. Furthermore, since the question of mitigation is a question
                        of fact, and the circumstances in which the plaintiff was placed by the
                        breach dictated its action or inaction, they would be matters of materiality
                        that must be pleaded with as much particularity as would be required in the
                        circumstance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Secondly, D2’s submission that FSPL
                    failed to mitigate its damages did not consider the fact that the reason why the
                    plaintiff did not purchase an equivalent amount of river sand after the
                    conversion was mostly due to the fact that the defendants had ignored
                    FSPL’s inquiries as to the whereabouts of the cargo and had kept FSPL in
                    the dark. When FSPL commenced the present action, the relief it sought was for
                    delivery up of the cargo. By the time FSPL was made aware that the cargo had
                    been sold by D2, it was already 28 December 2011 (see [9] above) and nearly
                    three months after the expected period of delivery of the cargo. D2 filed its
                    defence without pleading mitigation as a defence and its assertion that FSPL
                    should have mitigated its damages by purchasing an equivalent amount of river
                    sand was plainly a non-starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Thirdly, D2’s mitigation arguments were
                    lacking in detail and evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations on the existence of an alternative remedy </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Claims to waive the tort to seek recovery of
                    the sale proceeds received by the defendant or to recover damages for the goods
                    converted are well established. As explained in Harvey McGregor, <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)
                    at para 12-016:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from using the claimant’s goods, a defendant may dispose of
                        them by sale. It is worth remembering that it has been accepted for three
                        hundred years, since <em>Lamine v Dorrell</em>, that
                        the claimant may claim the price at which the defendant sold. Should this
                        sale be at a favourable price, one that is above the market value of the
                        goods at the time of conversion which marks the claimant’s loss, this
                        recovery can be looked at as essentially one of restitutionary damages,
                        although of course in those days we were in the very different world of
                            <em>indebitatus assumpsit</em> and
                        quasi-contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The decision in <em>Lamine v
                        Dorrell</em> (1790) 2 Raym Ld 1216 cited by McGregor in the passage
                    above was also followed Lai Kew Chai J in <em>Schindler Lifts
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd v People’s Park Chinatown Development Pte Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 583 at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 25 August 1988 the plaintiffs filed this originating summons which was
                        heard before me on 16 and 18 May 1989 at the conclusion of which I made the
                        declarations and the orders I mentioned earlier in this judgment. I ordered
                        the defendants to pay over the proceeds of the goods <em>in lieu</em> of damages for conversion in accordance with
                        what was decided in <em>Lamine</em> <em>v Dorrell</em> (1790) 92 ER 303. That case laid down
                        the proposition that where a man takes goods to which he has no right and
                        sells them, the owner may waive the tort of conversion, and recover the
                        price for which they were sold in an <em>indebitatus
                            assumpsit</em> for money had and received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     From the passage quoted above, when a
                    conversion consists of a wrongful sale of the goods converted, the owner of the
                    goods may elect to claim from the defendant the price which the defendant
                    obtained for them, as money received by the defendant for the use of the
                    plaintiff. The law allows the plaintiff to “waive” the tort
                    thereby ratifying the defendant’s conduct to create a quasi-contractual
                    relationship which would allow the plaintiff to sue the defendant for money had
                    and received for the plaintiff’s use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The House of Lords in <em>United Australia Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd</em> [1941] 1 AC 1
                    recognised that the waiver of tort doctrine enabled recovery of the sale
                    proceeds as a choice of two remedies against the wrongdoer in the context of
                    proprietary torts. Thus, there was no requirement for the plaintiff to waive a
                    tort claim or ratify the defendant’s tortuous conduct. In short, the
                    plaintiff does not have to “waive” the tort, rather, he pursues
                    the tort claim and then elects to waive the remedy of damages, claiming instead
                    the defendant’s wrongfully obtained benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Lord Romer in his speech said at 34:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person whose goods have been wrongfully converted by another has the
                        choice of two remedies against the wrongdoer. He may sue for the proceeds of
                        the conversion as money had and received to his use or he may sue for
                        damages that he has sustained by the conversion. If he obtains judgment for
                        the proceeds, it is certain that he is precluded from thereafter claiming
                        damages for the conversion. But, in my opinion, this is not due to his
                        having waived the tort but to his having finally elected to pursue one of
                        his two alternative remedies. The phrase "waive the tort" is a picturesque
                        one. It has a pleasing sound. Perhaps it was for these reasons that it was
                        regarded with so much affection by the old Common Lawyers, one of whom,
                        indeed, was moved to break into verse upon the subject. But with all respect
                        to their memories, I firmly believe that the phrase was an inaccurate one if
                        and so far as it meant that the tortious act was affirmed. What was waived
                        by the judgment was not the tort, but the right to recover damages for the
                        tort. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The doctrine of alternative remedies, as
                    described by Lord Romer above, calls for consideration of the principles
                    governing election between remedies. Generally, a plaintiff is not required to
                    choose before judgment is given between the two alternative remedies which he
                    may pursue in his proceedings that rely on the same pleading of the same tort on
                    the facts. In other words, he may claim both remedies as
                alternatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Whether the redress in question is viewed as a
                    claim for money had and received or an election between remedies, I will leave
                    this debate for resolution on another occasion. Suffice it to say that a more
                    modern way of putting this alternative remedy of money had and received is, as
                    is described in <em>McGregor</em> (at [84] above), that the
                    plaintiff seeks restitutionary damages for a wrong at common law rather than the
                    more usual compensatory damages. This alternative remedy is attractive from an
                    evidential view point: it is easier to prove the sum the defendant had received
                    for the sale than to establish the market price of the goods in
                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this case, FSPL did not know how much D2
                    had sold the cargo for and that affected FSPL’s choice of
                remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     For the reasons given above, I allowed
                    FSPL’s appeal. I awarded FSPL the sum of US$141,226 in damages and
                    interest thereon at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ of
                    Summons to the date of payment. I also awarded FSPL the costs of the appeal
                    since it succeeded on a substantial part of its claim (more than 50% of the
                    additional US$138,505 claimed) to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
