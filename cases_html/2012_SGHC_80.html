<p class="Judg-Author">
        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Parties were before me to determine certain
                    issues ancillary to their divorce. The husband discharged his lawyer after the
                    second hearing and represented himself thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant (“the husband”) is
                    an eye-surgeon with Australian citizenship; the plaintiff (“the
                    wife”) is an aesthetics doctor with Singapore citizenship. They are now
                    both in private practice with their own clinics. Their marriage began on 17 May
                    1986 and lasted for 23 years. They have a 19 year old daughter reading for an
                    undergraduate degree in England, and a 15 year old son studying at an
                    international school in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I will now summarise the orders I made on
                    6 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I ordered parties to be granted joint custody
                    over the children and granted the wife sole care and control with reasonable
                    access to the husband. The terms of access were to be worked out by the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As regards the division of matrimonial assets, I
                    granted the wife:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     20% of $1,323,655.19 being the
                        parties’ combined matrimonial assets (excluding sale proceeds of the
                        matrimonial home and of a property in Australia (“the Australia
                        house”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     39% of $886,887 being the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial home;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     5% of
                        $533,122.52 being the husband’s share of the sale proceeds of the
                        Australia house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The husband would be entitled to the
                    balance. Any sum to be paid by the husband to the wife arising from the division
                    of matrimonial assets may be set-off against his share of the sale proceeds of
                    the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       (a)I ordered the husband to pay the wife $1 per
                    month from 1 January 2010 for her own maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     I also ordered the husband to pay 60%
                        of the children’s maintenance. I determined the children’s
                        expenses (excluding school fees) in Singapore to be $2,000 per month and the
                        husband was to pay the wife 60% thereof amounting to $1,200 per month from
                        1 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The wife was to reimburse the husband for 40% of the school fees from
                        1 January 2009. She was also to reimburse the husband 40% of overseas
                        accommodation and living expenses of the daughter. He was to provide
                        reasonable documentary evidence of the school fees, accommodation and living
                        expenses to the wife. Any sum to be paid by the wife for reimbursement may
                        be set-off against her share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial
                        home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Each party was to bear his or her own costs of
                    these ancillary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The wife has filed an appeal against my decision
                    on the division of matrimonial assets and on maintenance for herself and for the
                    children. I set out my reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The children presently live with the wife
                    – the daughter when she is in Singapore. To their credit, the parties
                    appear to have worked out a mutually satisfactory arrangement that allows the
                    children to spend enough time with their father. It was in this context that the
                    husband agreed to give the wife sole care and control of the children with
                    reasonable access for himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I will deal first with the division of
                    matrimonial assets (not arising from the sale of real property) and, secondly,
                    the division of the sale proceeds from the matrimonial home. Thirdly, I will
                    discuss the division of the sale proceeds from a house in Australia. The goal
                    was to achieve a just and equitable result, taking into account the factors
                    listed in s 122 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev
                Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Matrimonial assets (not arising from the sale of real
                property)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The parties were able to agree on
                        $875,897.19<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> worth of matrimonial assets, held by either the
                    husband or the wife, by the third hearing on 9 January 2012. This sum
                    excluded a refund of $178,577.79 to the wife’s Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) account from the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home
                    which would be taken into account when such sale proceeds are dealt
                        with.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The parties were not able to agree on five
                    items of matrimonial assets. The first was the valuation of Clinic C, one of the
                    husband’s clinics.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The husband had
                    hired a professional accountant to value his shares in Clinic C. The
                    accountant’s report was dated 27 April 2011 and valued Clinic C at
                    $197,758 as at 4 November 2007 and $443,281 as at 12 May 2009. The former
                    valuation was based on Clinic C’s management accounts for the year ending
                    30 June 2008. The husband was initially happy to rely on this report in his
                    affidavit filed on 12 May 2011. At the second hearing on 12 October 2011, I was
                    informed by lawyers for the husband and wife that they had agreed to use
                    7 November 2007 (being the date the wife left the matrimonial home) as the
                    date to value the matrimonial assets. This meant that the parties were adopting
                    the figure of $197,758 for the value of Clinic C since that value was as at
                    4 November 2007, which was close enough to 7 November
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However at the fifth hearing of 6 March 2012,
                    the husband told me that the true valuation of Clinic C as at 4 November 2007
                    was $3,693 instead. He explained the difference of more than $190,000 on the
                    basis that Clinic C had taken out a loan to buy medical equipment soon after
                    4 November 2007. His business at Clinic C had also been very good from
                    after November 2007 onwards. So the accounts as of 30 June 2008, which had been
                    used to prepare the valuation, gave an inflated impression of the actual value
                    of Clinic C as at 4 November 2007. To support his position, the husband tried to
                    adduce a fresh accountant’s report prepared by the same accountant as
                    before. He said that the accountant had explained to him that it was standard
                    accounting practice to use the management accounts for the year ending 30 June
                    2008 to determine the value of Clinic C as at 4 November 2007, but he
                    disagreed that this was the correct approach. Hence the fresh report which was
                    allegedly based on the accounts as at 4 November 2007. Counsel for the wife, Ms
                    Loo, objected on the basis that the court should not look behind the earlier
                    accountant’s report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I denied the husband leave to admit the fresh
                    report. As already noted, the first valuation had been done by the
                    husband’s own accountant. The husband had been happy at the start to rely
                    on it. So had his former lawyer acting on his instructions. The husband said
                    that the figure of $197,758 was an alternative to the other valuation of
                    $449,781 as at 12 May 2009. He said he did not know that the court might adopt
                    the figure of $197,758. I was of the view that this was not a valid reason. That
                    figure was mentioned as an alternative for the court’s possible adoption.
                    Accordingly I based the value of Clinic C on the accountant’s report of 27
                    April 2011, this value being $197,758.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second item of disputed matrimonial assets
                    related to the valuation of Clinic S, which was another of the husband’s
                        clinics.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The wife said its value was
                    $307,797.70, while the husband’s valuation of it was $214,199. At the
                    hearing on 9 January 2012, Ms Loo and the husband eventually agreed to the sum
                    of $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I should mention that although the wife has a
                    clinic owned through a company, Clinic L, this clinic started after
                    7 November 2007 which was the cut-off date which both counsel had agreed
                    upon to value the matrimonial assets, before the husband decided to represent
                    himself. Hence the wife’s clinic was not taken into account as part of the
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The third and fourth items in dispute were
                    respectively, the value of the husband’s company [H]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, and $39,337.47 held in Clinic C’s
                    account with OCBC bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    wife, the quantum of the third item was the relatively small sum of $2,866.80.
                    During the hearing on 9 January 2012, Ms Loo agreed to drop the claim to
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In relation to the sum held in Clinic
                    C’s bank account, the wife’s initial stand was that this sum had not
                    been taken into account by the accountant in his 27 April 2011 valuation.
                    However Ms Loo eventually accepted that the court should not look behind the
                    accountant’s valuation and confirmed on 6 March 2012 that the wife
                    would also not be pursuing her claim in relation to Clinic C’s bank
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The fifth item of dispute was the wife’s
                    credit card liabilities for October and November 2007, totalling
                        $9,155.36.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Ms Loo informed me on
                    9 January 2012 that these expenses had been incurred because the wife was
                    moving out of the matrimonial home. However when I looked at the respective
                    credit card statements, it was plain that the sum of $9,155.36 included expenses
                    for things as varied as groceries, eating at restaurants, internet
                    “friendfinder”, hairdressing, clothing, and charitable donations.
                    Neither was it immediately apparent which items of expenditure related directly
                    to the cost of moving out. I thus decided that it was not appropriate to take
                    into account these liabilities in determining the matrimonial
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Hence the total amount of matrimonial assets
                    was $1,323,655.19. Of this sum, $1,186,532.08 (89.6%) was held by the husband,
                    and $137,123.11 (10.4%) by the wife. I attach Annex A which contains details of
                    the matrimonial assets (excluding proceeds from the sale of real
                    property).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The wife asked to keep her share of the
                    matrimonial assets, and 30% of what the husband held. According to her, she had
                    made significant indirect financial contributions and non-financial
                    contributions to the family throughout the marriage. For example, she had
                    financially supported the family in Australia while the husband had been on a
                    specialist medical training course from 1990 – 1995, during which period
                    their daughter had been born. She had also done most of the housework by
                    herself. According to the wife she was also the primary caregiver of the two
                    children. She stopped working full-time after the birth of her daughter in 1992
                    in order to better take care of the family. She was in charge of the day-to-day
                    care of the children, eg, supervising their homework, taking them to school and
                    for medical appointments. She spent most of her free time with the children. She
                    denied socialising much and said that it was about four or five years after the
                    family had returned to Singapore and the children were older that she started to
                    go out with her friends. When the family moved to Singapore in 1995, she worked
                    part-time till 2007 when she started to work full-time. She said that she helped
                    to pay for the family’s expenses, although she admitted that the husband
                    paid for the bulk of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As regards the fact that the wife had left the
                    matrimonial home in November 2007, the wife said that the tension between the
                    husband and her was getting intolerable. She did not want her children to be
                    adversely affected especially before their major exams in 2008 for
                    ‘O’ levels and the primary school leaving exams respectively. She
                    said that she would call the children every other day to check on them. She also
                    wanted the children to stay with her on weekdays to spend time with them and
                    help with their schoolwork but the husband did not agree to this. It is not
                    disputed that the children went to live with her about 26 months later from
                    January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The husband submitted that each party should
                    keep 100% of the matrimonial assets already in his/her hands. His reason was
                    that both parties had invested equal amounts of non-financial contributions to
                    the marriage. Furthermore, he had paid for most of the household expenses. He
                    also gave evidence of his regular payments of $1,000 to $3,000 into a joint bank
                    account which he said had been used for household expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The husband did not accept the wife’s
                    assertions about her substantial non-financial contributions to the welfare of
                    the family. In particular, he stressed that she is a spendthrift and a
                    gregarious person and that over the years she became more interested in her
                    social life than in the family. This culminated with the wife leaving the
                    children with him in November 2007 when she left the matrimonial home and he was
                    happy to care for them. He disagreed that he had refused to let them stay with
                    her until January 2010. He obtained a report from a private investigator which
                    was submitted by the investigator to him on 15 April 2008. It showed that
                    over a period of a few days in December 2007, <em>ie</em>,
                    after the wife had left the matrimonial home, she was seen partying at two night
                    spots on two separate nights, one a weekday and another a weekend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It was clear that the main breadwinner in the
                    family had been the husband. He had provided a home and a comfortable life for
                    the family. I accepted that the wife was the primary caregiver of the children,
                    especially in their formative years. As a result the wife had to make certain
                    career sacrifices, but she did not give up her career entirely. I also accept
                    that there was some truth in the husband’s allegation that over the years
                    the wife became more interested in her social life. Furthermore, she left the
                    matrimonial home on 4 November 2007 and the husband was the
                    children’s caregiver for 26 months. I was of the view that she had no
                    valid reason for leaving the children with the husband if she had really wanted
                    to have them with her. The husband did not stop her from achieving any such
                    intention. However, as mentioned above, the children did live with her from
                    January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my opinion, it would be just and equitable
                    to award the wife 20% of the combined matrimonial assets of $1,323,655.19,
                        <em>ie</em>, $264,731.04. Since she held $137,123.11 of
                    such assets, the husband would have to pay her the balance, <em>ie</em>, $264,731.04 - $137,123.11 = $127,607.93.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale proceeds from the matrimonial home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The parties’ matrimonial home in
                    Singapore was bought in 1997 for $650,000, with a down payment of $126,000. The
                    dispute was on how much of the down payment the wife had paid. The wife’s
                    contention was not that she had contributed a specified sum towards the down
                    payment. Instead she argued that since there was no documentary evidence as to
                    who had paid for the down payment, a fair and broad brushed approach would be to
                    take both parties as having contributed equally to the down payment. Importantly
                    however, she had already acknowledged in Ms Loo’s written submissions (at
                    para 22) filed on 17 August 2011 that the husband had paid for a
                    significant portion of the down payment although there was no indication from
                    her as to how much of the down payment the husband had made. Given that
                    admission, I was of the view that she did not make half of the down payment, and
                    that it was just to conclude that the husband had paid the entire down
                    payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     If the wife had paid half of the down payment,
                    her direct financial contribution to acquire the matrimonial home would be
                        23.7%<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. She sought another 30% for her
                    non-financial contributions in the marriage, making a total of 53.7% of the net
                    sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the other hand, the husband’s
                    position was that the wife should receive only 20% of the net sale proceeds on
                    the basis that she did not contribute to the down payment. The husband’s
                    previous lawyer had submitted that if the wife had not contributed to the down
                    payment, then her direct financial contribution to acquire the matrimonial home
                    would be 19%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    During the hearing on 6 March 2012, Ms Loo confirmed that she did not
                    dispute this figure if I were to find, as I did, that the wife did not
                    contribute to the down payment. In addition, I awarded 20% for the wife’s
                    non-financial contributions, in particular her care of the children. Therefore I
                    awarded her a total of 39% of the net sale proceeds of $886,887. The net sale
                    proceeds comprised a $178,577.79 refund to her CPF account and $708,309.21 held
                    by certain solicitors as stakeholders. The 39% worked out to $345,885.93. As the
                    wife had already received $178,577.79 in her CPF account, she was entitled to
                    $167,308.14 from the stakeholders and the balance of the net sale proceeds was
                    to be paid to the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale proceeds from a house in Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The husband had bought the Australia house
                    with his sister in 1987 about one year after the parties’ marriage in May
                    1986. According to the husband, the Australia house had been rented out until
                    1994, and he had used the rent and his own money to service a loan secured by a
                    mortgage of the Australia house. The wife was working in Singapore at the time
                    of the purchase, and she went to live with him in Australia only in
                1989.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The husband said that he sold his half-share
                    in the Australia house to his parents for about A$275,000 in 1996, when he
                    decided to relocate to Singapore. However, on this point he was not entirely
                    consistent, as he also said at times that he sold the half-share to his father
                    only. To avoid stamp duty there was no formal transfer. The husband used the
                    money he received from the sale to partially pay for their matrimonial home in
                    Singapore. Around 2003 to 2004, the husband’s parents sold the Australia
                    house (the sister had sold them her half-share in 1989) for about A$1.15m to pay
                    for his mother’s medical bills. In order to better look after his parents,
                    the husband brought them over to Singapore and rented an apartment for them.
                    According to the husband, a sum equivalent to $533,122.52 was then deposited by
                    his parents into his bank account in Singapore to help defray his expenses in
                    looking after them. Subsequently, the sum was transferred back to his
                    father’s bank account in Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The husband’s version was challenged by
                    the wife. She said she had helped him to repay his share of the mortgage, but
                    was unable to provide any documentary evidence. She also claimed that the
                    husband never sold his interest in the Australia house to his parents in 1996,
                    and that the $533,122.52 in fact represented his portion of the proceeds of sale
                    in 2003 or 2004. The wife claimed half of the $533,122.52 which she said was a
                    matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There was insufficient evidence to support the
                    husband’s claim that he had sold his half-share in the Australia house to
                    his parents in 1996. Even though there was no formal transfer in 1996, one would
                    have expected some documents from the subsequent sale in 2003 or 2004 to suggest
                    that the parents were the sole beneficiaries of the Australia house. For
                    example, there could have been a letter to (or from) their Australian
                    professional advisors confirming that they had acted on the instructions of the
                    parents in the sale, or that they had been informed by the husband that the sale
                    proceeds belonged to the parents. There was no evidence as to whose account the
                    sale proceeds were initially credited into. Furthermore, there was no reason why
                    the parents could not open a bank account in Singapore in their own names to
                    transfer the sale proceeds. Accordingly, I was of the view that the husband did
                    retain a half-share in the Australia house, of which the $533,122.52 represented
                    his portion of the sale proceeds. The next question was whether the wife had any
                    claim to this money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I found that the wife had not proved her
                    direct financial contributions for the Australia house. She did not adduce any
                    documentary evidence and it was unlikely that she contributed to the payment of
                    any monthly instalment. The property was bought by the husband and his sister.
                    For the first two years after the Australia house was bought, the wife remained
                    in Singapore while the husband resided in Australia. Further, the parties did
                    not live in the Australia house even when the wife joined the husband in
                    Australia subsequently. In the circumstances I found it hard to accept the
                    wife’s word that she had helped to pay for the mortgage. There was also
                    hardly any evidence as to how her indirect contributions had assisted the
                    husband to acquire the Australia house. Nevertheless, the Australia house was
                    technically part of matrimonial assets because it was acquired by the husband
                    after the parties were married. In the circumstances, I awarded the wife 5% of
                    the $533,122.52, <em>ie</em>, $26,656.13.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I also ordered that any sum to be paid by the
                    husband to the wife arising from the division of matrimonial assets could be
                    set-off against his share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial
                home.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The wife initially asked for maintenance of
                    $10,000 per month for herself and the children, and for the husband to be solely
                    responsible for the children’s school fees (which was also referred to as
                    tuition fees). Eventually, the wife was prepared to bear her own living expenses
                    and those of her children while they lived with her in Singapore, if the husband
                    paid the school fees. As the daughter was studying in England and the son in a
                    local international school, the school fees added up to an estimated sum of
                    about $100,000 every year. On his part, the husband was not prepared to pay any
                    maintenance for the wife. As for the children, he initially suggested that the
                    parties bear the children’s expenses equally, including their school fees.
                    However, he was prepared to pay 55% with the wife paying 45%. This offer was
                    rejected by the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The wife was earning a substantial income and
                    her earning capacity was about equal to that of the husband’s. I will
                    elaborate on these points later. For the time being, I will just say that in
                    view of these points, I ordered the husband to pay her maintenance of $1 per
                    month from 1 January 2010 so as to keep alive her option of applying for a
                    variation in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The main dispute between the parties on the
                    issue of maintenance for the children was the school fees. As it was, the
                    children were studying in an international school in Singapore. The fees would
                    increase if the children were to study overseas as the daughter was now doing.
                    There would then be overseas accommodation and living expenses as
                well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Three reasons led me to conclude that it would
                    not be fair or equitable to make the husband solely responsible for the school
                    fees. The first reason was that the wife appeared to have played a part in
                    encouraging the children to attend an international school in Singapore. She
                    said in her first affidavit of assets and means filed on 30 April 2009 (at para
                    45(f)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Recently, both the children moved from the local system to [the
                        international school]. It was I who took the children to talk to a parent
                        whose child was attending [the international school] and got them interested
                        in continuing their education there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Yet the wife made a contrary allegation in her
                    later affidavit of assets and means filed on 2 June 2011 (at para
                    91):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The [husband] was aware of the significant difference between the
                        school fees for [the international school] and local schools. Despite this,
                        and despite my own preference that the children should attend local schools,
                        the [husband] insisted on enrolling both children at [the international
                        school]. Since it was done at [husband’s] insistence, the [husband]
                        said he would pay the children’s international school fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my opinion, this new position was a deliberate attempt by the wife
                    to avoid her responsibility to bear part of the school fees for an international
                    school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The second reason was that in 2007 the wife
                    had already offered to pay half of the school fees. This offer had been made in
                    a letter dated 5 November 2007 sent by her previous solicitors Bih Li &amp;
                    Lee to the husband’s former solicitors Bajwa &amp; Co. Even then the wife
                    baulked at paying her half share, suggesting that she had no money to do so.
                    Consequently, Bih Li &amp; Lee wrote on 25 June 2009 to suggest that the
                    husband pay the school fees first. Then in a letter from the wife’s
                    present solicitors Allen &amp; Gledhill dated 16 June 2010, the wife made a
                    U-turn. She alleged that parties had agreed that the husband was to pay
                    (entirely) for the school fees as it was the husband’s wish for the
                    children to study at an international school. The alleged agreement by the
                    husband was untrue. It was also untrue that he had insisted that the children
                    study at an international school which is what the wife was suggesting through
                    Allen &amp; Gledhill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ms Loo also tried to persuade me that the
                    earlier offer of 5 November 2007 was limited to local school fees but I saw
                    no reason to see the offer as being so restricted. There was no such suggestion
                    in the correspondence and the wife had not alluded to that in her affidavits.
                    Neither did Ms Loo mention this point earlier when the husband’s previous
                    counsel first stressed the wife’s agreement on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Third, I looked at the earning capacity of the
                        parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The wife initially
                    said she earned an income of an average of $10,000 per month. The husband
                    initially said he earned about $13,750 per month. Both did not seem to have
                    taken into account the profits their clinics made. From various income tax
                    assessments, their earning capacities did not seem to be very different. Indeed,
                    the fact that the wife had offered to pay half of the school fees suggested that
                    she herself had acknowledged that their earning capacities were about equal.
                    However as the husband was the one who bore most, if not all, the expenses in
                    the past, I concluded that it would be fair to order the husband and wife to
                    bear the school fees in the ratio 60:40 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The husband also asked for an order that the
                    wife reimburse him 40% of the school fees from 1 January 2009. I allowed
                    the husband’s request and made the order. Ms Loo then objected on the
                    basis that the earning capacity of the wife in 2009 had been far lower than the
                    husband’s. I rejected this argument for the same reasons set out above (at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>). I also ordered the wife to reimburse
                    the husband 40% of the daughter’s accommodation and living expenses while
                    she was studying in England. The husband was to provide the wife with reasonable
                    documentary evidence of the daughter’s school fees, accommodation and
                    living expenses overseas to claim reimbursement from the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I also ordered that any sum to be paid by the
                    wife to the husband as reimbursement may be set-off against her share of the
                    sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The last issue I had to decide was the amount
                    that the husband should contribute towards the children’s living expenses
                    while they were staying in Singapore with the wife. According to the wife, the
                    personal monthly expenses for the daughter and son were $755 and $635
                        respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The wife also
                    asked for the husband’s contribution towards the children’s share of
                    certain household expenses, for example the $4,300 monthly rent of her
                    apartment, the $1,300 monthly loan repayment for her car, and $285 for
                    ERP/carpark fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> I set out in
                    Annexes B and C the wife’s claim for the children’s monthly personal
                    expenses and for household expenses for all three of them. It seemed to me that
                    the wife would have incurred many of the household expenses whether or not she
                    had care and control of the children. For example, it was not her evidence that
                    she would move to a smaller apartment if she did not have to take care of the
                    children. My conclusion was reinforced by the fact that at present the daughter
                    spends a large part of the year in England. For these reasons and using a broad
                    brush approach, I found the reasonable personal expenses for each child to be
                    $700 per month (which is close to what the wife was claiming) and an additional
                    $300 per month for each child for his/her share of household expenses (including
                    maid expense), making a total of $2,000 a month. The husband was to pay 60%,
                        <em>ie</em>, $1,200 per month from 1 January
                    2010.</p>
