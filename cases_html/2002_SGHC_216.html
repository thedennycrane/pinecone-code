</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The appellant was convicted

in the district court on one count of outrage of modesty pursuant to s 354 of the Penal

Code (Cap 224) and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the

cane. Initially, the appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence.

Subsequently, at the hearing on 3 September, the appellant dropped his appeal on

conviction and proceeded with his appeal on sentence only. I allowed his appeal in part. I

allowed the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment to remain but set aside the three

strokes of the cane. I now give my reasons. </p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">The facts</p>
<p></p></i></b>2        The appellant was charged as

follows: 

<ol start="2" xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">You, </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Name: Wong Soon Lee, M/44 years</p>
<p align="justify">NRIC No: S 1252347E</p>
<p align="justify">Nationality: Singaporean</p>
<p align="justify">DOB: 13.03.1957</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">are charged that you, on the 26<sup>th</sup> day of July 2001, sometime

  after 9pm, inside the premises of "Take Off" pub located at Paramount Shopping

  Centre along Katong Road, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Nah Sze Ling, F/24

  years old, to wit, by touching her breast with your left hand, knowing it to be likely

  that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said Nah Sze Lin, and you have thereby

  committed an offence punishable under Section 354 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</font>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">3        On 26 July 2001, at around 8 p.m., the

complainant Nah Sze Ling Tricia ("Tricia") went to the Take-Off Pub ("the

pub") at Paramount Shopping Centre with her friend Doreen Leong Siew Peng

("Doreen"). Both of them were flight stewardesses at the time of the incident.

The pub belonged to Kelly, a colleague of the two flight stewardesses. </p>
<p xmlns="">4        When Tricia and Doreen arrived, they went

to sit at the bar counter. The appellant was already there. They did not notice him at

first, but, after a while, they realised that he was staring at them. He tried to get

their attention by mumbling something to them. Doreen and Tricia ignored him. He then

shouted at them, saying that if they were not happy, they need not sit there. Doreen and

Tricia noticed that he was drunk and slurring in his speech. </p>
<p xmlns="">5        Tricia and Doreen then complained to Kelley

about the appellant’s behaviour. Kelley told the appellant that Doreen was his wife

and asked him to leave them alone. This was in fact not true, but it seemed to work as the

appellant stopped trying to harass them. After a while, however, the appellant started

staring at them again. </p>
<p xmlns="">6        After that, three more of Tricia’s

colleagues arrived: Ng May Na ("May Na"), Ang Teck Cheng ("TC") and

Penny Yong Pin Fong ("Penny"). They joined Tricia and Doreen at the bar counter.

Upon arrival, Tricia and Doreen told them about how the appellant had been staring at

them. TC went up to the appellant and told him to relax, have a drink and not disturb the

girls. TC heard the appellant reply something along the lines of, "she’s the

boss’ wife, it’s okay, never mind, it’s okay". TC then placed himself

between the appellant and Tricia. Subsequently, the appellant reached out across TC and

touched Tricia’s left breast. Tricia exclaimed and slapped the appellant before

running out of the pub. TC, Penny and May Na witnessed the appellant touching

Tricia’s left breast. </p>
<p xmlns="">7        Tricia and her friends subsequently called

the police. At about 9.47 p.m., Sgt James Siew ("Sgt Siew") arrived at the

scene. He saw Tricia and Doreen crying and looking upset. Sgt Siew then interviewed the

appellant and observed that he smelt of alcohol. The appellant was sent to Changi General

Hospital for a medical examination and was examined by one Dr. Goh Ting Hui ("Dr.

Goh"). Dr. Goh noted that he smelt of alcohol. A blood sample was collected from the

appellant at 2.10 a.m. A blood test conducted on the sample revealed that there was 191 mg

ethanol per 100 ml of blood. </p>
<p xmlns="">8        The respondent’s case below was that

the appellant had intentionally touched the left breast of the complainant with his left

hand knowing it to be likely that he would thereby outrage her modesty. The

appellant’s case below was that he had drunk a lot of alcohol that evening. Prior to

drinking at the pub, he had been to one Barrel Pub in Siglap at about 4 p.m. where he

drank about three to four glasses of beer and whiskey. After that, he proceeded to the pub

where he continued drinking whiskey. He claimed that, when he woke up at the police

lock-up, he had no recollection of what had taken place in the pub.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">9        The trial judge found that the prosecution

had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the accused on the charge. In

sentencing the appellant, the trial judge noted that the benchmark sentence for outrage of

modesty cases where the victim’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded is a

nine month jail term and caning: see <i>Chandresh Patel v PP </i>[1995] 1 CLAS 323. She

also noted that the appellant had previous brushes with the law arising from excessive

alcohol consumption. In August 1986 he was fined and disqualified from driving for one

year for drink driving. Again, in July 1989, he was fined and disqualified for driving for

two years for failing to provide a blood/urine specimen for testing under s 69 of the Road

Traffic Act. The trial judge also found that the appellant had voluntarily induced his

state of drunkenness and he had done so in a public place. Therefore, it was quite

foreseeable that he could have caused trouble to himself and the people around him. In

light of these factors, the trial judge was of the view that a sentence above the

benchmark should be imposed and ordered the appellant to be sentenced to 12 months’

imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Appeal against sentence</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">10        In his present appeal against sentence and

in mitigation in the court below, the appellant submitted that he was divorced and had

custody of a 15 year-old son suffering from a rare blood disease. His son requires regular

blood transfusions and is taking his GCE ‘O’ Levels examinations this year. He

submitted that a custodial sentence would cause hardship to his son. </p>
<p xmlns="">11        The short answer to that was that the

appellant had only brought it upon himself. The legal position on this issue was clear:

while the Court may be sympathetic to the families of accused persons, hardship caused to

the family occasioned by imprisonment is of little weight today: <i>Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7469&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 305</a>, <i>Lim Choon Kang v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7812&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 927</a> and <i>PP v Tan Fook Sum</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48341&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 2 SLR 523</a>. In this context, it is perhaps timely to reiterate a passage from

Widgery CJ’s judgment in <i>R v Ingham</i> (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 184 (which was

referred to in <i>Lai Oei Mui Jenny</i> and <i>Tan Fook Sum</i>): 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">… it is not altogether an easy case, but of course,

    this always happens, time and time again, that imprisonment of the father inevitably

    causes hardship to the rest of the family. If we were to listen to this kind of argument

    regularly and normally in the cases that come before us, we should be considering not the

    necessary punishment for the offender but the extent to which his wife and family might be

    prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay when committing

    a crime is that imprisonment does involve hardship on the wife and family, and it cannot

    be one of the factors which can affect what would otherwise be the right sentence. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In <i>Tan Fook Sum</i>, I stated at 539 that "[a]lthough ensuing

hardship may exceptionally mitigate the rigour of punishment, the circumstances must be

exceptional before the court will decide against a custodial sentence on this

ground." On the facts of the present case, the appellant had not managed to satisfy

me that it was an exceptional case worthy of a reduction on the grounds of hardship to his

son. </p>
<p xmlns="">12        The DPP submitted that the sentence was

not manifestly excessive in light of the appellant’s choice to claim trial and going

through three full days of trial in the court below. I was of the opinion that this factor

was neither here nor there. Essentially, the appellant’s defence below was one of

bare denial and non-recollection of events. In <i>Teo Keng Pong v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10374&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 3 SLR 329</a>,

I stated at p 341 that it would be very dangerous to discount the accused’s evidence

merely because it was a ‘bare denial’. Even though the appellant in <i>Teo Keng

Pong</i> went through a full trial and relied on a defence of bare denial, I nevertheless

proceeded to find that some of the sentences were manifestly excessive and varied them

accordingly. Similarly, on the particular facts of the present case, I saw no reason to

adversely affect the appellant’s sentence simply because he had claimed trial. </p>
<p xmlns="">13        Next, I turned to the question of whether

the trial judge was correct in enhancing the sentence from the benchmark of nine

months’ imprisonment to 12 months’ imprisonment. Although the antecedents were

not strictly of a similar nature to an offence under s 354, the trial judge was correct to

take them into account because they shared some broad similarities arising from the

appellant’s habit of drink: see <i>R Yoganathan v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49459&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 264</a>, <i>Leong

Mun Kwai v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10081&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 2 SLR 338</a> and <i>Lim Kim Seng &amp; Anor v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6025&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 743</a>. DA Thomas in <i>Principles of Sentencing </i>at pp 178-9 summarised the position in

England to be as follows: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The cases suggest that the appellant may be treated as a

    first offender where the subsequent offence can be seen as an isolated act out of

    character, rather than an extension of the offender’s criminal activity into a

    hitherto unexplored field … <i>To be considered an offence out of character, the

    later offence should fall into a quite different broad category from the previous offences</i>…

    (emphasis added).</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I found no reason for the local position to be any different from that

in England. I was of the opinion that the appellant’s previous incidents of drunk

driving were not incidents out of character. Therefore, I found that the sentence of 12

months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive in light of the appellant’s

previous brushes with the law arising from his excessive alcohol consumption. </p>
<p xmlns="">14        However, I was of the opinion that the

imposition of three strokes of the cane was manifestly excessive in light of the

circumstances of the case. I was mindful of my earlier decision in <i>Chandresh Patel</i>

where I laid down the benchmark of nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the

cane where a female’s private parts or sexual organs are intruded. However, as I

stated in <i>Ng Chiew Kiat v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50029&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 370</a> at 383: 

</p><ol start="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The offence of outrage of modesty under s 354 of the

    Penal Code encompasses a wide range of criminal behaviour. <i>The appropriate sentence for

    each case would largely depend on the nature of the act of molest as well as the

    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence in question</i>. (emphasis added)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">15        In <i>Nordin bin Ismail v PP </i>[1996] 1 CLAS News 250, the appellant was a police corporal who molested a woman police constable

at the police station. Two of the charges were that he placed his hand on her shoulder and

on her waist respectively. He was originally sentenced to three and four months’

imprisonment for each of the two offences. On appeal, I reduced the sentence to a $500

fine for each of the two offences.</p>
<p xmlns="">16        In <i>Soh Yang Tick</i> <i>v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45534&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 42</a>, the appellant was faced with two charges of outraging the modesty of a secretary

in his office. There, the appellant had allegedly touched the complainant’s back and

abdomen by putting his hand inside the jacket that the complainant was wearing and, on

another occasion, he used his hand to lightly slap the complainant’s buttock. He was

convicted on both charges and appealed. I allowed the appeal against conviction on the

first charge but dismissed the appeal against conviction on the second charge. However, I

allowed the appeal against sentence on the second charge and reduced the sentence from one

of imprisonment to a fine of $2,000. </p>
<p xmlns="">17        In <i>Teo Keng Pong</i>, the appellant was

convicted on not one, but six charges of outraging the modesty of a 13 year-old girl to

whom he was giving tuition lessons. The charges related to the appellant caressing the

girl’s thigh, back and touching her left breast over a period of three weeks. I

sentenced the accused to a total of seven months’ imprisonment and fines of $2,500. I

did not find that the circumstances of the case warranted an imposition of any strokes of

the cane. </p>
<p xmlns="">18        On the present facts, the trial judge

accepted the complainant’s testimony that the appellant touched her left breast for

about two to three seconds. According to the testimony of various prosecution witnesses at

the trial, the appellant was in a state of ‘high’ at the time of the incident.

Subsequently, it was determined that there was 191 mg of ethanol in his blood some five

hours after the incident. </p>
<p xmlns="">19        I was satisfied that the facts and

circumstances surrounding the present case were sufficiently close to the case of <i>Teo

Keng Pong</i> on the wide spectrum of s 354 offences to warrant a setting aside of the

three strokes of the cane. I was of the view that <i>Nordin bin Ismail</i>, <i>Soh Yang

Tick</i> and <i>Teo Keng Pong</i>, together with the present case, fall on the side of the

spectrum where an imposition of strokes of the cane would have been manifestly excessive.

In my opinion, a custodial sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment would be sufficiently

just punishment for the appellant to reflect on his habit of excessive drink and to learn

his lesson that not all people will approve of unwanted physical contact. Accordingly, I

allowed the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment to remain, but set aside the three

strokes of the cane.</p>
