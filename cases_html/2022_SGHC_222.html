In such a case, it would be correct for the COE rebate to be issued to the registered owner. Kenso submitted that this was the basis under which the legislation had originally been drafted. However, the drafters did not envisage the situation where the rights of the legal and beneficial owners diverged from those of the registered owners. Kenso argued that applying the literal interpretation advocated by the LTA would result in a registered owner, like a hirer, being entitled to a windfall where he has defaulted in the payment of monthly instalments. Furthermore, hirers might even be enticed to deliberately not pay road tax and force the deregistration of the vehicle, and then claim the PARF and COE rebates without repayment of the financed amounts to any hire purchase companies, which can be a very substantial sum in the case of new vehicles.

Parties were unable to highlight any statutory provision that provides the LTA with the discretion to cancel the COE in circumstances where the vehicle registration was cancelled pursuant to s 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA, for failure to pay road tax. The LTA’s position at the appeal, after counsel for the LTA stood down to take instructions from the LTA in the course of the hearing, was that the cancellation of the COE took place when Kenso disposed of the Vehicle on 21 September 2021 and that the provision of COE rebate would be pursuant to r 21B of the MVQS Rules. Counsel for Kenso informed the court that Kenso did not dispute that it disposed of the Vehicle on 21 September 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The absence of a reference to s 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA from r 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MVQS Rules did not assist Kenso, since by this submission, the LTA would have had no statutory basis in the first place to cancel the COE. There is no COE rebate if the COE is not cancelled. That being the case, the Question, that is, the issue of whether the LTA can give the COE rebate to the legal and beneficial owner instead of the registered owner, would not even arise. In the alternative raised by the LTA at the hearing of the appeal, that the COE rebate is made pursuant to r 21B of the MVQS Rules, that provision expressly provides that the holder of the COE, that is the registered owner, is the party to apply for the COE rebate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, Kenso’s reliance on<span class="font-italic"> Cycle </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Carriage</span> was misplaced. That case arose in a different context and involved the determination of property rights over the PARF certificate as between the legal and beneficial owner and the registered owner. <span class="font-italic">Cycle </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Carriage</span> did not deal with COE rebate nor did it make a finding on whom the LTA is entitled to give the COE rebate to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 There was, for example, no consideration in <span class="font-italic">Cycle </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Carriage </span>that the regime for COE rebate is governed by statute. Section 10A of the RTA, in subsections (1), (2) and (4)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>), refers to the registration of vehicles on the basis of permits and states that the Minister may make rules to provide for the cancellation of the permit and the refund of all or part of the levy paid for the permit as may be permitted by the rules. Rule 2(1) of the MVQS Rules states that the COE is a permit issued under s 10A(1) of the RTA. The statutory provisions in the MVQS Rules, which allow the LTA to give COE rebates upon cancellation of the COE, refer only to the holder of the COE, that is, the registered owner. This can be seen from rr 20(2), 20(3), 20(5), 21(1), 21A(1) and 21B(1) of the MVQS Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Neither did <span class="font-italic">Cycle </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Carriage</span> consider the issue of whether the LTA could transfer the COE rebate to a person other than the registered owner or his nominee under r 20(5) of the MVQS Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Hence, <span class="font-italic">Cycle </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Carriage</span> does not stand as authority for the proposition advocated by Kenso, that the LTA is empowered to transfer the COE rebate to the legal and beneficial owner of a vehicle, without the consent of the registered owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Third, Kenso submitted that a purposive interpretation (as opposed to a literal interpretation) of the legislation would support its position, but it has not shown that there are two or more interpretations of the relevant statutory provisions. In his dissenting opinion in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">ttorney-General v Ting Choon Meng</span> <span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Choon Meng</span>”), Menon CJ observed at [57] that the purposive approach arises “where the court discerns that there are two or more interpretations of a statutory provision, but only one of which would promote the purpose or object of the statute”. This was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [36]–[37]. Kenso submitted that there is ambiguity in that it is not clear that the LTA had the power to cancel the COE under r 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MVQS Rules. However, that goes towards the issue of whether the LTA had the power to cancel the COE rebate in the first place, and not the subsequent question of whether, after having cancelled the COE rebate, the LTA could give the COE rebate to the legal and beneficial owner of a vehicle without the consent of the registered owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Neither had Kenso identified any parliamentary speech that suggests that the purpose of the relevant provisions is to allow for the legal and beneficial owner to receive the COE rebate, rather than the registered owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Moreover, the purposive interpretation sought by Kenso would completely go against the express wording of the relevant statutory provisions. The SGCA in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> had held at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It also bears mentioning that extraneous material cannot be used ‘to give the statute a sense which is contrary to its express text’ (<span class="font-italic">Seow Wei Sin v PP</span> [2011] 1 SLR 1199 at [21]) save perhaps in the very limited circumstances identified in s 9A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the IA (see [47(c)] above). This echoes the broader principle that the proper function of the judge when applying s 9A of the IA is to interpret a given statutory provision. Although purposive interpretation is an important and powerful tool, it is not an excuse for rewriting a statute (see [43] above). The authority to alter the text of a statute lies with Parliament, and judicial interpretation is generally confined to giving the text a meaning that its language can bear. Hence, purposive interpretation must be done with a view toward determining a provision’s or statute’s purpose and object ‘as reflected by and in harmony with the express wording of the legislation’: <span class="font-italic">PP v Low Kok Heng</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [50].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Kenso submitted that the literal interpretation of the legislation advocated by the LTA could result in a windfall to a registered owner like the hirer, or a windfall to the LTA if no party claims the COE rebate. However, such scenarios are predicated on a finance company taking no steps, with respect to the registered owner or the LTA, to claim the COE rebate. The LTA had highlighted that finance companies do have recourse. They could approach the registered owner to effect a transfer of the COE rebate, restore the registration status of a vehicle (prior to its disposal) and effect a transfer of the vehicle’s registered ownership to obtain the COE rebate, or sue the registered owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Kenso submitted that these steps suggested by the LTA were unrealistic. From the concerns highlighted by Kenso,

</div>
</div> it was clear that the nub of its concerns was not that such steps could not be undertaken, but that they involved some degree of financial costs to Kenso. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Kenso’s submission was that effecting a transfer of the vehicle’s registered ownership to obtain the COE rebate in this case would result in the “loss of the COE rebate for over 2 years”. The alternative of suing the hirer would “only unnecessarily incur more costs in having to advertise the originating summons in the newspapers for service of the originating summons to be deemed served on him”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 That Kenso would have to bear some financial cost in obtaining the COE rebate is, however, not a legal basis for reading the MVQS Rules, MVRL Rules and RTA differently from what they clearly state, which is that only the registered owner or his nominee, is entitled to the benefit of a COE rebate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In conclusion, I answered the Question in the negative. Kenso had not shown any statutory basis for the LTA to give a COE rebate where the vehicle registration was cancelled pursuant to s 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA. Moreover, all the statutory provisions where the LTA is allowed to make COE rebates only allow the LTA to make the COE rebate to the registered owner or the nominee, and not to the legal and beneficial owner. There was hence no legal basis for the LTA to be directed to transfer the COE rebate to Kenso, the legal and beneficial owner of the Vehicle, without the consent of the registered owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the above reasons, I allowed the appeal. Taking into consideration the costs of $1,000 that had been paid by the LTA to Kenso in the court below for the leave to appeal application, I ordered costs to be paid by Kenso to the LTA for this appeal (including OS189/2022), in the sum of $8,000 all in.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vishi Sundar, Tan Wenjing Lesley &amp; Ye Zhichun (WongPartnership LLP) for the Appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vijai Dharamdas Parwani &amp; Huang Po Han (Parwani Law LLC) for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
