<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action was brought to enforce a foreign
                    judgment. On 9 July 2009, the plaintiff, Bellezza Club Japan Co Ltd,
                    successfully obtained summary judgment on its claim to enforce the judgment the
                    plaintiff had obtained in the Tokyo District Court on 11 July 2006 against
                    the first defendant, Akihiko Matsumura (“D1”), which said judgment
                    was upheld on appeal to the Tokyo High Court on 26 December 2007, and on
                    further appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan on 18 July 2008. On
                    6 October 2009, D1’s appeal against the 9 July 2009 order of the
                    Assistant Registrar, Ms Ang Ching Pin (“AR Ang”), was
                    dismissed. D1 has since appealed against my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a company registered in Japan.
                    At all material times, the plaintiff’s shares were equally held by two
                    companies, Tosho Corporation KK (“Tosho”) and Brother Sales Ltd
                    (“Brother Sales”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Between 12 February 1991 and 15 August
                    1994, the plaintiff extended three loans to Tosho and another two loans to a
                    company affiliated to Tosho and KK Micro Device. During this period, D1 was
                    a representative director and president of both the plaintiff and Tosho. The
                    second and third defendants are the brothers of D1 and they held the post of
                    director of Tosho at different times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff started an action in the Tokyo
                    District Court against the defendants and 3 others as guarantors of the
                    abovementioned loans (“the first Tokyo litigation”). The Tokyo
                    District Court allowed the claims and gave judgment for the plaintiff on
                    11 July 2006, holding that D1 was jointly and severally liable with 3
                    others for a total sum of ¥1,217,139,001 with interest (“the Tokyo
                    judgment”). It is common ground that the Tokyo judgment was handed down
                    after a full trial on its merits. D1’s appeal to the Tokyo High Court was
                    dismissed on 26 December 2007. His further appeal from the Tokyo High Court
                    to the Supreme Court of Japan was also dismissed on 18 July 2008. It is not
                    disputed that there are no further avenues of appeal in Japan against the Tokyo
                    judgment. The debate here focussed on the question of a re-trial as distinct
                    from the notion of an appeal. A further point to note is that the plaintiff has
                    recovered part of the judgment sum and interest. This action was brought to
                    enforce the Tokyo judgment for the outstanding judgment sum and interest. The
                    application for summary judgment was filed only against D1 and not the other
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before the plaintiff brought this action in
                    Singapore, two other actions were commenced in Japan. One of the actions was
                    started by D1 in the Nagoya District Court on 3 August 2007 against
                    the plaintiff and Brother Industries Ltd, the parent company of Brother Sales
                    (the “Nagoya litigation”). The other action was commenced by the
                    plaintiff in the Tokyo District Court on 7 November 2007 against D1 and
                    others (the “second Tokyo litigation”). Both suits were pending in
                    Japan when this appeal, (“RA 264/2009”), was listed for hearing
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">D1’s opposition to summary judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       D1 resisted the application for summary judgment
                    on several grounds. Counsel for D1, Mr Nanda Kumar
                    (“Mr Kumar”), initially raised two arguments before
                    AR Ang. First, the Tokyo judgment should not be enforced as it was not
                    final and conclusive. Second, it was against the public policy of Singapore to
                    enforce the Tokyo judgment which was in respect of transactions that may
                    subsequently be found to be in violation of the laws of Japan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After AR Ang entered judgment for the plaintiff,
                    an affidavit was filed on 3 August 2009 on behalf of D1, claiming that one
                    of the other guarantors who was held to be jointly and severally liable under
                    the Tokyo judgment, namely KK Sogo Biyou Ikagaku Kenkyujo
                    (“SBIK”), has an alleged monetary claim against the plaintiff, and
                    that SBIK has therefore a right to set-off its monetary claim against
                    SBIK’s joint and several liabilities as guarantor to the plaintiff under
                    the Tokyo judgment. The argument was that this right to set-off claimed by SBIK
                    should be used to reduce the judgment sum in the event the plaintiff’s
                    entitlement to summary judgment stands. Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Alma
                    Yong (“Ms Yong”), objected to the late affidavit but she
                    explained that she had nevertheless filed the plaintiff’s affidavit in
                    reply on 20 August 2009 so as not to delay the hearing. Given the state of
                    affairs, I granted leave for both affidavits to be filed and relied upon for the
                    hearing of RA 264/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Kumar raised another new argument in his
                    written submissions. This argument was not pleaded in the Defence or raised in
                    any of the affidavits filed on behalf of D1. It was claimed in the written
                    submissions that D1 had a <em>bona fide</em> counterclaim
                    in the Nagoya litigation against the plaintiff which constitutes an equitable
                    set-off. By way of explanation, the Nagoya litigation arose out of a number of
                    loans made by Brother Sales to the plaintiff, for which D1 had acted as
                    guarantor. D1 claimed that, as guarantor, he has the right under Japanese law to
                    obtain in advance reimbursement from the plaintiff, who is the principal debtor
                    of those loans, even before the principal creditor calls on the loan. The
                    equitable set-off was allegedly based on D1’s claim for advance
                    reimbursement in the Nagoya litigation. Mr Kumar argued that D1’s
                    counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation against the plaintiff was closely
                    connected with the guarantees upon which the Tokyo judgment was founded so that
                    it would be unjust for the plaintiff to enforce the Tokyo judgment without
                    taking into account D1’s counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation against the
                    plaintiff. D1’s counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation apparently far
                    exceeded the plaintiff’s claim in the present action against
                        D1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For the reasons given below, none of the grounds
                    raised a triable issue. Suffice it to say at this point that D1’s
                    arguments were built entirely on suppositions rather than from credible facts in
                    evidence. I also noted that the plaintiff had already enforced the Tokyo
                    judgment in Japan, and had obtained partial satisfaction of the judgment sum and
                    interest in 2006. The present action was commenced in Singapore for the
                    outstanding judgment sum and interest on 20 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Enforcement of foreign judgments: the law in general</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The law on the enforcement of a foreign
                    judgment as a debt at common law is well-settled. Foreign judgments <em>in personam</em> may be enforced by a claim in proceedings in
                    Singapore if the foreign judgment is a money judgment of a court of competent
                    jurisdiction, and that the judgment pronounced by the foreign court is final and
                    conclusive as between the parties. Moreover, the Singapore court will not
                    ordinarily reopen the merits of the claim on which the foreign judgment is based
                    or challenge the factual findings made by the foreign court. The general rule
                    was restated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Hong Pian Tee v Les
                        Placements Germain Gauthier Inc</em>
                    [2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“<em>Les
                        Placements</em>”) (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Quite apart from the arrangements under the RECJA or the REFJA, it is
                        settled law that a foreign judgment <em>in
                            personam</em> given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction
                        may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as the
                        foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. The
                        foreign judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and
                        cannot be impeached for any error, whether of fact or of law: <em>Godard v Gray</em> (1870) LR 6 QB 139. In
                        respect of such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made
                        on the ground that the defendant has no defence to the claim: <em>Grant v Easton</em> (1883) 13 QBD 302.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     There are three exceptions to the general rule
                    on enforcement of a foreign judgment at common law. As the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Les Placements</em> said (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The local court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign
                        judgment if it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its
                        enforcement would be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in
                        which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice: see
                            <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em> Vol 8(1)
                        (Butterworths, 4th Ed) (1996 Reissue) paras 1008-1010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Where an allegation of fraud has already been
                    raised, argued, and adjudicated upon by a foreign court (as was the case in the
                    Tokyo judgment), the position in Singapore following the approach taken by
                    Canadian and Australian cases is that the foreign judgment may be challenged
                    here in Singapore on the ground of fraud only if fresh evidence has come to
                    light, and only when the fresh evidence could not have been uncovered with
                    reasonable diligence at the time of the trial (see <em>Les
                        Placements</em> at [30]). In addition, the fresh evidence must be
                    of a quality to make a difference to the outcome. D1’s allegation in
                    paras 9-24 of the Defence that the plaintiff’s claims were tainted by
                    fraud, deceit and/or mistake were already raised, argued and decided against D1
                    in the first Tokyo litigation, and on appeal by the Tokyo High Court. D1’s
                    second argument that the plaintiff’s claims were against public order,
                    morals, fairness and equitable principles was also, on appeal, rejected by the
                    Tokyo High Court. D1’s appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan, the final
                    court of appeal, was dismissed on 18 July 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In resisting the application for summary
                    judgment, D1 was in effect seeking to challenge the factual findings made in the
                    Tokyo judgment or to reopen the merits of the claims by his argument that
                        <em>if</em> D1 succeeds in the Nagoya litigation and
                    the second Tokyo litigation, the findings in the two suits might provide grounds
                    for a re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation and, hopefully, a revocation of the
                    Tokyo judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I will now deal with D1’s grounds of
                    opposition advanced by Mr Kumar as triable issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: The Tokyo judgment was not final</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The test of finality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Mr Kumar argued that the Tokyo judgment
                    was not final and conclusive because it <em>may</em> be
                    subject to a re-trial under Article 338(1) sub-paras (vi) or (vii) of the Code
                    of Civil Procedure (Act No 109 of June 26, 1996) (“CCP”)
                    (see <a href="#p1_18">[19]</a> below). Before I deal with the
                    question of a re-trial under the CCP, a good starting point is to examine the
                    test of finality. A summary of this test can be found in Dicey, Morris and
                    Collins, <em>The Conflict of Laws</em> (Sir Lawrence
                    Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at Vol 1,
                    para 14-021:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test of finality is the treatment of the judgment by the foreign
                        tribunal as <em>res judicata</em>. “In order to
                        establish that [a final and conclusive] judgment has been pronounced, it
                        must be shown that in the court by which it was pronounced, it conclusively,
                        finally, and forever established the existence of the debt of which it is
                        sought to be made conclusive evidence in this country, so as to make it
                            <em>res judicata</em> between the parties.”
                        A foreign judgment which is liable to be abrogated or varied by the court
                        which pronounced it is not a final judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The test makes it necessary to refer to the
                    foreign law in assessing the finality of the foreign judgment because it would,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… verge on absurdity that we should regard as conclusive something
                        in a [foreign] judgment which the [foreign] courts themselves would not
                        regard as conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Furthermore, the test of finality only
                    requires that the judgment be final and conclusive in the particular court in
                    which it was pronounced. The fact that the judgment may be altered or varied on
                    appeal would not render it any less final or conclusive; this much was made
                    clear in the decision of <em>Nouvion v Freeman</em> (1889)
                    15 App Cas 1 (“<em>Nouvion</em>”)

                        pronounced it; and if appealable the English Court will only enforce it,
                        subject to conditions which will save the interests of those who have the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable Japanese law on the question of finality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Tsutomu Kuribayashi, a partner in
                    M/s Kuribayashi Sogo Law Office, who represented the plaintiff in the first
                    Tokyo litigation, confirmed in his affidavit filed on 20 May 2009 that
                    Article 338 of the CCP refers to an application for a re-trial; it does not
                    allow D1 to file an appeal and there is no further avenue for an appeal against
                    the Tokyo judgment. Mr Kuribayashi also confirmed that an appeal to the
                    Supreme Court of Japan is the final appeal, and that the decision of the Supreme
                    Court of Japan of 18 July 2008 is final and binding regardless of the
                    outcome of the Nagoya litigation and second Tokyo litigation. The point being
                    made is that a re-trial is distinct from an appeal to a higher court. D1’s
                    position is not really different as the affidavits filed on D1’s behalf
                    referred only to a re-trial under Article 338.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Mr Kumar relying on the <em>Nouvion</em> submitted that the test of finality is simply to
                    determine whether the foreign judgment <em>may</em> be
                    abrogated, varied or altered by the same court which made it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. According to his notion of the test, the
                    Tokyo judgment cannot be final and conclusive as it may be subject to a re-trial
                    by the Tokyo High Court and a subsequent order that the Tokyo judgment be
                    revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is now a convenient juncture to refer to
                    the English version of Article 338 which reads as follows:</p>

                            provided, however, that this shall not apply where a party, when filing
                            the appeal to the court of second instance or final appeal, alleged such
                            grounds or did not allege them while being aware of them:</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   The judgment was made in the absence of the
                                authority of statutory representation, authority of representation
                                in a suit or the delegation of powers necessary for performing

                                which the judgment pertaining to the appeal was made, has been
                                modified by a subsequent judicial decision or administrative

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(x)    The judgment pertaining to an appeal conflicts
                                with a previous judgment that has become final and

                            be filed only if, with regard to a punishable act, a judgment of
                            conviction or judgment of a non-penal fine has become final and binding,

                    that he succeeds in obtaining judgment in either of the actions in the Nagoya
                    litigation or the second Tokyo litigation, there <em>may</em> be grounds for a re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation.
                    Elaborating, D1 said that <em>if</em> there was a finding
                    that the evidence given in the first Tokyo litigation was false or forged, he
                    would then be able to rely on such a finding to file for a re-trial of the first
                    Tokyo litigation pursuant to sub-paras (1)(vi) and/or (1)(vii) of Article
                        338.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Turning to D1’s expert, Professor
                    Hiroyuki Hirano from Keio Law School of Japan (“Professor Hirano”)
                    agreed in his affidavit that an action for a re-trial may be filed after final
                    judgment has been issued in Japan, but his opinion was merely a theoretical one,
                    and rightly so, given the assumptions he had to make. In his opinion, D1 would
                    be able to file an action for re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation pursuant to
                    Article 338 only <em>if</em> D1 prevails in the Nagoya
                    litigation or the second Tokyo litigation <em>and</em> only
                        <em>if</em> there are grounds for a re-trial under
                    Article 338.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In Professor’s Hirano’s own
                    words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the only option open to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant now is to wait for the judgment in either the Nagoya litigation or
                        the 2<sup>nd</sup> Tokyo Litigation…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At the time the present action was commenced
                    in Singapore to enforce the Tokyo judgment, the “option” for a
                    re-trial in Japan pursuant to Article 338 was <em>not</em>
                    available at all to D1. As Professor Hirano pointed out, the
                    “option” was contingent not only upon a successful outcome for D1
                    in one of the two pending actions in Japan, but also upon there being grounds
                    for D1 to rely on so that he could fulfil the conditions in Article 338. In
                    short, D1’s argument that the Tokyo judgment was inconclusive and not
                    final was premised on an option that <em>may</em> become
                    available in the future. The speculative basis underpinning the argument was not
                    lost on AR Ang, and I agreed with AR Ang that the argument was “premised
                    on uncertain outcomes of future events”. AR Ang correctly concluded
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there was no reason why this court should disregard the
                        incontrovertible fact that the judgment at hand was issued by a competent
                        court of foreign jurisdiction, affirmed by the highest appellate court in
                        Japan and the [first defendant] has not requested for a stay of
                        execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I agreed with Ms Yong that the Tokyo
                    judgment is final and conclusive. In the case of <em>Vanquelin v
                        Bouard</em> (1863) 15 CB (NS) 341; 143 ER 817 the
                    defendant there sought to resist, in the Court of Common Pleas, the enforcement
                    of a French default judgment that could be set aside as soon as the defendant
                    entered an appearance according to French law. Erle CJ made it clear that
                    until the defendant took steps to set it aside, the default judgment was final
                    and conclusive for the purpose of bringing an action in England
                    (at ER 828):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The twelfth plea, to the first count, alleges that the judgment in the
                        first count mentioned was a judgment by default for want of an appearance by
                        the defendant in the court of the Tribunal of Commerce, and by the law of
                        France would become void as of course on an appearance being entered. I
                        apprehend that every judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction
                        is valid, and may be the foundation of an action in our courts, though
                        subject to the contingency, that, <em>by adopting a certain
                            course, the party against whom the judgment is obtained might cause it
                            to be vacated or set aside. But, until that course has been pursued, the
                            judgment remains in full force and capable of being sued
                        upon</em>. The plaintiff, therefore, must have judgment on the
                        demurrer to this plea.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the more recent case of <em>Schnabel v Lui</em> [2002] NSWSC 15 (“<em>Schnabel</em>”) the Supreme Court of New South Wales
                    was faced with a question not unlike the one argued in RA 264/2009: whether a
                    US judgment was final and conclusive despite the existence of a rule in the
                    United States Code Annotated which allowed for relief from a final judgment to
                    be granted on specific grounds. After a detailed examination of the authorities,
                    Bergin J was satisfied that none of the authorities she reviewed stood for
                    the bare proposition that just because a judgment could be varied or altered by
                    the same court that made it, it must therefore follow that the judgment was
                    inconclusive and not final. Rather, Bergin J was of the opinion that the
                    party’s ability to apply to have a judgment set aside was immaterial. What
                    was crucial in Bergin J’s opinion was that the US judgment was
                        <em>res judicata</em> in the US courts as between the
                    parties <em>until it was set aside</em> (<em>Schnabel</em> at para [133]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Nouvion v Freeman</em> and <em>Vanquelin v Bouard</em> are authorities for the proposition that
                            <em>the test of finality is how the foreign jurisdiction
                            treats the judgment. The evidence in this case is overwhelming that the
                            foreign jurisdiction treats the judgment as a final judgment and that it
                            is res judicata the issues between the parties to the
                            litigation</em>. The effect that an application under Rule 60 (b)
                        may have on the finality of the US Judgment is expressly dealt with in the
                        Rule. It sates [sic]: "A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect
                        the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Furthermore, the decision of <em>Nouvion</em> cited by Mr Kumar is distinguishable given
                    the nature of the foreign judgment in question. The plaintiff there had sought
                    to enforce what was known as a remate judgment obtained in Spain through
                    executive or summary proceedings which only allowed a defendant to raise a
                    limited number of defences. Even after a remate judgment was granted, either
                    party would be at liberty to bring plenary or ordinary proceedings in order to
                    re-litigate the case on the merits and raise all legal defences. Crucially, the
                    remate judgment could not be relied upon as a defence in the plenary proceedings
                    and the House of Lords went on to hold that the remate judgment was not final.
                    Lord Herschell concluded that (<em>Nouvion</em> at
                    11):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the plaintiff in such a suit, an executive suit, is not, by the
                        decision which is now under appeal, deprived of his rights. He may still sue
                        upon the original cause of action. Of course it may happen, as in this
                        particular case, that such a suit is barred by lapse of time, but that is an
                        accident. <em>The right of the plaintiff to sue on his
                            original cause of action is not at all interfered with by the judgment
                            which has been pronounced; and in such an action, if it were brought,
                            all questions upon which the rights of the parties depend, and by the
                            solution of which the obligation to pay must ultimately be determined,
                            would be open to consideration</em> and could be dealt with by the
                        Courts, and finally and conclusively settled. I do not, therefore, see that
                        there is any wrong or any hardship done by holding that a judgment which
                        does not conclusively and for ever as between the parties establish the
                        existence of a debt in that Court cannot be looked upon as sufficient
                        evidence of it in the Courts of this country.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Tokyo judgment was clearly different in
                    character from the remate judgment in <em>Nouvion</em>. In
                    contrast, in the present case, the affidavit evidence confirmed that if a party
                    in Japan were to apply for a re-trial under Article 338, he would have to first
                    rely on one of the specific grounds in Article 338(1) and not on his original

                    Tokyo judgment in Japan before the present action was commenced in Singapore. It
                    was certainly not D1’s case that the Tokyo judgment was unenforceable in
                    Japan, and it would be difficult to imagine on what basis D1 could resist
                    enforcement in Japan when, as already mentioned, his case was simply that the
                    option to apply for a re-trial might be available to him in the future. Until
                    that happened, the Tokyo judgment remained binding and enforceable in Japan as
                    between the parties. Being <em>res judicata</em> between
                    the parties, the Toyko judgment quite clearly passed the test of finality as
                    pronounced in the authorities already discussed. In any event, the evidence on
                    Japanese law on the nature of the Tokyo judgment was not disputed between the
                    parties and that was sufficient for me to arrive at a conclusion as to the
                    finality of the Tokyo judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: D1’s claim that enforcement of the Tokyo judgment was
                against the public policy of Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     D1 argued that the courts in the Nagoya
                    litigation and the second Tokyo litigation might find that the guarantees at
                    issue in those cases were against the public order, morals or fair and equitable
                    principles of law in Japan. Following that assumption, D1 advanced the argument
                    that any such finding <em>could raise the implication</em>
                    that the Tokyo judgment was also founded on guarantees that were similarly in
                    breach of public order or principles of law in Japan, and that to allow the
                    plaintiff to enforce the Tokyo judgment under such circumstances would be
                    against the public policy of Singapore. Again, these arguments were premised on
                    the pious hope that the Nagoya litigation and the second Tokyo litigation would
                    be concluded in D1’s favour and a chance of a re-trial of the first Tokyo
                    litigation if there were findings that satisfy the grounds in Article
                    338.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As Ms Yong rightly pointed out, there is
                    no <em>bona fide</em> issue that the Tokyo judgment would
                    be against public policy in this country and that it, therefore, could not be
                    enforced. The question of whether the guarantees in the first Tokyo litigation
                    were “against the public order, morals, or fair and equitable principles
                    of law in Japan” had already been raised, argued and decided in favour of
                    the plaintiff by the Tokyo High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: D1’s claim against the plaintiff in a separate action
                gave him an equitable set-off against the plaintiff’s action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At the hearing of RA 264/2009, Mr Kumar
                    argued that unconditional leave to defend should be granted because of
                    D1’s counterclaim against the plaintiff which constitutes an equitable
                        set-off.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I have alluded to this argument
                    in <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above. Mr Kumar explained that
                    the counterclaim was based on D1’s claim that, under Japanese law, a
                    guarantor of a loan has the right to obtain an advance reimbursement from the
                    principal debtor (<em>ie</em>. the plaintiff) even before
                    the creditor calls on the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In response, Ms Yong said that the
                    equitable set-off argument was not pleaded in the Defence or raised in the
                    affidavits. There was no affidavit evidence regarding this alleged right of
                    advance reimbursement under Japanese law. Apart from Ms Yong’s valid
                    objections, D1 was no doubt seeking to avail himself of a counterclaim that was
                    not brought in proceedings before me to argue set off in equity or otherwise.
                    This was a wrong-headed argument that essentially assumed that a counterclaim
                    pending in foreign proceedings could be introduced in such a manner in order to
                    obtain unconditional leave to defend. Any set-off (assuming it was arguable)
                    must be in respect of a counterclaim filed by D1 in the proceedings here. As
                    Ms Yong pointed out, D1’s pleadings did not aver to any set off by
                    way of counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings. D1 also did not adduce any
                    affidavit evidence of an arguable equitable set-off in the Singapore proceedings
                    that was connected with any of the three exceptions to the general rule on
                    enforcement of a foreign judgment at common law (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 4: D1’s claim that he was entitled to reduce the judgment
                sum based on a right to set-off between the plaintiff and SBIK</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Kumar’s fall back argument was
                    that any summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff ought to be reduced from
                    ¥833,793,333 (that being the outstanding judgment sum) to
                        ¥823,293,333<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, on the basis that one of the other
                    guarantors, SBIK, who was also found liable to the plaintiff under the Tokyo
                    judgment, has filed a “Notice of Set-off” against the plaintiff in
                        Japan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Ms Yong explained that SBIK’s claim
                    was already time-barred, but notwithstanding that legal impediment, SBIK had not
                    raised this alleged set-off in the Tokyo litigation. Be that as it may, any
                    set-off between SBIK and the plaintiff is wholly distinct and separate from the
                    plaintiff’s action to enforce the Tokyo judgment here in Singapore against
                    D1. To raise this set-off as a triable issue, D1 would have to show that it
                    could properly avail itself of SBIK’s set-off. Mr Kumar cited two
                    authorities, namely the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>United Overseas Limited v Peter Robinson Limited (trading as Top
                        Shop)</em> (CA Transcript 91/0297, March 26 1991, unreported) and
                        <em>Hawley &amp; Hazel Chemical Co (S) Pte Ltd v Szu Ming
                        Trading Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 13 in argument. Those
                    authorities do not assist D1 as they deal with an equitable set-off as between a
                    plaintiff and a defendant in the same summary proceedings. There is nothing in
                    those authorities that suggests that a defendant could raise a defence of
                    equitable set-off in summary proceedings based on a right to set-off between the
                    plaintiff and another non-party. In any case, as Mr Yong rightly pointed
                    out, in an action to enforce a foreign judgment, the exceptions to the general
                    rule are fraud, public policy reasons and breach of natural justice. Set-off as
                    such is not a recognised exception <em>per se</em>. This
                    same point is relevant and also applies in answer to issue 3
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the reasons stated, the plaintiff was
                    entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, RA 264/2009 was dismissed with costs
                    at $3,800 and reasonable disbursements.</p>
