<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">          The appellant,

Sahadevan s/o Gundan was jointly charged with his friend, Jayakumaran s/o Saminathan

Retinam ("Kumar"), for committing robbery with hurt, of $50 in the possession of

one Vellaikkannu Pandi ("Pandi"), under s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). They

were both convicted of the charge by a district judge and sentenced to six years

imprisonment each.  The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. On 10

September 2002, I heard his appeal and allowed it. I now give my reasons.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The prosecution’s case</p>
<p></p></i>2        It was the prosecution’s case that

on 7 January 2002, at about 10.30 pm, Pandi had been dropped off after work at Yishun MRT

station, upon which he decided to go and visit his friend, who lived in Sembawang. Pandi

was an illegal immigrant offender, who had been issued a special pass by the immigration

department. Along the way, he stopped by a ‘Cheers’ outlet, at Blk 291 Yishun

Ring Road, to buy a bottle of beer. Subsequently, he changed his mind about visiting his

friend and went back to Yishun MRT station to take a look at the ‘pasar malam’

that was going on there. At about 1 am, in the early hours of the morning of 8 January

2002, he stopped by the same ‘Cheers’ outlet to buy a second bottle of beer. On

his way into the store, he was called by the appellant and Kumar, who were sitting on the

compound wall, facing the front entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. He waved at

them and asked them to "hold on". After buying his beer, he came out and joined

them on the compound wall. They enquired after his nationality and he replied that he was

from India.

<p>3        At about 2.15 am, the appellant and Kumar

got up and went to the side entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. They then returned

and the appellant asked Pandi how much money he had with him. When Pandi replied that he

had no money, Kumar spoke to him in a very harsh tone "big brother is asking, why

don’t you hand over your money". About 10 minutes later, Kumar moved four to

five metres away from Pandi and the appellant, towards the shop next to the

‘Cheers’ outlet. The appellant then asked again whether Pandi had any money.

When Pandi gave a negative reply, the appellant slapped him on his cheek. Pandi asked the

appellant why he had slapped him and the appellant slapped him again. Being fearful, Pandi

opened his wallet for the appellant to see. The appellant then took a $50 note and what

later turned to be a copy of the special pass belonging to Pandi and moved off to join

Kumar. </p>
<p>4        Pandi went to call the police, using the

public phone located at the side entrance of the ‘Cheers’ outlet. When he

returned to where the appellant and Kumar were previously, he found only the appellant

there. He approached the appellant and pleaded with him at least, to return the special

pass to him. At this point in time, the appellant used a lighter and burnt the copy of the

special pass before throwing its remains over the compound wall. </p>
<p>5        Pandi gave evidence that he called the

police three times in total. At 2.40 am, two police officers arrived at the scene, PW2 Sgt

Zulkarnaian ("Sgt Zul") and PW3 Cpl Azhar Sukaimi ("Cpl Azhar"). Upon

their arrival, Pandi told them that he had been robbed and assaulted by the appellant,

whereupon the appellant was placed under arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">6        On 9 January 2002, Pandi

returned to the scene of crime with the Investigating Officer, PW3, Cpl M. Saravanan

("Cpl Saravanan"). Whilst inside the ‘Cheers’ outlet, they met Kumar,

who was coincidentally there as well. Cpl Saravanan overheard Kumar asking Pandi

"what happened the other night. Are you ok?". When Pandi identified Kumar as the

second Indian man on the night that he was robbed and assaulted, Kumar was also placed

under arrest by Cpl Saravanan.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The appellant’s defence</p></i></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The appellant maintained

that on the night of 7 January 2002 he was with Kumar at a coffee shop at Blk 291 Yishun

Ring Road, drinking alcoholic drinks with some friends. Prior to that, he had taken some

Chinese wines at home. Subsequently, the appellant and Kumar went to another coffee shop

at Blk 285 to meet other friends. From the coffee shop, the appellant gave evidence that

he and Kumar moved off to the ‘Cheers’ outlet. He could not recall the time they

arrived at the outlet.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        A CCTV recording together

with a set of 10 still photographs taken from the recording, were produced by the defence

and admitted in court. They were taken from the video cameras at the ‘Cheers’

outlet, facing the cashier, the side entrance and the main entrance. One of the

photographs had shown the appellant wheeling his bicycle, near the side entrance of the

‘Cheers’ outlet, at about 12 midnight.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The appellant testified

that he and Kumar had gone to the compound wall outside the front entrance of the

‘Cheers’ outlet, near a blue dustbin and sat down. He took another drink.

Because of all the alcoholic drinks he had, as well as some Chinese wines he had drunk at

home prior to setting off for the coffee shop, he dozed off. He only woke up at about 2

am. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        When the appellant was

told that the CCTV recording showed that he was seen going towards the side entrance of

the ‘Cheers’ outlet at about 2.17 am and joining Kumar, the appellant testified

that both of them had intended to go home, and he was pushing his bicycle. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Both of them then moved

off from the scene. According to the appellant, he had not noticed the presence of Pandi.

After Kumar left, the appellant returned to the scene with his bicycle, intending to rest

further before going home. It was then that Pandi came up to him and threatened to

"finish him off". Being terrified, he rushed into the ‘Cheers’ outlet

to call the police. He testified that the staff at the ‘Cheers’ outlet called

the police for him on his behalf and he too called the police from inside the

‘Cheers’ outlet. While waiting inside the store for the police to arrive,

suddenly, someone from outside came and pushed him and he fell outside the store.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        When the police arrived,

he went towards them and complained of the threat on his life by Pandi. However, he was

arrested and charged for jointly committing robbery of $50 and hurting Pandi.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></i>
<p xmlns="">13        The district judge was of the view that he

had no valid reason to disbelieve Pandi and accepted his evidence that he was robbed and

assaulted. He rejected the defence of the appellant and Kumar that they were not involved

in robbing and causing hurt to Pandi as he had difficulty in accepting various aspects of

their evidence and that they had contradicted each other on the following material aspects

of the case :-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i whether the appellant was sleeping at the compound wall at the

    material time;</p>
<p align="justify">ii whether the appellant was at all aware of the presence of Pandi at

    the compound wall at the material time;</p>
<p align="justify">iii whether Pandi had seen Kumar at all at the compound wall at the

    material time.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        The district judge found

that the appellant and Kumar had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution’s case and convicted them of the charge, sentencing them to six years

imprisonment each. In view of the age of the appellant and Kumar, who were both over 50

years old, no sentence of caning was imposed.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        For the charge under s 394

of the Penal Code to be made out, the prosecution had to prove the following elements

against the appellant; first, that the appellant committed robbery of $50 in the

possession of Pandi and secondly, that the appellant voluntarily caused hurt in doing so,

by slapping Pandi twice on the cheek.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        Before me, counsel for the

appellant’s submissions were essentially that on the totality of the evidence before

the district judge, the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and

that the district judge had erred in fact and in law to hold so. Counsel for the appellant

further urged this court to review and examine the evidence in order to come to an

independent finding on each issue of fact.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        The principles applicable

whenever an appellate court carries out the unenviable task of evaluating a trial

judge’s findings of fact are well entrenched. It is trite law that an appellate court

will not disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge unless they can be shown to be

against the weight of evidence : <i>Ng Soo Hin v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7875&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 105</a>. If the appellate

court wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, it must not merely entertain

doubts as to whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong : <i>PP

v Poh Oh Sim </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4800&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 3 MLJ 416</a>; <i>PP v Azman bin Abdullah </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46369&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 704</a>.

Nevertheless, while an appellate court should be reluctant to interfere with a finding of

fact, it is always free to form an independent opinion about the proper inference to be

drawn from a finding of fact. The circumstances of this case required me to keep this

firmly in mind and, having lay out the principles, I will now move on to examine the

evidence proper.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the district judge had totally failed to appreciate that the first

information report (FIR) of Pandi was contrary to his evidence in court. The time that

this FIR was made was recorded at 02.21.40 on 8 January 2002 and the text read "Two

Indian man unknown to me stole my special pass and running off". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        The first thing to note

about the FIR was that it was conspicuously silent on the loss of $50 through robbery and

the slapping incident. No doubt, the main purpose of an FIR is merely to give information

of a cognizable offence to set the police in motion and need not contain the entire case

for the prosecution : <i>Tan Pin Seng v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44204&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 418</a>; <i>PP v Pardeep Singh </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48673&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 116</a>. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that omissions in the FIR would always be of no

significance, since the FIR, while not being substantive evidence, is after all a piece of

corroborative evidence. Omissions as to material facts in the FIR could, <i>ceteris

paribus</i>, deprive the prosecution of the most valuable corroboration and thereby make

the complainant’s story suspicious : <i>Herchun Singh v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7890&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1969] 2 MLJ 209</a>. I

further noted that in the present case the FIR did not contain mere omissions of material

facts, but that the offence disclosed in it had been entirely inconsistent with that of

which the appellant was charged and convicted, in relation to both the act and the subject

matter of the offence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        At paragraph 198 of his

judgment, the district judge stated that he did not regard this inconsistency as a major

one, discrediting the victim’s evidence completely. He dealt with the inconsistency

as such :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">it appeared to me that having been convicted as an

    illegal immigrant, the victim was more concerned at that time about his Special Pass. Even

    in his evidence in chief, the victim stated that he asked [the appellant] to at least

    return his Special Pass. He told [the appellant] that "they can keep the money".</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        With due respect to the

district judge, in drawing such an inference, he had failed completely to consider that

the special pass allegedly taken away from Pandi was merely <i>a copy </i>of the original.

Cpl Saravanan confirmed that Pandi had produced the original special pass on 9 January

2002 at the police station. To concentrate, in making the call to the police, on the theft

or robbery of <i>a copy </i>of the special pass, when a relatively large sum was taken

away (Pandi earns $10 a day as a cleaner at the Seletar Golf Country Club) and hurt was

caused, seemed to me to be open to doubt.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        In addition, even though

Pandi had mentioned in P3 that the two Indian men were "running off", he

testified during trial that the appellant was in a drunken stupor and, after robbing and

assaulting him, the appellant had walked with faltering steps to join Kumar, who had moved

away towards the shop next to the ‘Cheers’ outlet. Pandi confirmed in court that

he did not see anybody running off and that he was keeping an eye over the appellant when

making the call to the police, as he was worried that the appellant would run away. It was

also his evidence that, after he finished the call, he turned around and saw the appellant

walking to and fro, even though Kumar was no longer at the scene.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        During his testimony in

court, Pandi attempted to explain that he did tell the police during the call that

"my special pass go already, my $50 go already". Even if I were to accept that

this was so and that there were communication difficulties due to Pandi’s mother

tongue being Tamil, it did not make any sense that the location, like the text, should be

incorrect as well. This was because of what was revealed when Pandi was cross-examined on

the inconsistencies in the FIR:</p>
<i xmlns=""><font size="3">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q :    I am asking you about the first time when you

    called the police. P3 (the FIR) was shown to you and the caller’s name was Pandi and

    you confirmed that it was you.</p>
<p align="justify">A:    Yes, but I did not mention anything about the

    location.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font></i>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><font size="3"><p align="justify">Q:    You took 2 to 3 minutes to tell

    them two Indian men took your pass and ran off.</p>
<p align="justify">A:    I could not communicate in English and I was

    stammering and stuttering. They managed to trace the location of the phone from the number

    I called.</p>
</font></i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        Pandi had stated quite

clearly that he had not mentioned anything about the location. If it was true that nothing

was mentioned about the location, the logical conclusion to draw from that must be that

the police had managed to trace the call, since the location in the FIR was clearly stated

as "301, Yishun Ave 2, 769093, Yishun Mrt stn". And yet this was not the correct

location where the alleged offence of robbery with hurt, was committed. This raised some

suspicions as to whether Pandi was, altogether, a truthful witness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        In my view, the

inconsistencies relating to the FIR could not be lightly disregarded, affecting the

credibility of Pandi to a large extent. The district judge was not able to reach the same

conclusion as me, with respect to the credibility of Pandi, as he had placed insufficient

weight on the inconsistencies between the FIR and Pandi’s evidence in court. It

followed that Pandi’s evidence should be placed under greater scrutiny, especially

when the prosecution’s case rested primarily on his evidence that it was the

appellant who had robbed him of $50 and slapped him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        The circumstances under

which the police came to arrive at Blk 291 Yishun Ring Road, where the alleged offence

took place, further complicated the case for the prosecution. Cpl Saravanan gave evidence

that when the police were dispatched to Yishun MRT station, they found no sign of a case

there. Another mobile patrol was able to arrive at the correct location, at the

‘Cheers’ outlet, only because of the FIR of the appellant, who had called the

police at 2.35 am on 8 January 2002 from the ‘Cheers’ outlet itself. Sgt Zul and

Cpl Azhar, who arrived at the scene, testified that the appellant was waiting for them

outside the ‘Cheers’ outlet and he approached them first, followed by Pandi. In

my view, the actions of the appellant in waiting for and approaching the police were

certainly not consistent with those of someone who had just committed an offence of

robbery with hurt. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        No doubt, it seemed

strange that the appellant should complain of a threat on his life by someone who was a

stranger to him. However, to draw the conclusion from that, as the district judge did,

that the appellant must have seen Pandi calling the police and called the police as well

in order to avoid any suspicions, was erroneous for the simple reason that it was

unsupported by any evidence. There was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant had seen

Pandi making a call, not to mention a call to the police. In fact, it was Pandi’s own

evidence that, whilst he was making the call to the police, the appellant had walked with

faltering steps towards Kumar, as he (the appellant) was drunk. It was highly improbable

that, while being drunk and unsteady on his feet, the appellant still managed to observe

Pandi making a call at the telephone booth, concluded that it was a call to the police and

then devised his own strategy to call the police in order to throw them off his tracks. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        In relation to the copy of

the special pass, there was no evidence to corroborate that it had been burnt by the

appellant or that it even existed at all. Sgt Zul confirmed that he searched the area at

the scene that night for evidence of any burnt paper but was unable to find anything. Cpl

Saravanan testified that, when he went to the scene the following day, the place had

already been washed and cleaned, so he would not know whether there was any evidence of

any burnt paper. Before me, the prosecution submitted that it was not at all surprising

that the police officers were unable to find anything since it was in the early hours of

the morning and ash was essentially what they were looking for. I must say, however, that

the evidence on this point was rather equivocal and any reservations as to whether the

special pass had indeed been burnt by the appellant should be resolved in favour of the

appellant, since the prosecution bore the burden of proof.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        The $50 that was allegedly

robbed from Pandi was also never recovered. Sgt Zul and Cpl Azhar testified that they had

each conducted a search on the appellant at the scene that night but both of them were

unable to find anything other than a lighter, cigarettes and some personal belongings. In

the district judge’s view, that the $50 note from the victim was never found did not

mean that the victim was not robbed of the $50. He went on further to say (at para 188) :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">it is pertinent to note here that after B1 (the

    appellant) had physically robbed the victim, he was seen going towards B2 (Kumar). B1 had

    testified that he did go away with B2 before returning to the scene, while B2 had

    completely disappeared from the scene.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        The district judge then

drew the inference that the appellant must have given the cash to Kumar as there was no

one else who was seen near the appellant and Kumar. Such an inference presupposed that the

appellant had indeed robbed Pandi of the $50 note. With due respect to the district judge,

this was unsupported by any evidence and should be rejected for being entirely

speculative. Even though I agreed with the prosecution that there is really no rule of law

that the fruits of a crime must be recovered before the charge against an accused is

proven, I was of the view that, taking into account the surrounding circumstances of this

case and the need to place a greater scrutiny on Pandi’s evidence, the failure to

recover the $50 from the appellant considerably weakened the prosecution’s case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31        Next, I come to

Pandi’s claim that the appellant had slapped him twice on his cheek. Pandi testified

in court that the appellant had used his right hand to slap him. There is no medical

evidence to corroborate this allegation other than the testimony of Sgt Zul, who informed

the court that both the cheeks of Pandi were swollen. Cpl Azhar gave evidence that he had

not been able to see clearly whether Pandi had any visible injury, as it was dark. As for

Cpl Saravanan, he testified that, when he first saw Pandi on 9 January 2002, he did not

see any swelling. Pandi informed Cpl Saravanan that he did not seek medical attention, as

he did not know that the cost would be borne by the police and thought that he would have

to pay.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the district judge erred in that Sgt Zul’s testimony should not be

relied upon as the basis to find that hurt was caused to Pandi. It was further submitted

that hurt, pain and swelling are issues requiring proof by medical experts and Sgt Zul was

not a doctor who could testify on this crucial aspect of the case against the appellant. I

was unable to accept this contention. Whether hurt is caused, is a finding of fact, which

is not necessarily to be always corroborated by evidence given by medical experts. A trial

judge is entitled to find that hurt has been caused, with or without medical evidence, if

he is convinced that it has been proven, in light of all the evidence before him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33        In the present case, it

was the evidence of Pandi that there was a passer-by at the scene that night, who was

watching the whole incident from a distance. He testified that it was the passer-by who

had advised him to call the police. He further testified that the passer-by had pushed the

appellant to the ground and that he went forward to try and help the appellant up but was

brushed aside. When asked during cross-examination why he still wanted to help the

appellant up when the appellant had robbed and slapped him, Pandi replied that it was the

passer-by who asked him to help the appellant up. The appellant confirmed that someone had

pushed him while he was waiting in the ‘Cheers’ outlet for the police to arrive

and that he fell outside the store as a result. This was corroborated by the CCTV

recording. The still photograph at 02:42:39 showed a man in a vertically-striped shirt

with his hand on the appellant’s shoulder. The next still photograph at 02:42:43

showed the appellant on the ground. The same man in the vertically-striped shirt was seen

talking to the police, in the still photograph at 02:46:56. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34        By Pandi’s own

account, this passer-by was there all the while, being the only one at the scene that

night other than himself, Kumar and the appellant. In my view, the passer-by was very much

a material witness. Since he was at the scene and had, apparently, observed the entire

incident, he would have been able to witness <i>the appellant slapping Pandi.</i> The

passer-by would also have been able to shed some light as to why he had pushed the

appellant to the ground and then subsequently asked Pandi to help him up. The failure on

the part of the prosecution to call such a material witness to give evidence, entitled me

to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act

(Cap 97). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35        It was true that the

appellant was not able to give proper explanations, with respect to his actions during the

material time and, in this regard, his defence was not entirely up to scratch. He claimed

to have dozed off while Kumar gave evidence in court that between 12 midnight and 2 am on

8 January 2002, they had been conversing on family and personal problems. The

appellant’s evidence was also inconsistent with Kumar’s, as to whether the

appellant was aware of the presence of Pandi and whether Kumar had seen Pandi at all

outside the ‘Cheers’ outlet. It must be remembered, however, that the appellant

had been somewhat intoxicated at the material time and during his testimony in court,

Pandi had confirmed several times the appellant’s state of intoxication. It was not

improbable that his account of the events could be somewhat affected by his intoxication.

More importantly, the burden of proof was still on the prosecution to prove the

appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, however tenuous the defence might have

been : <i>Tan Edmund v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9127&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 102</a>. In discharging this burden, it was not at

all sufficient for the prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the

appellant’s testimony.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36        Having examined the

evidence carefully and assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the view that, even

though the appellant was unable to establish an affirmative defence to prove his

innocence, his conviction was unsafe and an acquittal would be in order, as the

prosecution had not succeeded in proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt : <i>Tan Buck

Tee v PP </i>[1961] MLJ 176; <i>Ang Kah Kee v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63031&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 2 SLR 104</a>. The FIR was full of

inaccuracies. Neither the special pass nor the $50 note was ever recovered by the police.

The prosecution also failed to call a material witness to corroborate Pandi’s version

of events, even though it was claimed by Pandi that the material witness had watched the

entire incident and had advised Pandi to call the police. In the circumstances, I allowed

the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence.</p>
