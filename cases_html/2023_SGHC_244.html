</div> Furthermore, the nature of international arbitration was that many Singapore-seated arbitrations often had no connection with Singapore apart from it being chosen as the arbitral seat.

</div> To allow such connecting factors to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the Singapore courts to enforce a tribunal’s interim orders would be to deprive many Singapore-seated international arbitrations of the curial assistance under s 12(6) of the IAA that Parliament intended them to have, and that parties themselves reasonably expected to be available to them.

The defendants do not dispute this. Indeed, such jurisdiction is clear from the provisions set out above. Under s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IAA, an arbitral tribunal has the power to order a domestic interim measure. The jurisdiction to hear an application to enforce domestic interim measures stems from s 12(6) of the IAA, which applies to orders or directions made in a Singapore-seated arbitration. Such orders and directions shall, by leave of the High Court or a Judge thereof, be enforceable in the same manner as if they were orders made by a court: see <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels Inc and another v Global Gaming Philippines LLC and another </span>[2021] 2 SLR 1279 (“<span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [113].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Further, the choice of seat embodies parties’ submission to the curial jurisdiction of the seat’s courts. As observed by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi </span><span class="font-italic">A S v OOO “Insurance Company Chubb” and others </span>[2020] EWCA Civ 574 (“<span class="font-italic">Enka EWCA</span>”) at [46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he choice of seat is by its very nature a submission to the curial jurisdiction. The choice of seat is a legal concept which determines the curial law … [t]o hold that the choice of seat is a submission to the curial jurisdiction is therefore no more than to give effect to party autonomy which is fundamental to arbitration agreements and which it is the primary function of the courts to respect and uphold. Parties who agree a particular seat deliberately submit themselves to the law of the seat and whatever control it exerts. That not only gives effect to party autonomy but promotes certainty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thus, where parties have chosen Singapore as the seat of the arbitration, as they have here, they agree to submit to the curial law and jurisdiction of Singapore.

</div>
</div> As stated above at [31], arbitral tribunals in Singapore-seated international arbitrations derive their power to order an interim injunction or any other interim measure from s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IAA. However, an arbitral tribunal does not have the same coercive powers of enforcement as the court. To preserve the sanctity of the interim orders and directions issued by the arbitral tribunal, the enforcement of these measures becomes the responsibility of the supervising national courts, at the application of one or more of the parties: <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts </span>at [113]–[114].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Section 12(6) of the IAA is the operative provision under which parties apply for permission to enforce interim measures issued in a Singapore-seated arbitration. Section 12(6) was introduced to address a “lacuna” in the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) (which has the force of law in Singapore under s 3(1) of the IAA) in that the Model Law did not expressly provide that an interim measure could be enforced as an award: see the <span class="font-italic">Report on Review of Arbitration Laws </span>(August 1993) prepared by the Law Reform Committee’s Sub-Committee on Review of Arbitration Laws (“the LRC Report”) at para 32. Lee Seiu Kin J observed this point in <span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu Indah and others v Newmont Indonesia Ltd and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Pukuafu</span>”) (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… During the drafting stages of the International Arbitration Bill, the Law Reform Committee’s sub-committee (“the sub-committee”) on the Review of Arbitration Laws proposed that assistance should be available from the courts when interim orders are made by an arbitral tribunal so as to ensure that such orders are not mere paper awards. Article 17 of the Model Law gives an arbitral tribunal powers to make orders on interim measures of protection but is silent on the status and enforceability of such orders. The sub-committee considered that the Model Law had left a lacuna in this aspect and that “such orders may also need to be given the status of awards in order to be enforceable” (at [34] of the sub-committee’s report on the Review of Arbitration Laws). Parliament responded by providing in s 12(6) of the IAA that “[all] orders or directions made or given by an arbitral tribunal in the course of an arbitration shall, by leave of the High Court or a Judge thereof, be enforceable in the same manner as if they were orders made by a court”, thus filling in the lacuna with a <span class="font-italic">sui generis </span>enforcement mechanism …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The need to seek the court’s permission under s 12(6) necessarily means that the court has the <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> whether to grant permission. Therefore, the court’s role cannot be to simply “rubber-stamp” its approval. But the IAA does not prescribe how that discretion is to be exercised. The IAA provisions addressing domestic interim measures and their enforcement sheds some, but insufficient, light on this question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The IAA differentiates interim measures ordered under s 12 from <span class="font-italic">awards</span>. Interim measures do not determine the merits of the dispute between parties but seek to preserve parties’ rights pending the final determination of the dispute by the tribunal. Thus, s 2(1) of the IAA defines “award” to mean “a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the dispute [which] includes any interim, interlocutory or partial award <span class="font-italic">but excludes</span> any orders or directions made under section 12”. By virtue of s 2(2) of the IAA, which provides that “a word … used both in this Part and in the Model Law … has, in the Model Law, the meaning given by this Part”, this definition of “award” applies to the Model Law as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The significance of this statutory distinction is that procedural and interim measures issued by a tribunal under s 12(1) are exempt from the usual judicial oversight which applies to awards under the IAA and the Model Law. In particular, the grounds for setting aside an award under Art 34(2) of the Model Law <span class="font-italic">do not</span> apply to domestic interim measures under s 12(6) of the IAA. Neither does s 24 of the IAA, which provides two additional grounds for the setting aside of a Singapore-seated award – if (a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or (b) a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thus, Lee J in <span class="font-italic">Pukuafu</span> noted (at [21]) that by introducing s 12(6) of the IAA, Parliament had instituted “a <span class="font-italic">sui generis </span>enforcement mechanism [for orders under s 12] without broadening the definition of “award” to allow the court to set aside these orders”. This approach reflected Parliament’s decision to insulate these orders from judicial challenge while lending the coercive powers of the court to their enforcement: <span class="font-italic">Pukuafu </span>at [22]. Thus, the court has no jurisdiction under the IAA to set aside or review interim measures made by an arbitral tribunal. Limiting challenges only to awards that decide the substantive merits of the case would reduce the risk of delay and prevent tactical attempts to obstruct the arbitration process by bringing challenges on interim orders: <span class="font-italic">Pukuafu </span>at [25]. It also reflected the principle that procedural issues fall directly within the province of the arbitral tribunal and should be decided solely by the tribunal: <span class="font-italic">Pukuafu </span>at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Indeed, at the drafting stage, the regime for enforcement of interim measures was envisioned to be largely free from judicial interference. The LRC Report, which was adopted by Parliament, recommended (at para 35) that “curial assistance should be available such that the interim orders and/or directions may be registered with the courts for enforcement <span class="font-italic">as an administrative process</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The only express condition is found in O 48 r 5(2) of the ROC 2021, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Enforcement of interim orders or directions (O. 48, r. 5)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Where the order sought to be enforced is in the nature of an interim injunction under section 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">f</span>), permission may be granted only if the applicant undertakes to abide by any order the Court or the arbitral tribunal may make as to damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Interim Order is one made under s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the IAA and therefore, this condition does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, the imposition of this condition for interim injunctions under ss 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the IAA does not mean that the court <span class="font-italic">must</span> grant enforcement in all other cases – as stated above at [41], enforcement is an exercise of the court’s <span class="font-italic">discretion</span>. Nor does it inform how the discretion under s 12(6) of the IAA should be exercised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Nevertheless, drawing on the background and context of s 12(6) of the IAA as explored above, the threshold to obtain the court’s permission must necessarily be a <span class="font-italic">low</span> one:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) as stated above, it was envisaged that the obtaining of the court’s permission under s 12(6) would be “administrative”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an interim measure, by definition, does not determine the merits of the dispute between the parties but seeks to preserve the parties’ rights pending the final determination of the dispute by the tribunal;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the clear policy and intent of the IAA is for minimal curial intervention, and for the court to assist arbitral proceedings, which includes the enforcement of interim measures, directions and, ultimately, awards;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the court is not concerned with the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of the interim measure; indeed, unlike the case of an award, the IAA does not give the court power to even set aside or review interim measures made by the arbitral tribunal; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) as previously observed, the court should eschew any principle or approach which risks delay or allows tactical attempts to obstruct the arbitration process (<span class="font-italic">Pukuafu </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Do FNC principles apply?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I now turn to the thrust of the defendant’s case, namely that FNC principles are relevant to the question of whether it is appropriate for the court to exercise jurisdiction over an application to enforce a domestic interim measure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As a preliminary point, I note that the claimants went beyond arguing that it was <span class="font-italic">appropriate</span> for the court to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the Leave Application. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments</span>, they argued that because this was a Singapore-seated arbitration, the court was in fact <span class="font-italic">obliged</span> to hear the Leave Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The claimants’ submission in this respect goes too far. In <span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments</span>, the application before the court challenged the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> of the arbitral tribunal. It was in this context that Sundaresh Menon CJ held at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no doubt … that the interpretation and application of the [agreement] are matters that are entirely within the scope of what the Singapore courts had to deal with in this case. Indeed, we would say that the High Court was not only competent to consider these issues, but in the circumstances, it was <span class="font-italic">obliged </span>to do so. This is so because the parties have designated Singapore as the seat of the Arbitration … A necessary consequence of this is that the IAA applies to govern the Arbitration and this in turn <span class="font-italic">requires </span>the High Court to consider issues such as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Where the <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction </span>of the arbitral tribunal is concerned, the court of the seat is <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span> charged with the duty to pronounce on the matter (following an appeal against the tribunal’s own decision on jurisdiction): see s 10(3) IAA. This is a crucial component of supervisory jurisdiction, and parties would be left with no recourse against the tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction if the court of the seat were to abdicate this duty. Hence, the court of the seat is obliged to consider issues such as the jurisdiction of the tribunal. On the other hand, the enforcement of domestic interim measures is not an issue which the court of the seat has exclusive jurisdiction to hear. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Judicial authority</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Returning to the issue of the relevance of FNC principles, the claimants relied on the UK Supreme Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi AS v OOO Insurance Company Chubb and others </span>[2020] UKSC 38 (“<span class="font-italic">Enka UKSC</span>”) for the proposition that FNC principles are <span class="font-italic">not</span> relevant to the court’s exercise of jurisdiction over an application to enforce a local interim measure. The court in <span class="font-italic">Enka UKSC </span>held as follows (at [179]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We agree with the Court of Appeal that forum conveniens, which is a matter that goes to the court’s jurisdiction, is <span class="font-italic">not relevant</span>. By agreeing to arbitrate in London the parties were agreeing to <span class="font-italic">submit to the supervisory and supporting </span><span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> of the English courts, including its jurisdiction to grant anti-suit injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The claimants contended that the enforcement of domestic interim measures was also part of the <span class="font-italic">supervisory</span> jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, and hence in line with the holding in <span class="font-italic">Enka UKSC</span>, FNC principles were not relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In response, the defendants argued that the powers that are exclusive to a supervisory court are listed at Art 6 of the Model Law, which does not include the enforcement of a domestic interim measure; accordingly, the enforcement of a domestic interim measure was not a power exclusive to the seat court and hence Singapore being the seat court did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that the Singapore court is the appropriate enforcement court.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The scope of supervisory jurisdiction is <span class="font-italic">not </span>founded on Art 6 of the Model Law. The provision reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Article 6.  Court or other authority for certain functions of arbitration assistance and supervision</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The functions referred to in Articles 11(3), 11(4), 13(3), 14, 16(3) and 34(2) shall be performed by ........... [Each State enacting this Model Law specifies the court, courts or, where referred to therein, other authority competent to perform these functions.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This provision was meant to allow the legislature of a State to designate the relevant court which would perform the functions referred to in the specified articles. The title of Art 6 itself, which reads “<span class="font-italic">certain</span> functions of arbitration assistance and supervision” [emphasis added] indicates that the provision was not meant to exhaustively list the supervisory powers of the national courts. Thus, it has been observed that (Howard Holtzmann and Joseph Neuhaus, <span class="font-italic">A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration </span>(Wolters Kluwer, 2015) at p 240):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 6 enables the legislature of a State enacting the Model Law to designate which court or authority in the State is to perform certain functions under the Law … its primary purpose is to aid foreign parties in locating the competent court or authority and obtaining information on its procedures and practices … Not all court functions under the Law are included in the designation under Article 6 …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clearly, Art 6 does not delineate the scope of supervisory jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 At the same time, the claimants’ contention that the enforcement of domestic interim measures forms part of the Singapore courts’ <span class="font-italic">supervisory</span> jurisdiction is not accurate. The supervisory jurisdiction of the courts of the seat concerns powers unique to the courts of the seat, which they possess for the purpose of <span class="font-italic">supervising</span> the arbitral proceedings: see <span class="font-italic">Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings v Anupam Mittal </span>[2021] SGHC 244 (“<span class="font-italic">Westbridge</span>”) at [73]. Such powers include the power to set aside awards, as well as the oversight which the courts of the seat have over, for example, challenges against the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal under s 10 of the IAA. The enforcement of interim measures ordered by the arbitral tribunal does <span class="font-italic">not </span>form part of the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. It is not a power unique to the courts of the seat and it does not concern the court’s supervision of the arbitral proceedings. Thus, the holding in <span class="font-italic">Enka UKSC</span> that FNC principles do not apply to the court’s exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not strictly on point in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Overall, the authorities do not appear to address specifically the issue of whether FNC principles apply to the enforcement of domestic interim measures. Hence, I turn to consider the nature and purpose of the FNC doctrine and if or how it maps onto the enforcement of domestic interim measures under s 12(6) of the IAA. For reasons discussed below, I find that FNC principles do not apply to the enforcement of domestic interim measures.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">FNC considerations are irrelevant to the enforcement paradigm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendants’ argument fundamentally misunderstands and misapplies FNC principles. In essence, they wrongly conflate a “proper” and an “appropriate” forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The court will only grant a stay on FNC grounds where it is satisfied that there is <span class="font-italic">some other </span>available and appropriate forum for the trial of the action: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [14], citing <span class="font-italic">Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 851 at [19]. Thus, the purpose of the FNC analysis is to identify the <span class="font-italic">most appropriate forum </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the proper forum)<span class="font-italic"> </span>to hear the substantive dispute: <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]. The court therefore considers which forum the material elements of the dispute (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the parties, governing law, evidence, and witnesses) are most closely connected to, such that the case may be tried more suitably in that forum for the interest of all the parties and the ends of justice: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [13], citing <span class="font-italic">Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services Indonesia </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 345 at [35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, the nature and purpose of a FNC inquiry is simply ill-suited to applications for the enforcement of domestic interim measures. First, FNC principles are concerned with the <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> dispute at hand – hence the focus on the factors connecting the substantive dispute to a particular jurisdiction, such as the availability of witnesses and evidence. This focus on the substantive dispute is necessary to ascertain the single, most appropriate forum for determining the dispute: <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG </span>at [4].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Where the enforcement of domestic interim measures is concerned, the court is <span class="font-italic">not </span>concerned with adjudicating the <span class="font-italic">substantive merits</span> of the dispute or the interim measure itself. The court is therefore <span class="font-italic">not </span>concerned with the typical connecting factors which a particular forum has to the dispute. Further, the aim of the FNC doctrine – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to identify the single, most appropriate forum for determining the substantive dispute – makes little sense in the enforcement paradigm, since an enforcement application can be brought in multiple jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Put another way, just because it may be appropriate, or even more effective, to enforce the Interim Order in Malaysia or some other jurisdiction, it does not mean that Singapore is not an appropriate forum to hear the Leave Application. This same reasoning applied in <span class="font-italic">U &amp; M Mining Zambia Ltd v Konkola Copper Mines plc </span>[2014] EWHC 3250 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">U &amp; M</span>”), albeit in the context of a court-ordered worldwide freezing injunction granted in support of sums awarded by a London-seated arbitral tribunal. Although the enforcement of the injunction was almost entirely linked to Zambia rather than England (since the bulk of the relevant assets were in Zambia and there were no relevant assets in England), Teare J held that (at [63] and [65] of <span class="font-italic">U &amp; M</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63. … the mere fact that enforcement of an award will take place in Zambia is, by itself, <span class="font-italic">insufficient to make it inappropriate</span> for this court, being the court of the place where the arbitration has its seat, to grant [the injunction] …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65. This is a case where it is appropriate for two courts to grant a freezing order against KCM … I <span class="font-italic">do not accept</span> that the fact that it may be appropriate for another court to grant a freezing order means that it is inappropriate for this court to do so …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, where it comes to enforcement of an interim order, the fact that the courts of one forum may also enforce such an order does not impact the appropriateness of the courts of another forum. FNC principles are therefore irrelevant to the assessment of the appropriate court to hear applications for the enforcement of domestic interim measures.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of FNC principles contradicts party autonomy and certainty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The application of FNC principles is also antithetical, in a practical sense, to the question of whether it is appropriate for this court to exercise jurisdiction over the enforcement of domestic interim measures under s 12(6) of the IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The common practice, and reality, in international arbitrations is that the chosen seat may have little or even no connection with the parties or the dispute; its choice may turn on, or reflect the parties’ confidence in, the legal infrastructure of the seat, the national curial law and willingness of the courts to support and facilitate the arbitration. Indeed, the lack of connecting factors to, and the neutrality of, the seat may be the precise reason why the parties chose that very seat: see <span class="font-italic">Westbridge </span>at [92]. Applying FNC principles to enforcement would be contrary to party autonomy and the expectations of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Applying FNC principles would also introduce uncertainty. The application of FNC, which involves multi-factorial considerations, is often a complicated and unpredictable exercise. If the defendants are correct, the “appropriate” jurisdiction to enforce an interim measure would not only be unclear from the outset, it may also engage different jurisdictions depending on the nature and terms of the interim measure to be enforced. It therefore presents ample opportunity for a respondent to engage in delay and tactical attempts to obstruct the arbitration process, which is the very mischief s 12(6) seeks to avoid: see <span class="font-italic">Pukuafu </span>at [25]. Such an outcome would potentially make Singapore a less attractive seat for international arbitrations: see Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration </span>(3rd Ed, Wolters Kluwer, 2012) at para 14.02[A][6].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legitimate reasons and practical benefits for seeking enforcement at the seat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, there may be legitimate reasons and practical benefits for seeking enforcement at the court of the seat. First, parties may have chosen the arbitral seat for the very reason of the seat jurisdiction’s approach toward enforcing awards (used in the loose sense of the term and including interim measures). The court in <span class="font-italic">Enka</span><span class="font-italic"> EWCA</span> stated at [48] that “preferences for seats are predominantly based on users’ appraisal of the seat’s established formal legal infrastructure: the neutrality and impartiality of the legal system; the national arbitration law; and its <span class="font-italic">track record for enforcing agreements to arbitrate and arbitral awards</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, the seat court’s grant of enforcement dispels any potential for a future challenge to the award on procedural grounds. As observed by the court in <span class="font-italic">Shell Energy Europe Ltd v Meta Energia SpA </span>[2020] EWHC 1799 (Comm) at [17]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n the context of the international enforcement of an arbitration award, there is an <span class="font-italic">inherent value</span> in there being confirmation from the court of the seat … that the award in question is fully valid, effective and enforceable according to the law governing the arbitral process, and that there was and is no basis for a challenge to the award on 'due process' grounds under that law. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This inherent value in seeking and obtaining enforcement at the court of the seat makes it practical and reasonable for parties to do so, irrespective of considerations such as the ease of enforcement at the seat jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Foreign interim measures</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The above analysis, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that FNC principles are not relevant to the assessment of the appropriate court to hear applications for the enforcement of domestic interim measures, is supported by the provisions in the IAA relating to the enforcement of tribunal-ordered interim measures in foreign-seated international arbitrations (“foreign interim measures”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Under Part 3 of the IAA, which addresses foreign awards, an “arbitral award” includes an order or a direction made or given by an arbitral tribunal in the course of an arbitration in respect of any of the matters set out in ss 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)–12(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the IAA. Hence, the distinction between an “interim measure” and an “award” which applies for Singapore-seated arbitrations (as noted above at [42]) does not apply for foreign-seated arbitrations. In other words, a foreign “award” includes a foreign interim measure, and therefore IAA provisions addressing foreign awards deal with foreign interim measures as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Under O 48 r 6 of the ROC 2021, a party may apply for permission to enforce a foreign award (which includes an interim measure) without notice and is not required to state in its affidavit why Singapore is an appropriate forum for enforcement. Nor is it even required, under O 48 r 6(4), to seek leave to serve the order giving permission out of jurisdiction. This underscores the irrelevance of a FNC assessment in respect of the enforcement of a foreign interim measure in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Further, under O 48 r 6(5) of the ROC 2021, the respondent may apply to set aside the order giving permission. Section 31(1) of the IAA provides that enforcement of a foreign award may only be refused in cases mentioned in ss 31(2) and 31(4) of the IAA, <span class="font-italic">but </span><span class="font-italic">not otherwise</span>. Sections 31(2) and 31(4) of the IAA basically enshrine the same grounds for refusing enforcement of an award as Art 36 of the Model Law (although it should be noted that Art 36 of the Model Law, being part of Chapter VIII of the Model Law, is not given force of law in Singapore pursuant to s 3(1) of the IAA). These grounds mostly relate to procedural and jurisdictional objections to the arbitral proceedings, such as the invalidity of the arbitration agreement or the inability of a party to present its case in the proceedings. There is no reference to FNC considerations as a ground for refusal of enforcement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In contrast, Parliament did not see fit to prescribe <span class="font-italic">any </span>grounds to refuse the enforcement of domestic interim measures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Logically, Parliament could not have intended that the court’s discretion to refuse enforcement of a domestic interim measure would be wider than that for a foreign interim measure. Singapore-seated international arbitrations are subject to the curial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts and the accompanying supervision which the Singapore courts are empowered to impose on such arbitrations pursuant to the IAA. In contrast, foreign-seated international arbitrations are not subject to the supervision of the Singapore courts at all. Given this, it is reasonable to expect that the statutory position toward the enforcement of foreign interim measures would be <span class="font-italic">more restrictive</span> than that toward the enforcement of domestic interim measures. This expectation is indeed borne out by the actual structure of the IAA, which, as noted above, provides various grounds for refusing the enforcement of a foreign interim measure but none for the enforcement of a domestic interim measure. The imposition of more judicial scrutiny on the enforcement of domestic interim measures would also be inconsistent with the general policy of making such enforcement an expeditious, “administrative” process, as evidenced by the carving out of domestic interim measures from the setting-aside regime for domestic awards under the IAA as well as the LRC Report’s comments (noted above at [44]–[45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the circumstances, in so far as FNC considerations are irrelevant in the context of the enforcement of foreign interim measures, which they plainly are, there is no good reason for applying such considerations to the court’s exercise of jurisdiction in respect of domestic interim measures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The only limb that could possibly assist the defendants is s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the enforcement of the foreign award would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. The ambit of “public policy” will be discussed later at [112]–[116]. It suffices to say for now that this doctrine is a strict and narrow one, including, for example, the situation where enforcement “shocks the conscience” or “violates Singapore’s most basic notion of justice”: <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other matters </span>[2020] 5 SLR 266 (“<span class="font-italic">BAZ</span>”) at [180]. No authority was cited to support the proposition that FNC considerations engage the public policy of Singapore. They plainly do not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other arguments by the defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 2006 Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The defendants also urged me to consider Art 17I of the Model Law with amendments as adopted in 2006 (the “2006 Model Law”), which provides instances where the recognition or enforcement of an interim measure may be refused.

</div>
</div> I decline to adopt Art 17I as authoritative. It is for Parliament to amend the IAA to adopt the 2006 Model Law or Art 17I if it sees fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In any event, Art 17I of the 2006 Model Law does not assist the defendants. It does not provide for the refusal of enforcement, much less to decline the exercise of jurisdiction over an application to enforce, on FNC principles. The only possibly relevant provision is Art 17I(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), under which the court may decline enforcement if “the interim measure is incompatible with the powers conferred upon the court unless the court decides to reformulate the interim measure to the extent necessary to adapt it to its own powers and procedures for the purposes of enforcing that interim measure and without modifying its substance”. However, the <span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">ravaux </span>for the 2006 Model Law make clear that this provision is only concerned with orders that might be <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the power of the national court: see UNCITRAL Working Group on Arbitration, <span class="font-italic">Report on the work of its Thirty-Third Session</span> (A/CN.9/485, 20 December 2000) at paras 79 and 100; UNCITRAL Working Group on Arbitration, <span class="font-italic">Report on the work of its Thirty-fourth Session</span> (A/CN.9/487, 15 June 2001) at para 76; UNCITRAL Working Group on Arbitration, <span class="font-italic">Report on the work of its Thirty-eighth Session</span> (A/CN.9/524, 2 June 2003) at para 48.

</div> However, <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not apply here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune</span> did not deal with an application to enforce an interim measure, but an application to serve out an originating process. The court in <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune </span>was asked to grant a Mareva injunction in support of a foreign-seated arbitration. It did not involve a Singapore-seated arbitration, nor was jurisdiction based on submission via an exclusive or non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. In dealing with an order to serve out this application, the court correctly applied the test in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, namely that the applicant must show merits in the case and that Singapore was the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Further, it is not the case that the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test applies in all applications for service out. For example, where there is an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the contract, the “strong cause” test applies instead – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a party seeking to bring proceedings in breach of that clause must show “exceptional circumstances amounting to strong cause”: <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 814 at [83]–[85].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 An altogether different assessment applies in the context of applications for the enforcement of domestic interim measures. As noted above at [62], for such applications, there is no need to ascertain the single, most appropriate forum for enforcement. For the reasons set out above, FNC principles are irrelevant. In fact, the question of whether a case involving such an application “is a proper one for service out of Singapore” is presumptively answered in the affirmative by the fact that Singapore is the seat jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune</span> therefore does not aid the defendants’ case. Further, I note that the discussion on the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>connecting factors under the FNC analysis was ultimately irrelevant as the court in <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune</span> concluded that it did not have the power, under the IAA, to grant a Mareva injunction in aid of a foreign-seated arbitration: <span class="font-italic">Swift-Fortune </span>at [49]–[50] and [60].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For completeness, and in any case, the issue of service out of jurisdiction under O 48 r 4(2) of the ROC is <span class="font-italic">not</span> engaged in this case.

</div>
</div> These authorities do not assist them. The cases involved declaratory awards, which the courts declined to enforce either because it was outside the statutory jurisdiction of the court to enforce such an order (see <span class="font-italic">Margulies</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 207), or on the basis that enforcement served no useful purpose (see <span class="font-italic">Tridon </span>at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It suffices to note several points on <span class="font-italic">Margulies </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tridon </span>which undercut the defendants’ reliance on them. First, the Interim Order is not a declaratory award and there is therefore no question of it being incapable of enforcement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Second, they involved the application of English and Australian arbitration statutes (the Arbitration Act 1950 in <span class="font-italic">Margulies </span>and the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 in <span class="font-italic">Tridon</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>which did not incorporate the Model Law. In contrast, the enforcement provisions in the IAA and the Model Law do not differentiate between declaratory and other awards, with the result that the same limited grounds for refusal of enforcement apply to all awards. Thus, the court in <span class="font-italic">Meydan Group LLC v Banyan Tree Corporate Pte Ltd </span>[2014] DIFC CA 005 (“<span class="font-italic">Meydan</span>”) (at [25] and [33]–[34]) observed that the Model Law does not afford the court discretion to refuse a declaratory award on grounds that it would serve no useful purpose – that coram included Roger Giles J, who decided <span class="font-italic">Tridon</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Further, the apparent prohibition in <span class="font-italic">Margulies </span>against the enforcement of declaratory awards was subsequently rejected in <span class="font-italic">The Front Comor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2011] 2 All ER (Comm) 1, where the court held (at [28]) that a declaratory award will be enforced if to do so would make a positive contribution to the securing of the material benefit of the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Third, neither <span class="font-italic">Margulies </span>nor <span class="font-italic">Tridon</span> cited FNC principles as a ground for refusing to enforce an award.

It is highly unlikely that commercial parties will want to incur time and financial resources enforcing interim awards in Singapore unless there are practical benefits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appropriate for the court to hear the Leave Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Overall, I find that under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2021, this court is the appropriate court to hear the Leave Application and it should not decline to exercise its jurisdiction to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Order 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is a provision of general application, and there may well be other types of applications for which FNC principles or other considerations may dictate that it would be inappropriate for the Singapore court to hear that application. However, in the context of applications to enforce domestic interim measures under s 12(6) of the IAA, it would almost always be the case that the parties’ choice of Singapore as the seat makes the Singapore court the appropriate court to hear the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Further, it is not the case that the Interim Order has nothing to do with Singapore. Singapore law governs the tribunal’s powers to issue the Interim Order, which in turn imposes continuing obligations against all the defendants, including [CXK] which is a Singapore company. Thus, the Interim Order raises the possibility of breach by a Singapore party in Singapore. [CXK]’s officers also owe fiduciary and statutory duties under Singapore law which are relevant to the performance of the Interim Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To be clear, this is <span class="font-italic">not</span> an endorsement of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test of connecting factors as the correct method for assessing whether under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the Singapore court is an appropriate court to hear the Leave Application. As articulated, that is sufficiently dealt with by the fact that Singapore is the seat. Nevertheless, these features of the Interim Order serve to bolster the conclusion that it is appropriate for this court to hear the Leave Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Committal proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The defendants argued that they would be prejudiced by the hearing of the Leave Application by this court as the mechanism for enforcement of the Interim Order would likely be committal proceedings brought against its officers for breach.

</div> This was in fact one of the main planks of their submission that Singapore was not the appropriate forum under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2021. Since compliance with the terms of the Interim Order requires steps to be taken in Malaysia, they argued that they may have difficulty producing evidence, particularly from third parties in Malaysia, to demonstrate what steps have been taken to comply with the same.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendants have conflated enforcement of the Interim Order with the execution of a committal order. If the court grants permission to enforce the Interim Order, and assuming there is a breach of the Interim Order, the aggrieved party must first apply to the court for permission to make an application for a committal order: see O 23 r 3(1) of the ROC 2021. The court may at that stage consider the nature of the application and decide whether to grant such permission. The considerations which the defendants have pointed to are more relevant to that stage of proceedings – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether a committal order should be granted, rather than the present stage of proceedings – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether enforcement of the Interim Order should be granted. Further, at the present stage, the prospect and nature of any potential committal proceedings are uncertain. Indeed, what evidence will be relevant in a future committal proceeding (if any), and whether there will be any difficulty adducing that evidence, will depend on the breach alleged. That has not arisen. Thus, it would be speculative at this point to decide on the propriety of a committal order, which was essentially what the defendants were asking this court to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Further, whether committal proceedings will even be brought is also speculative. The defendants say they have complied with the Interim Order, save for the Renaming Commitment, which is subject to the approval or acts of third parties in Malaysia. The claimants have also not alleged that the defendants are in breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In fact, the difficulties with pursuing committal proceedings, if any, will be on <span class="font-italic">the claimants</span>. They will have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendants are in deliberate breach of the terms of the Interim Order: <span class="font-italic">Monex Group (Singapore) Pte Ltd v E-Clearing (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1169 at [30]. The defendants will be able to give evidence of what steps they have taken, what difficulties they have encountered and why they have done all that is reasonable for them to do. If the evidence of non-compliance is in Malaysia and cannot be adduced, it will be more difficult for the claimants to satisfy their burden of proof. Further, and again to the claimant’s disadvantage, if the defendants’ officers responsible for the breach are outside this court’s jurisdiction, then any committal proceedings brought will likely be ineffective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In any event, the difficulties cited by the defendants would similarly exist in respect of committal proceedings arising from foreign awards or interim measures, but, as discussed above at [72], that is not a ground to oppose their enforcement. Thus, the defendants’ concerns relating to committal proceedings are not relevant in determining the appropriate court under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), whether as part of their FNC arguments or as a standalone factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The defendants relied on <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports Co Ltd and another v GMR Mal</span><span class="font-italic">é International Airport Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span>”) for the proposition that the court will generally not make an order that it cannot properly supervise.

</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span>, the Court of Appeal was addressing an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge below to grant an interim injunction (“the Injunction”) in aid of a Singapore-seated international arbitration. The Court of Appeal (at [2]) allowed the appeal, holding that the balance of convenience did not lie in favour of the Injunction being granted or upheld. A significant factor leading to this conclusion was the presence of practical problems associated with the enforcement of the Injunction, including an unacceptable degree of supervision in a foreign land: <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports </span>at [71].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports </span>dealt with the <span class="font-italic">merits</span> of granting an injunction. It was in that context that the court considered whether the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting the Injunction. However, the issue before me was a <span class="font-italic">jurisdictional </span>one – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction to hear the Leave Application. The balance of convenience considerations do not apply since the court is simply concerned with whether the application should even be heard at all. In fact, the court in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span> did consider at length, prior to its assessment of the balance of convenience, whether it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal: see <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports </span>at [14]–[31]. It found that it did, and no balance of convenience considerations featured in that analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In any case, the enforcement of the Interim Injunction does bear some connecting factors to Singapore: see [95] above. Hence, an order granting enforcement of the Interim Injunction will not be an exercise in futility, unlike the case in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span>. Further, a balance of convenience test is a multifactorial and fact-centric exercise. Besides the factor of an unacceptable degree of supervision in a foreign land, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports</span> cited many other factors in reaching its decision that the balance of convenience lay in favour of not granting the Injunction. These included the fact that there was an adequate remedy in damages should the Injunction not be granted (at [65]); the sheer width of the Injunction sought, which led to uncertainty in compliance (at [68]); and the impact which the Injunction would have on third parties (at [69]). It would be incorrect to reduce that analysis to a single factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Finally, and in any case, the fact that the court order <span class="font-italic">may</span> not be enforced effectively is not a sufficient reason for the court to decline to hear enforcement proceedings for, or to grant the enforcement of, an interim measure. An example would be an anti-suit injunction issued by the court against a foreign party commencing, or proceeding with, foreign proceedings in breach of an arbitration agreement. The court of the seat will ordinarily grant such remedy: see <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 732 at [68]. Whether the respondent will comply, and whether compliance with the injunction can be effectively enforced, is a separate matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 If the defendants have genuine, practical difficulties in complying with the terms of the Interim Order, which terms I note were volunteered by [MBX], it is open to them to apply to the Tribunal for a variation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For completeness, and for the same reasons above, I reject the defendants’ alternative arguments that the Leave Application be stayed under s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) (read with para 9 of the First Schedule) and the inherent jurisdiction of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Possible limitations to the court’s discretion under s 12(6) of the IAA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The court’s exercise of its discretion to grant permission to enforce under s 12(6) of the IAA was not before me. It is to be addressed at the merits hearing for the Leave Application. However, given the dearth of both statutory and judicial guidance on this issue, I make some brief observations on the issue. For clarity, the possible limitations on the court’s exercise of discretion under s 12(6) of the IAA discussed below are <span class="font-italic">not </span>jurisdictional factors to be considered under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2021. Rather, they are arguments for resisting enforcement of domestic interim measures under s 12(6) of the IAA and O 48 of the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Given Parliament’s exclusion of the s 12(6) regime from the setting aside and refusal of enforcement mechanisms under the IAA (see [44] and [73] above), the bar for the court to refuse to grant permission to enforce a domestic interim measure must necessarily be a high one. In my view, if there are any limits to the court’s discretion to grant permission to enforce a domestic interim measure, they are where:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the granting of the interim measure would have been in excess of the court’s powers;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the enforcement of the interim measure would be against public policy; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the enforcement application is brought in abuse of process, which the court always has the inherent power to control.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Excess of the court’s powers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Logically, the court cannot grant permission to enforce an interim measure which it could not itself have granted. Hence, where the granting of the interim measure would have been in excess of the court’s powers, the court must refuse permission to enforce it. An example is where the interim measure calls for the exercise of police powers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Public policy is included as a ground for setting aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law and refusal of enforcement of awards under s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. I note the court’s observation in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT </span>[2011] 4 SLR 739 at [37] that there is no difference between the setting aside and the enforcement regime where the ground of public policy is concerned. Thus, the case law on public policy in the enforcement regime is likewise relevant to the setting aside regime: <span class="font-italic">AJU </span>at [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In my view, the public policy ground and that same body of case law are also applicable to the enforcement of domestic interim measures. The <span class="font-italic">travaux</span> for the Model Law makes clear that the public policy ground is concerned with “fundamental notions and principles of justice”, rather than state politics or policies. As the court in <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi</span>”) observed at [59]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As was highlighted in the Commission Report (A/40/17), at para 297 (referred to in A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary by Howard M Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus (Kluwer, 1989) at p 914):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In discussing the term “public policy”, it was understood that it was not equivalent to the political stance or international policies of a State but comprised <span class="font-italic">the fundamental notions and principles of justice</span>… It was understood that the term “public policy”, which was used in the 1958 New York Convention and many other treaties, covered fundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well as procedural respects. Thus, instances such as corruption, bribery or fraud and similar serious cases would constitute a ground for setting aside.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I see no reason why such contravention of “fundamental notions and principles of justice”, and the body of case law outlining its ambit, should not also feature in the court’s exercise of its discretion to permit the enforcement of domestic interim measures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In this regard, the prevailing approach is that the public policy objection must involve either “exceptional circumstances … which would justify the court in refusing to enforce the award”, or be a violation of “the most basic notions of morality and justice: <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts </span>at [162], citing <span class="font-italic">AJU </span>at [38]. Similarly, the court in <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi </span>noted at [59] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under the [IAA] <span class="font-italic">encompasses a narrow scope</span> … it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would ‘<span class="font-italic">shock the conscience</span>’ … or is ‘<span class="font-italic">clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public</span>’ … or where it <span class="font-italic">violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In <span class="font-italic">CEB v CEC and another matter </span>[2020] 4 SLR 183 at [50], the Court of Appeal commented on this holding in <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi</span>, noting that “[t]hese are strong words which give effect to the underlying objective that it is only in circumstances where the effect of an award comes into conflict with accepted norms of public decency, behaviour, morality and/or justice that the court should intervene”. The court in <span class="font-italic">CEB </span>noted further that “[t]his will seldom be the case in commercial disputes”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 An example of when the enforcement of an award would be contrary to public policy would be where the enforcement of the award would mean ignoring the underlying contract’s “palpable and indisputable illegality”: <span class="font-italic">Westacre Investments Inc v Jugoimport-SPDR Holding Co Ltd </span>[1999] QB 740 at 767 (cited in <span class="font-italic">CBX and another v CBZ and others </span>[2020] 5 SLR 184 at [56]). Another (more specific) example may be found in <span class="font-italic">BAZ</span>. There, the court held (at [180]) that “it violates Singapore’s most basic notion of justice” to find minors liable under a contract that was entered into when they were only between three to eight years old. Thus, the court set aside the arbitral award as it related to the minors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The court’s inherent power to regulate its own process in order to prevent it from being misused is well-established: see <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]–[32]. This power should apply where the enforcement of domestic interim measures is sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I note that it is difficult to map the conventional understanding of an abuse of process onto the enforcement of domestic interim measures. The court in <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) explained (at [22]) that the term “abuse of process” signifies that the process of the court must be used <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and properly and must not be abused – in this regard, the court would prevent the improper use of its machinery and prevent the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. A type of conduct which constituted an abuse of process was the bringing of an action for a collateral purpose: <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter </span>at [22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 However, in the context of applications to enforce a domestic interim measure, it is difficult to see how such an application could be used “as a means of vexation and oppression” or “for a collateral purpose”. A tribunal has necessarily determined that it is appropriate on the merits to order the domestic interim measure in favour of the applicant. The statutory regime under s 12(6) of the IAA is specifically intended to aid and facilitate the enforcement of that domestic interim measure. Indeed, given the legitimate reasons to seek enforcement in the court of the seat (see [67]–[68] above), it will be extremely difficult to establish that such an application is an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In any case, there is no need in the present case to explore if enforcement of the Interim Order would be an abuse of process. The affidavits filed by the defendants did not allege that the Leave Application was an abuse of process. As stated above at [13], it was not even the defendant’s case that this court had no jurisdiction over the Leave Application – the defendants accepted that it did. The defendant’s affidavits focused entirely on why Malaysia was the more appropriate forum – there was no allegation of a collateral purpose or vexatious motive underlying the Leave Application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In the context of the enforcement of domestic interim measures, FNC considerations do not apply in determining whether this court is the appropriate court to hear the Leave Applications under O 6 r 12(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC 2021. In any event, I have determined that it is appropriate for this court to hear the Leave Application.
