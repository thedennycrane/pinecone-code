        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Applicant seeks judicial review of the
                    decision of the Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”) to appoint a
                    second disciplinary committee (“2nd DC”) to hear and
                    investigate a complaint following the recusal of the entire disciplinary
                    committee (“1st DC”) originally appointed to hear and
                    investigate the same complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The judicial remedies sought by the Applicant
                    are that of a Quashing Order against the SMC’s decision to appoint the
                    2nd DC to hear and investigate the complaint and a Prohibiting Order
                    against the SMC taking any steps to bring disciplinary proceedings against the
                    Applicant on the same subject matter covered in the charges set out in the
                    Notice of Inquiry by the 1st DC dated 20 July 2009. Finally, the
                    Applicant seeks a Declaration that the Medical Registration (Amendment)
                    Regulations 2010 (S 528/2010) (“the S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations”) are void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary Observations</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i) Professional medical ethics and the market</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At this hearing, many important issues relating
                    to the private sector medical profession were raised. Public and private sector
                    medical services are provided through a variety of forms and practice models.
                    Whilst the traditional paradigm has been the solo general practitioner, the
                    provision of private medical services today reflects a variety of practice
                    models. These private sector models include group general practices, stand-alone
                    specialist consultancies and consultancies operating with private hospitals and
                    non-medical service providers. Whatever the forms and practice models, is the
                    private medical sector a free market, subject only to contract, or is it
                    concurrently subject to an underlying bedrock of medical professional ethical
                    standards? What are these ethical standards and how do they impact a
                    one-stop-shop practice model, which provides medical and non-medical services,
                    directly and indirectly, through outsourced third party service providers? Are
                    the SMC’s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines an exhaustive statement of
                    all operative medical ethical standards or are there, concurrently applicable
                    underlying ethical principles and norms as well?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As important as these issues may be, these are
                    not, however, issues properly to be determined by the court. Parliament has
                    under s 5(f) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174 2004 Rev Ed)
                    (“MRA”) placed the duty “to determine and regulate the
                    conduct and ethics” of medical practitioners on the SMC. Parliament has
                    prescribed a statutory process of professional ethical standards and
                    disciplinary accountability for medical practitioners. The <em>raison d’etre</em> for such a regulatory approach is explained
                    by a variety of factors including the total dependence and trust in life and
                    death decisions, which a patient is obliged to repose in his physician. Other
                    factors include the following (see Margaret Stacey, <em>Regulating British Medicine: The General Medical Council</em> (John
                    Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992) at p 246):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The particular nature of the doctor-patient relationship, its
                        intimacy and the associated potential for exploitation is one reason; the
                        irremediable and serious nature of mistakes that can be made is another.
                        ‘Buyer beware’ is little help to the irreparably damaged or dead
                        person–the ultimate risk of falling into the wrong hands in the
                        medical market. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Because of the complex and special nature of
                    medical services, Parliament has placed the responsibility upon the medical
                    profession itself (not the courts and not other agencies including the Ministry
                    of Health, Singapore (“MOHS”)) to establish the appropriate
                    standards of conduct and ethics and to investigate, find and sanction breaches.
                    The sanctions for breaches range from censure, restrictions, suspension, fines
                    and the loss of a licence to practice. Because such sanctions may seriously
                    affect the career and reputation of the medical practitioner, an elaborate
                    structure of procedural safeguards has been inscribed in the MRA to strike a
                    balance between the public interest and the protection of the medical
                    practitioner. I note the principles in <em>Christine Woods v The
                        General Medical Council</em> [2002] EWHC 1484 <em>per</em> Burton J at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principles which underline these provisions [<em>ie</em>, the General Medical Council Preliminary
                        Proceedings Committee and Professional Conduct Committee (Procedure) Rules
                        1988] have been explained (by reference to the pre-August 2000 Rules) in the
                        three cases to which I have referred and can be summarised as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) They constitute a fine balance between three competing
                            desirables:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The protection of the public from the risk of
                                practice by practitioners who for any reason (whether competence,
                                integrity or health) are incompetent or unfit to practice, and the
                                maintenance of standards.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The maintenance of the reputation of, and
                                public confidence in, the medical profession, and the legitimate
                                expectation of the public, and of complainants in particular, that
                                complaints of serious professional misconduct will be fully and
                                fairly investigated.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The need for legitimate safeguards for the
                                practitioner, who as a professional person may be considered
                                particularly vulnerable to, and damaged by, unwarranted charges
                                against him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short, Parliament has provided in the MRA that the SMC is to set
                    the ethical standards. Parliament has also provided that the investigation,
                    findings and sanctions for breaches of these standards are to be made, not by
                    the SMC, but by the relevant complaints committees and the disciplinary
                    committees to be appointed by the Chairman of the Complaints Panel and the SMC
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii) The nature of judicial review court proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It should be noted that these proceedings in
                    court are not proceedings in the nature of an appeal to court. The key
                    differences between an appeal and judicial review bear restating. It is worth
                    noting the following observation by Andrew Ang J in <em>ACC
                        v CIT</em>[2010] 1 SLR 273 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well established that in judicial review, the court is concerned not
                        with the merits of the decision but the process by which the decision has
                        been made. ... This is because judicial review is not an appeal from a
                        decision and the court cannot substitute its discretion for that of the
                        public body nor can it quash a decision on the basis that the court would
                        not have arrived at that decision or that some other decision would have
                        been a better one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The merits of the SMC’s decision, as indeed the merits of the
                    decisions of the disciplinary committees, are not within the remit of the court,
                    save to the limited extent of appeals to a court of three judges provided by
                    s 46(7) of the MRA. In this judicial review hearing, the court will review
                    and determine only the legality of the process leading to the SMC’s
                    decision to refer the complaint to the 2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The second caveat about judicial review
                    proceedings is that they succeed or fail entirely on the record. In other words,
                    whether the legal grounds have been made out in court will be determined
                    entirely on the record. No evidence apart from the record is adduced in court
                    save as a court may exceptionally permit in an appropriate case. The Applicant
                    in the middle of the hearing sought leave pursuant to O 53 r 3 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to introduce five
                    affidavits from independent doctors who wished to clarify their roles which had
                    been referred to by the Respondent in court and extensively covered in the
                    media. These affidavits have no relevance to this judicial review proceeding and
                    I do not grant leave. For the purposes of this judicial review proceeding, the
                    record comprises the statement filed by the Applicant in support of these
                    applications, the Respondent’s affidavit in reply to that statement,
                    affidavits filed by the Applicant in response, and all annexures
                thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii) The version of the MRA applicable to these
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A final preliminary point should be noted. The
                    MRA relevant to these proceedings excludes, for the most part, the amendments
                    made under the Medical Registration (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act No 1 of 2010)
                    (“the Amendment Act”) in which amendments to the MRA were brought
                    into effect on 10 August 2010 and 1 December 2010 (see s 41(3) of
                    the Amendment Act and the relevant gazette notifications). Save as otherwise
                    expressly stated, all references in this judgment to the MRA refers to the
                    relevant version of the MRA excluding these amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Chronology of Events</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Complaint of 3 December 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dato Serbini Ali, the Permanent Secretary of the
                    Ministry of Health, Brunei (“MOHB”) wrote to Ms Yong Ying-I,
                    the Permanent Secretary of the MOHS on 27 August 2007 expressing concerns
                    relating to the Applicant’s invoices for the treatment of a Brunei patient
                    (“the Patient”) as being “unacceptable and extremely
                    high” and seeking MOHS’s intervention. In October 2007, searches
                    were conducted under s 12 of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act
                    (Cap 248, 1999 Rev Ed) at the Applicant’s private clinics. The
                    Applicant was required to produce papers and records relating first to the
                    Patient and later for other patients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 3 December 2007, Dr Tan Chor
                    Hiang, who signed off as the “Senior Director (Health Regulation
                    Division), for Permanent Secretary, (Health)” filed a complaint against
                    the Applicant (“the Complaint”). The Complaint recounted that MOHS
                    had conducted an investigation after reviewing the information set out in the
                    two letters enclosed with the MOHB’s letter and had become
                    “concerned that [the Applicant] may have taken unfair advantage of her
                    position as the principal physician to the Patient, and of the trust and
                    confidence which had been reposed in her” and that “[o]vercharging
                    on such a magnitude could also bring disrepute to the medical professional in
                    Singapore.” Noting that what it had presented in the Complaint was
                    necessarily based on a preliminary review of the documents it had obtained and
                    seen, MOHS identified the following instances which raised its concerns as to
                    the propriety of the Applicant’s services and practices:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the invoices issued showed a pattern of
                            overcharging and/or improper billing;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether some charges were inappropriate charges
                            for professional services which the Applicant did not render or which
                            were carried out with the assistance of other doctors;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether there were conflicts of interest relating
                            to invoices issued by several clinics, all of which the Applicant
                            managed.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The Complaint concluded that the MOHS was referring the matter to the
                    SMC “for a thorough investigation as to whether [the Applicant’s]
                    general conduct in relation to the Patient amounts to professional
                    misconduct”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Complaints Committee Order of 17 November 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Complaints Committee on 18 December
                    2007 invited the Applicant to provide a written explanation, which she did by a
                    letter of 4 February 2008. The Applicant was informed by a letter of
                    17 November 2008 that the Complaints Committee, having carefully reviewed
                    the circumstances of the Complaint and the information submitted, had ordered
                    that a formal inquiry be held by a disciplinary committee.</p>

                    20 July 2009. The 1st DC commenced its hearing and resumed on
                    29 July 2010 for a three day hearing on the Applicant’s submission of
                    no case to answer. The selected relevant extracts from the transcript (not in
                    immediate sequence) discloses the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman: On behalf of the DC, I would like to thank both counsels very
                        much for the well-written and thorough submissions on no case to answer. We
                        have read the written submissions and I understand from my colleagues and
                        the panel that we have no further questions to raise. Does either party have
                        anything else to add or submit before we deliver our decision at this
                        stage?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Applicant’s counsel: ... Mr Chairman, I have taken instructions and
                        I have reviewed the transcript with my client. On the basis of all that is
                        on the record, we do not consider it would be appropriate for this tribunal
                        to continue, and I’m therefore applying to yourselves to recuse
                        yourselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Respondent’s counsel: ... I would like to confirm that the
                        prosecution’s position is that we are not objecting to the
                        respondent’s application for this tribunal to recuse itself; I do want
                        to explain that, while we don’t ourselves consider that the tribunal
                        has behaved in any way improperly or in any objectionable manner, and we are
                        reassured by the assurance that the tribunal will keep an open mind up to
                        the time of hearing all submissions, oral and written. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman: Thank you for waiting. After some discussion, I think the DC is
                        inclined to recuse itself since the prosecution has no objection to the
                        respondent’s application. ….</p>

                appointment of the 1st DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 September 2010, Ms Serene Wong,
                    the Senior Manager, Professional Conduct and Professional Standards Division,
                    SMC, sent an email to all SMC members, the material terms of which read as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    At the hearing on
                            29 Jul 2010, the Defence Counsel made a procedural application for
                            the Disciplinary Committee (DC) to recuse itself. Details of this case
                            can be given only at the conclusion of the inquiry and until then, we
                            seek your kind understanding and patience of this

                            Council to revoke the appointment of the current DC hearing this inquiry
                            and <em>appoint a new DC pursuant to Section 42(5)
                                of the Medical Registration Act</em>, i.e.,:</p>

                    objection to the revocation on 16 September 2010, sometime after the return

<b>Singapore
                        Law on Judicial Review</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The law relating to judicial review of
                    administrative decisions is expressed in two overarching core common law
                    principles. First, no legal power is beyond the reach of the supervisory
                    jurisdiction of the court if it is exercised beyond its legal limits (<em>ie</em>, illegality / <em>ultra
                        vires</em> the enabling law, bad faith or if the exercise of the power
                    is <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational (see <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury
                        Corporation</em> [1948] 1 KB 223)). Second, the procedural
                    fairness / natural justice rule which comprises: (a) the <em>nemo
                        iudex in sua causa</em> rule / the rule that no one shall be a judge
                    in his own cause, which is the rule against bias; and (b) the <em>audi alteram partem</em> rule / the “hear the other
                    side” rule, which is the fair hearing rule (see <em>Yong
                        Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011] SGCA 9 at [88]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By way of parenthesis I should add that,
                    whilst Singapore law on judicial review has English common law foundations, the
                    more recent English cases and treatises are of little relevance where they
                    embody or have been shaped by European Union treaty and legislative obligations
                    which have no application to Singapore. For this reason, it is not unusual to
                    find Singapore courts referring to the 1973
                    3rd<sup> </sup>edition of <em>De
                        Smith’s Judicial Review</em> rather than the most recent 2007
                    6th edition of the same work. There does not currently exist a definitive
                    modern text on Singapore administrative law, in the absence of which I have
                    found some assistance in delineating the contours and boundaries of Singapore
                    administrative law from a soon to be published paper delivered by
                    Professor Thio Li-ann at the recent Singapore Academy of Law conference on
                    developments in Singapore law from 2006 to 2010: Thio Li-ann<em>, The Theory and Practice of Judicial Review of Administrative
                        Action in Singapore: Trends and Perspectives</em> (2011)

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Legal Grounds for Judicial Review </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I next proceed to examine the particular legal
                    grounds on which these applications have been launched:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Quashing Order application to quash the
                            SMC’s decision to appoint the 2nd DC on the grounds of:
                            (i) illegality under the MRA; and (ii) actual or apprehension of
                            bias on the part of the SMC.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Prohibiting Order to prohibit the SMC from

                            complaint against the Applicant is made on the ground of <em>Wednesbury</em> irrationality and on considerations
                            of “unfairness, prejudice and oppression”.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Declaration application for the
                            S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations to be declared void is made on the
                            ground that the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations in their entirety
                            are contrary to natural justice.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Applicant is not seeking to quash the
                    1st DC’s hearing or its recusal. Neither is the Applicant seeking to
                    quash the hearing of the 2nd DC which has commenced but has not proceeded
                    further because of these court applications. In passing, it should be noted that
                    the Applicant’s legal rights to seek judicial review of the findings and
                    decision of the 2nd DC are preserved and remain unaffected by these court
                    applications. In short, what is unusual in these court applications is that no
                    challenge is being mounted against any finding or decision of any disciplinary
                    committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     What is novel here is that, instead, the
                    challenge is mounted against the SMC’s decision to refer the Complaint to
                    the 2nd DC following the recusal of the 1st DC. What accounts for this
                    approach?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Applicant has chosen to attack the SMC
                    which is placed at the critical junction of the MRA’s disciplinary
                    process. Under the MRA, generally no complaint may move without a prior SMC
                    decision to refer it to the Chairman of the Complaints Panel who appoints the
                    complaints committee to inquire into the complaint or, where a complaints
                    committee has ordered a formal inquiry, to a disciplinary committee to hear and
                    investigate the complaint. However, a quashing of the SMC’s decision to
                    appoint the 2nd DC would not be sufficient to end the matter. The Quashing
                    Order does not operate as a bar to a fresh SMC decision being taken on the same
                    matter. Such a fresh SMC decision, if made without any legally defective
                    processes, will stand in law. However, if the SMC decision could be quashed
                        <em>and prohibited</em>, this would achieve the result
                    that no future complaints committees or disciplinary committees may be appointed
                    to inquire into the same Complaint against the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Applicant thus seeks both a Quashing Order
                    against the SMC’s decision to refer the Complaint to the 2nd DC on
                    grounds of illegality and bias, coupled with a Prohibiting Order against the SMC
                    proceeding to appoint any further disciplinary committee on the ground of
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> irrationality and
                    “unfairness, prejudice and oppression”
                considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Applicant’s case will thus depend
                    entirely on whether the relevant legal grounds upon which these judicial review
                    remedies against the SMC are contingent, are established on the
                record.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is judicial review limited to exercises of discretion only or also to
                administrative decisions?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There was a preliminary question as to whether
                    judicial review is available only with respect to the exercise of discretion but
                    not with respect to decisions which carry no discretion. The Respondent
                    submitted that the SMC’s decision, whether under s 41(3) or
                    s 42(5) of the MRA, being decisions in which the SMC did not have any
                    discretion, were not susceptible to judicial review. This submission I find to
                    be flawed for the reasons that follow. In the first place, if hypothetically,
                    the SMC were to decide in any case not to refer a complaint to the Chairman of
                    the Complaints Panel, the SMC could find itself being subject to a mandatory
                    order (which is a judicial review remedy) application for it to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The courts in judicial review will subject
                    administrative decisions to the legality tests as well as the duty to act
                    fairly. With respect to the duty to act fairly, Lord Bridge of Harwich
                    stated in <em>Lloyd and others v McMahon</em> [1987]
                    AC 625 at 702–703:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, the so-called rules of natural justice are not engraved on
                        tablets of stone. To use the phrase which better expresses the underlying
                        concept, what the requirements of fairness demand when any body, domestic,
                        administrative or judicial, has to make a decision which will affect the
                        rights of individuals depends on the character of the decision-making body,
                        the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework in
                        which it operates. In particular, it is well established that when a statute
                        has conferred on any body the power to make decisions affecting individuals,
                        the court will not only require the procedure prescribed by the statute to
                        be followed, but will readily imply so much and no more to be introduced by
                        way of additional procedural safeguards as will ensure the attainment of
                        fairness. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     What is clear from the foregoing is that
                    administrative decisions are susceptible to judicial review for legality and for
                    fairness, whether or not they involve a discretion. With respect to fairness,
                    the content of the duty to act fairly will vary depending on the nature and
                    statutory context of the relevant decision. Where the relevant statute
                    prescribes a hearing, the duty to act fairly will encompass the whole gamut of
                    natural justice prescriptions. Where the relevant statute prescribes a narrow
                    decision to be made, the duty to act fairly carries a narrower
                scope.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This is well set out in para 10.049 of
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, vol 1
                    (LexisNexis, 2009 Reissue) which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A general duty to act fairly applies to almost all decision-making in the
                        field of public law, but its content varies from those cases where all the
                        traditional rules of natural justice apply to those where fairness requires
                        very little of the decision-maker. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a discretionary power to encroach upon individual rights is
                        exercised, factors to be taken into account in deciding what fairness
                        requires in exercise of the power, include the nature of the interests
                        affected, the circumstances in which the power falls for exercise and the
                        nature of the sanctions, if any, involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Quashing Order Application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality Ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Applicant first challenges the SMC’s
                    appointment of the 2nd DC as being illegal under the MRA on the ground that
                    the SMC may only appoint a disciplinary committee immediately after the
                    Complaints Committee had made its order for a formal inquiry under s 41(3)
                    of the MRA. The SMC’s decision to appoint the 2nd DC on
                    14 September 2010 in the light of the Complaints Committee order of
                    17 November 2008, the Applicant submits, could not be said to have been
                    done immediately. The second string in the Applicant’s case of illegality
                    is that if the SMC had appointed the 2nd DC under s 42(5) of the MRA,
                    the word “may” in s 42(5) MRA conferred a discretion on the
                    SMC. The SMC, by taking the position that it had no discretion in appointing the
                    2nd DC, had thereby unlawfully fettered its statutory discretion. It is
                    well established that an administrative agency must not fetter its discretion:
                    see <em>Registrar of Vehicles v Komoco Motors Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 340 at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principle that an administrative agency <em>must not fetter its own power</em> or abrogate it to another
                        administrative agency <em>is unexceptional</em> as a
                        violation of this principle <em>would amount to a failure by
                            the former to exercise the power vested in it</em>.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I should first set out these provisions.
                    Section 41(3) of the MRA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a Complaints Committee has made an order for a formal inquiry to be
                        held by a Disciplinary Committee, the Medical Council shall immediately
                        appoint a Disciplinary Committee which shall hear and investigate the
                        complaint or matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 42(5) of the MRA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Medical Council may at any time revoke the appointment of any
                        Disciplinary Committee or may remove any member of the Disciplinary
                        Committee or fill any vacancy in a Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Section 41(3) of the MRA provides that
                    the SMC shall appoint a disciplinary committee where a complaints committee has
                    made an order for a formal inquiry. As the statute is unambiguous, the SMC is
                    then obliged to refer such complaints to a disciplinary committee which shall
                    hear and investigate the complaint. Where the SMC has referred a complaint to
                    the Chairman of the Complaints Panel and a complaints committee is of the view
                    that a formal inquiry is not necessary, the complaints committee has to decide
                    whether to dismiss the complaint, issue a letter of advice or warning, or make
                    such other order. Where the complaints committee has ordered a formal inquiry,
                    the SMC is obliged under s 41(3) of the MRA to immediately appoint a
                    disciplinary committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Turning to s 42(5) of the MRA,
                    s 42(5) of the MRA, as a matter of plain construction, contemplates the
                    revocation of the appointment of the entire disciplinary committee, the removal
                    of any member(s) thereof, as well as the filling of any vacancy(s). The plain
                    meaning of “vacancy” in this context is that of “the fact
                    or condition of an office or post being, becoming, or falling vacant [or] an
                    occasion or occurrence of this” (see J A Simpson and
                    E S C Weiner, <em>The Oxford English
                        Dictionary</em> (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989)). A vacancy in a
                    disciplinary committee may arise from any number of reasons including death,
                    disability, resignation, recusal or removal of its members. In any of these
                    instances, the SMC is statutorily empowered by s 42(5) of the MRA to fill
                    any vacancy(s).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     When however the SMC revokes the appointment
                    of an entire disciplinary committee, it cannot be said that the SMC had removed
                        <em>each</em> one of its members. Neither can the SMC
                    in revoking the appointment of the entire 1st DC be regarded thereby to
                    have created four vacancies which it may thereafter fill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Once the SMC revokes the appointment of the
                    entire disciplinary committee, there no longer exists a disciplinary committee
                    for which any vacancy remains to be filled. The SMC will after such revocation
                    have to locate a statutory power, quite apart from s 42(5) of the MRA, to
                    appoint another disciplinary committee to inquire into the same complaint. It
                    would however palpably be unlawful for the SMC to appoint a new disciplinary
                    committee to conduct a formal inquiry on the same complaint were it to revoke
                    the appointment of a disciplinary committee after it had issued its findings and
                    decision. <em>Autrefois convict</em> (one who has been
                    convicted cannot be prosecuted again for the same offence) and <em>autrefois acquit</em> (no man is to be brought into jeopardy
                    more than once for the same offence), are legal principles applicable to
                    disciplinary proceedings (see <em>Wee Harry Lee v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 768 at [23] and <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Nathan Edmund</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 905 at [11]). Short of this, and barring any other
                    legal obstacles, the SMC remains empowered to appoint disciplinary committees
                    provided the conditions of s 41(3) of the MRA (being the only relevant
                    statutory provision empowering the SMC to appoint a disciplinary committee) are
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Having determined the language and meaning of
                    the relevant MRA provisions, I next turn to consider what the SMC did on the
                    facts of this case. The record reveals the following facts: (a) the 1st DC
                    recused itself on 29 July 2010; (b) the SMC revoked the appointment of the
                    entire 1st DC on 7 September 2010; and (c) the SMC appointed the
                    2nd DC to hear the Complaint on 14 September 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The substance of what exactly the SMC decided
                    on two separate occasions first with respect to the revocation of the
                    1st DC and thereafter to the appointment of the 2nd DC are to be found
                    in two separate emails, in particular paras 3 and 4 of the email of
                    3 September 2010 to SMC members (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) and paras 1 and 2 of the second email of
                    13 September 2010 (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The 7 September 2010 SMC decision was
                    expressed in the terms of the 3 September 2010 email which discloses that
                    the SMC, in substance, decided to revoke the appointment of the entire
                    1st DC. Further, the 14 September 2010 SMC decision was expressed in
                    the terms of the 13 September 2007 email which discloses that the SMC
                    decided to appoint the 2nd DC to hear and investigate the
                Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The emphasised words in para 3 of the
                    3 September 2010 email to SMC members (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) are erroneous insofar as they suggest that the
                    subsequent appointment of a new disciplinary committee would be pursuant to
                    s 42(5) of the MRA. Nothing however turns on this error as the SMC did not
                    decide to appoint the 2nd DC in the terms of the 3 September 2010
                    email. The SMC’s decision to appoint the 2nd DC was made on the quite
                    separate 13 September 2010 email. Whilst this second email is silent on the
                    statutory basis of the appointment of the 2nd DC, this appointment must
                    necessarily be founded on s 41(3) of the MRA which is the only relevant
                    provision in the MRA which confers a power on the SMC to appoint disciplinary
                    committees to hear and investigate complaints. Having so concluded, it is not
                    necessary for me to deal with the Applicant’s second string argument that
                    s 42(5) of the MRA grants the SMC a discretion which it had unlawfully
                    fettered by having taken the position that it had no discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I turn next to considering the question of
                    s 41(3) of the MRA requiring an immediate appointment. I should begin by
                    considering when exactly the decision to appoint a disciplinary committee arose
                    in this case. The Complaints Committee ordered a formal inquiry by a
                    disciplinary committee on 17 November 2008. The 1st DC commenced its
                    hearing on 28 January 2010 and recused itself on 20 July 2010. No
                    objection has been made in court that the appointment of the 1st DC in 2009
                    was not in compliance with s 41(3). The 2nd DC was appointed on
                    14 September 2010. It is clear that, whilst the 2nd DC is termed as
                    the “2nd” in this judgment for ease of reference, this is a
                    2nd DC only in chronology and not to suggest that it was hearing and
                    investigating the same complaint on which any earlier disciplinary committee had
                    issued its findings and decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The disciplinary structure in the MRA
                    contemplates that every formal inquiry ordered by a complaints committee be
                    heard by a disciplinary committee which concludes the process by issuing the
                    disciplinary committee’s findings and decision. Until the issue of a
                    disciplinary committee’s findings and decision, the Complaints Committee
                    order still stands on the record and remains unspent. Since the 1st DC had
                    not issued any findings and decision within the meaning of s 45 of the MRA,
                    the power to appoint a disciplinary committee under s 41(3) is not
                    spent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having in mind this statutory structure and
                    its purposes, how the court regards the significance of the prescribed timing of
                    the appointment of any disciplinary committee within the context of s 41(3)
                    of the MRA falls to be determined on the facts in each case. There are three
                    possible scenarios. Firstly, a disciplinary committee may ordinarily be
                    appointed by the SMC either after a complaints committee has issued its order
                    for a formal inquiry or directly pursuant to s 39(3) of the MRA. Secondly,
                    as has occurred here, where the SMC has revoked the appointment of an entire
                    disciplinary committee prior to it issuing any findings or decision, it may
                    appoint another disciplinary committee to hear and investigate the complaint, as
                    its power to appoint a disciplinary committee has not been spent. In such a
                    scenario, time must necessarily run from the SMC’s decision to revoke the
                    entire disciplinary committee’s appointment. This is because the SMC would
                    have no power to appoint any disciplinary committee to hear and investigate into
                    a complaint whilst there is subsisting a disciplinary committee hearing and
                    investigating the same complaint. There remains a third scenario. Where an
                    entire disciplinary committee has recused itself prior to issuing its findings
                    and decision, the SMC could proceed to appoint a fresh disciplinary committee to
                    hear and investigate the same complaint without any prior need to revoke the
                    appointment of the entire recused disciplinary committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Given that the SMC had the statutory power
                    under s 42(5) of the MRA to revoke the appointment of the 1st DC, and
                    my conclusion that it thereupon continued to have the power to appoint the
                    2nd DC, it would follow that the relevant time frames for consideration
                    would be 7 September 2010 (the date of the SMC’s revocation decision)
                    and 14 September 2010 (the date of the SMC’s decision to appoint the
                    2nd DC). In the light of this, the duration taken to appoint the
                    2nd DC is incontrovertibly in compliance with s 41(3) of the MRA. Even
                    if consideration needs to be given to the earlier date of recusal as the
                    relevant date from which time should run, there is no serious argument that the
                    appointment of the 2nd DC would not clearly comport with s 41(3) of
                    the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is only because the Applicant seeks to
                    challenge the SMC’s decision to appoint the 2nd DC that she is
                    obliged to establish illegality and thus run the argument that the material date
                    from which time runs must be the date of the Complaints Committee’s order
                    of 17 November 2008. By these means, the Applicant seeks to challenge the
                    SMC’s appointment of the 2nd DC on 14 September 2010 as not
                    being “immediately” under s 41(3) of the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the light of what I have concluded, it is
                    not strictly necessary for me to deal with this submission, but I shall
                    nevertheless deal with it. Where Parliament has not stated in the legislation
                    what would be the consequence of a failure to observe matters like a time
                    prescription, the courts have formulated criteria to determine whether such a
                    failure is fatal or not. If the court determines that the prescription is
                    mandatory then any non-observance is fatal and, conversely, if directory then
                    any non-observance is not fatal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan
                        Tiang Hin Jerry v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 553 (“<em>Tan Tiang Hin
                        Jerry</em>”) adopted (at [47]) the following approach in determining whether a statutory
                    requirement is to be regarded as mandatory or directory (citing S A de
                    Smith, <em>Judicial Review of Administrative Action</em>
                    (Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 3rd<sup> </sup>Ed, 1973) at
                    p 123):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The courts must therefore formulate their own criteria for
                        determining whether the procedural rules are to be regarded as mandatory, in
                        which case disobedience will render void or voidable what has been done, or
                        as directory, in which case disobedience will be treated as an irregularity
                        not affecting the validity of what has been done (though in some cases it
                        has been said that there must be “substantial compliance” with
                        the statutory provisions if the deviation is to be excused as a mere
                        irregularity). Judges have often stressed the impracticability of specifying
                        exact rules for the assignment of a procedural provision to the appropriate
                        category. The whole scope and purpose of the enactment must be considered,
                        and one must assess “the importance of the provision that has been
                        disregarded, and the relation of that provision to the general object
                        intended to be secured by the Act”. Furthermore, much may depend upon
                        the particular circumstances of the case in hand. Although
                        “nullification is the natural and usual consequence of
                        disobedience,” breach of procedural or formal rules is likely to be
                        treated as a mere irregularity if the departure from the terms of the Act is
                        of a trivial nature, or if no substantial prejudice has been suffered by
                        those for whose benefit the requirements were introduced, or if serious
                        public inconvenience would be caused by holding them to be mandatory, or if
                        the court is for any reason disinclined to interfere with the act or
                        decisions that is impugned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should also be noted that the High Court in <em>Chai
                        Chwan v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2009] SGHC 115 also took
                    the view (at [68]) that the requirement
                    of an immediate appointment under s 41(3) of the MRA was directory and not
                    mandatory. I note in passing the following commentary in Lord Woolf
                        <em>et al</em>, <em>De
                        Smith’s Judicial Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    6th Ed, 2007) at para 5-053 (“<em>De
                        Smith’s Judicial Review</em>”) which was made with
                    reference to Lord Hailsham’s speech in <em>London and
                        Clydeside Estates v Aberdeen District Council</em>[1980] 1 WLR
                    182 at 189–190 in which he expressed his preference to abandon the
                    dichotomy of mandatory / directory requirements in favour of characterising the
                    approach as being within a spectrum in which the courts decide in each case when
                    they would nullify a non-compliance with a statutory prescription:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... At one end are cases ‘where a fundamental obligation may have
                        been so outrageously and flagrantly ignored or defied that the subject may
                        safely ignore what has been done and treat it as having no legal
                        consequence’. At the other end of the spectrum the defect may be
                        ‘so nugatory or trivial’ that the authority can proceed on the
                        assumption that ‘if the subject is so misguided as to rely on the
                        fault, the courts will decline to listen to his complaint’. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The MRA does not specify the consequences of a
                    failure to observe the prescription of an immediate appointment in s 41(3)
                    of the MRA. Looking at the objects of the MRA, the unusual recusal and
                    revocation of the appointment of the 1st DC and the absence of any evidence
                    of substantial prejudice, I would regard this time requirement to be directory
                    or, to use Lord Hailsham’s characterisation, as being at the other
                    end of the spectrum, such that a court will decline to listen to such
                    complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Applicant does not dispute that a second
                    disciplinary committee may well be appointed as the 1st DC had not issued
                    any findings or decision. In order to sustain her challenge of the SMC decision
                    which is pivotal to her case, the Applicant proffers the argument that the SMC
                    should have first referred the Complaint to a fresh complaints committee. Only
                    if such a complaints committee orders a formal inquiry by a disciplinary
                    committee could the SMC then order a disciplinary committee immediately in
                    accordance with s 41(3) of the MRA. This is a strained argument which
                    neither stands legal scrutiny nor comports with the structure and objectives
                    contemplated by the disciplinary processes set out in the MRA. As there already
                    is the Complaints Committee order on record, no practical purpose is served by
                    sending the same Complaint to another complaints committee. I should add that
                    the Applicant, quite sensibly, did not take the extreme and untenable position
                    that following the 1st DC’s recusal, the complainant ought to have
                    been required to file a fresh Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Applicant’s next illegality
                    submission is based on s 12 of the MRA which, she submits, requires that
                    the SMC meet physically. The record reveals that the SMC decision to appoint the
                    2nd DC is evidenced in an email. This perfunctory submission fails
                        <em>in limine</em> in light of s 12(5) of the MRA
                    which expressly empowers the SMC to make rules for the conduct of its business.
                    The SMC is statutorily empowered to determine how it will conduct its business.
                    This means it may conduct its business with or without physical meetings. The
                    burden of establishing that the unanimous agreement of all SMC members to a
                    decision evidenced in an email is defective under s 12 of the MRA lies on
                    the Applicant. Other than making the bald assertion that a decision made
                    pursuant to an email is not a physical meeting, the Applicant has nothing more
                    to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was next argued that the Amendment Act came
                    into force by September 2010 before the 2nd DC had been appointed. The
                    amended s 4 of the MRA enlarged the SMC to now comprise two members from
                    each of the two prescribed medical schools, three additional elected members and
                    one additional nominated member. The Applicant argued that the SMC which
                    appointed the 2nd DC had not been fully constituted because on
                    14 September 2010, it was short of two members from a prescribed medical
                    school and one elected member. It was argued that the power to fill SMC
                    vacancies in s 9(1) of the MRA provides a closed list of vacancies which
                    can be filled and this list does not provide that vacancies may be filled if the
                    vacancies arose because of the enlargement of its membership. Thus, it was
                    argued the SMC could not make decisions until all these vacant positions had
                    been filled, a proposition tantamount to saying that the SMC has to suspend all
                    business once the Amendment Act came into force until all these appointments and
                    elections were completed and positions filled. This remarkable argument would
                    not have been run had the Applicant taken the trouble to refer to s 33 of
                    the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Interpretation
                    Act”) instead of s 9 of the MRA. Section 33 of the Interpretation
                    Act expressly provides that the powers of such board, commission, committee or
                    similar body shall not be affected by any vacancy in the membership thereof. I
                    should add that no argument was made that the SMC decision of 14 September
                    2010 was anything other than unanimous.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fairness: Actual Bias </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The nature and scope of this rule against
                    actual and appearance of bias is succinctly stated in <em>De
                        Smith’s Judicial Review</em> at para 10-006 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle expressed in the maxim <em>nemo iudex in sua
                            causa</em> (no one should be a judge in his own cause) refers not
                        only to the fact that no one shall adjudicate his own case; it also refers
                        to the fact that no one should adjudicate a matter in which he has a
                        conflicting interest. In order to give effect to those two aspects of the
                        principle, the concern is not only to prevent the distorting influence of
                            <em>actual bias</em>, but also to protect the
                        integrity of the decision-making process by ensuring that, however
                        disinterested the decision-maker is in fact, the circumstances should not
                        give rise to the <em>appearance of bias</em>. As has
                        been famously said: “justice should not only be done, but should
                        manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The principal consideration of public confidence in a fact-finding
                    tribunal is graphically expressed by Lord Denning in <em>Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon</em> [1969] 1 QB
                    577 at 599:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... There must be circumstances from which a reasonable man would think it
                        likely or probable that justice, or chairman, as the case may be, would, or
                        did, favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other. The court will
                        not inquire whether he did, in fact, favour one side unfairly. <em>Suffice it that reasonable people might think he did. The
                            reason is plain enough. Justice must be rooted in confidence: and
                            confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking:
                            “The judge was biased.”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Applicant argues that the SMC decision to
                    refer the Complaint to the 2nd DC ought to be quashed by reason that it was
                    tainted by actual bias. What is striking is that the Applicant does not allege
                    actual bias on the part of any single official, person, event or conduct. What
                    is even more striking is that the Applicant has made no allegation, and there is
                    nothing on the record, of any personal bias, animus or interest on the part of
                    the incumbent DMS, Professor Satku. No allegation is made and there is
                    nothing on the record which reveals that the DMS, in any way, abused his
                    position as DMS to cause the MOHS to conduct its investigations, to conduct the
                    searches and to file the Complaint. The Applicant does not allege, and there is
                    nothing on the record, that any, a majority, or all the SMC members harboured
                    any animus or had any conflict of interest that evinces actual bias against
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     That being the case, the puzzle remains why at
                    all is the Applicant’s case founded on actual bias? The Applicant feebly
                    invited the court to infer actual bias by reason only of the totality of the
                    circumstances raised below (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> below).
                    The Applicant offered no direct evidence apart from these aggregated
                    circumstances, upon which the court was invited to draw an inference of actual
                    bias. It would be startling for a court of law to draw inferences of actual bias
                    other than from direct evidence. Absent any evidence on the record, I must
                    decline to do so. The Applicant’s case on actual bias on the part of the
                    SMC in deciding to refer the Complaint to the 2nd DC, being totally
                    unsupported on the record, must necessarily fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fairness: Reasonable Apprehension of Bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Applicant’s fall-back argument is
                    then a reasonable apprehension of bias, again, based not on an apprehension
                    arising by reason of the animus, conduct or conflicting interest of any, a
                    majority or the entire SMC. It is instead based on the aggregation of the same
                    circumstances which I will examine below at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The legal test for reasonable apprehension of
                    bias is not the subjective sensitivity, fears or suspicions of the person
                    affected. The legal test is an objective one: whether there are circumstances
                    which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded
                    reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the tribunal was
                    biased (see <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [91]). The
                    circumstances must objectively be well founded and of sufficient gravity. The
                    standard varies depending on whether the decision is an administrative decision
                    and whether the decision is the result of a fact-finding process (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above and <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The court will have regard to the context in
                    which bias is raised (see <em>Lionel James De Souza v
                        Attorney-General</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 552 at [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As the circumstances require, in the context in which the
                        question of bias arises, whether it be because the tribunal has functions
                        which are more administrative than adjudicative or whether it be because the
                        tribunal is a domestic tribunal or whether it be because the tribunal is one
                        the parties have contractually agreed to, the standard of proof of suspicion
                        of bias may vary. Applied in this way, “reasonable suspicion of
                        bias” means suspicion of bias that is well founded and that is of
                        sufficient gravity in the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The approach of the court with respect to the
                    common law principles is succinctly set out by Silber J at first instance and
                    fully quoted with approval by Lord Phillips MR in the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>R v West Midlands and North West Mental Health Review
                        Tribunal</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 311 at [6] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Silber J summarised the relevant principles to be
                        deduced from recent authorities as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“(a) in order to determine whether there was bias in a case
                            where actual bias is not alleged ‘the question is whether the
                            fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts would
                            conclude that there was a real possibility that the Tribunal was
                            biased.’ … It follows that this exercise entails
                            consideration of all the relevant facts as ‘the court must first
                            ascertain all the circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion
                            that the judge was biased’…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) Public perception of a possibility of unconscious bias is the key.
                            It is unnecessary to delve into the characteristics to be attributed to
                            the fair-minded and informed observer. What can confidently be said is
                            that one is entitled to conclude that such an observer will adopt a
                            balanced approach. This idea was succinctly expressed in <em>Johnson v Johnson</em> [2000] 200 CLR 488, 509 at
                            paragraph 53 by Kirby J when he stated that ‘a <b><em>reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly
                                sensitive or suspicious</em></b>’ (per Lord Steyn in
                                <em>Lawal v Northern Spirit Limited</em> [2003]
                            ICR 856,862 [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) in ascertaining whether there is a case of unconscious bias, the
                            courts must look at the matter by examining other similar analogous
                            situation. ‘One does not come to the issue with a clean slate; on
                            the contrary, the issue of unconscious bias has cropped up in various
                            contexts which may arguably throw light on the problem’
                            (Lord Steyn in <em>Lawal v Northern Spirit
                                Limited</em> (supra) 862 [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the approach of the court is that ‘one starts by identifying
                            the circumstances which are said to give rise to bias … [a court]
                            must concentrate on a systematic challenge and apply a principled
                            approach to the facts on which it is called to rule’
                            (per Lord Steyn in <em>Lawal v Northern Spirit
                                Limited</em> (supra) 864-5 [20])</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) the need for a Tribunal to be impartial and independent means that
                            ‘it must also be impartial for an objective viewpoint, that is it
                            must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this
                            respect’ (<em>Findlay v United Kingdom</em>
                            (1997) 24 EHRR 221 at 224-245 and quoted with approval by Lord
                            Bingham of Cornhill in <em>R v Spear</em> [2003]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The starting point of the analysis of whether
                    the SMC decision was fairly made is the context of the statutory framework and
                    the consequences of the SMC’s decision under s 41(3) of the MRA. The
                    SMC is not the fact-finding or decision-making body with respect to the
                    substance or merits of the Complaint. The statutory framework and process
                    require referral first to the Chairman of the Complaints Panel who shall lay it
                    before a complaints committee which is the body to determine whether a formal
                    inquiry is necessary and, only where it so decides, issue an order for a formal
                    inquiry. The SMC is then consequentially obliged under s 41(3) of the MRA,
                    to appoint a disciplinary committee to hear and investigate the complaint. The
                    SMC has not been statutorily conferred with any discretion to decide whether or
                    not to refer the complaint in light of the Complaints Committee order to a
                    disciplinary committee. The establishment of a pool of eligible medical
                    practitioners from whom the Chairman, Complaints Panel and the SMC respectively
                    appoint each complaints committee and each disciplinary committee is a separate
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     To restate the question before me in simple
                    terms: was the SMC decision, unanimously made by all members, to refer the
                    Complaint to the 2nd DC, taken under s 41(3) of the MRA, made in such
                    circumstances as might cause a reasonable member of the public, who is neither
                    complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious, to have a reasonable apprehension
                    of bias on the part of the SMC?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I now proceed to examine each of the
                    circumstances raised by the Applicant. The Applicant points to the following
                    general circumstances for purposes of making her case of actual bias or
                    reasonable apprehension thereof : (a) the role of the incumbent DMS Professor
                    Satku, whose meeting with the MOHB led him to invite it to write in to the MOHS,
                    followed by the MOHS’s investigation and the separate search, all of which
                    culminated in the MOHS’s filing of the Complaint against the Applicant ;
                    (b) the composition and recusal of the 1st DC and the alleged remarks and
                    the presence of the SMC’s in-house counsel at one of the
                    1st DC’s recesses; and (c) the SMC’s decision-making
                    process in appointing the 2nd DC. The Applicant caps her case with a high
                    abstraction of “systemic bias” on the part of the SMC by reason of
                    the SMC’s failure to: (i) inquire into the deficiencies in the
                    disciplinary process; (ii) take remedial steps to ensure that the Applicant will
                    not have to endure the process again; and (iii) provide documents requested by
                    the Applicant, for which she has made a discovery application in court (see
                        <em>Lim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 132 (judgment for the discovery application)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The multiple roles of the incumbent DMS and the fact that the
                1st DC members and an expert witness were SMC members</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Applicant suggests only that the DMS had a
                    conflict of interest in his position as an SMC member, arising from his multiple
                    earlier roles. The DMS as DMS MOHS first met the Permanent Secretary, MOHB from
                    whom he learnt of MOHB’s concerns relating to the Applicant’s
                    invoices for services rendered to the Patient. The DMS then invited the MOHB to
                    write in to the MOHS. Following the letter from the MOHB to the MOHS, the MOHS
                    conducted a preliminary investigation. Searches were then conducted of the
                    Applicant’s clinics. Finally, the MOHS filed the Complaint against the
                    Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is not doubted that the DMS MOHS is in a
                    position of importance and influence within the MOHS. The administrative
                    machinery of the MOHS came into play to conduct a preliminary investigation and
                    conduct searches before filing the Complaint. This is an expectedly routine
                    administrative process. There can be no legal objection and certainly no
                    inherent conflict of interest arising only from the DMS’s statutory
                    multiple roles including that of being the Registrar and member of the SMC
                    provided that he was not a member of any complaints committee or disciplinary
                    committee hearing and investigating the same complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The crux of the challenge is that the SMC
                    decision of 14 September 2010 gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of
                    bias on the part of the SMC because this same DMS was a statutory member and
                    Registrar of the SMC. Added to this mix were also two members and an expert
                    witness in the 1st DC who were members of the same SMC which made the
                    14 September 2010 decision. The Applicant submits that this must lead to
                    the conclusion of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the whole SMC,
                    including all the other independent SMC members. The question is how so? I
                    proceed to examine the record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The record reveals that all SMC members
                    received the 13 September 2010 email appointing the 2nd DC, and no
                    responses were received from any SMC member prior to the return date and
                    accordingly the SMC decision on 14 September 2010 to appoint a 2nd DC
                    was made unanimously. There is nothing in the record that the DMS or the members
                    and witness of the 1st DC personally lobbied, persuaded or procured the
                    other SMC members to decide to refer the matter to the 2nd DC. Even so, had
                    the SMC been in a fact-finding role, given the previous roles of the DMS or the
                    1st DC members and witness, their inclusion in such a fact-finding decision
                    could in principle infringe the fairness / natural justice standards (see
                        <em>Hannam v Bradford City Council</em> [1970]
                    1 WLR 937 and <em>Re Chuang Wei Ping</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 357). However, the SMC’s decision under s 41(3) of the
                    MRA is not a fact-finding decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Having in view the nature of the SMC’s
                    non-fact-finding decision, the unanimous decision and the absence of any
                    responses by any SMC member to the email by the return date, that the DMS, the
                    1st DC members and a witness received the email in their capacity as SMC
                    members <em>per se</em> provides nothing on which a
                    reasonable person could begin to form a reasonable apprehension of bias on the
                    part of the whole SMC. In fact, countervailing factual evidence to the contrary
                    appears on the record which reveals that the SMC approved the composition of the
                    2nd DC to include two newly elected members who were not previously SMC
                    members when the 1st DC was appointed, with one being a private sector
                    medical practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The composition and recusal of the 1st DC and the presence of
                the SMC’s in-house counsel at one of the 1st DC’s
                recesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The second circumstance raised by the
                    Applicant is that of the composition and recusal of the 1st DC and the
                    conduct of the SMC’s in-house legal counsel. The 1st DC comprised
                    Associate Professor Chin Jing Jih, Associate Professor Ong Biauw Chi,
                    Dr Wong Yue Sie ( his death creating a vacancy, which was filled by the
                    SMC’s appointment of Associate Professor Annette Jacobsen) ,
                    Ms Serene Wee (lay person) and Mr Giam Chin Toon SC (legal
                    assessor). The Applicant complains that the 1st DC members did not disclose
                    to her that they were doctors employed by the Ministry of Health Holdings Pte
                    Ltd. The legal basis of any obligation to make such disclosure is obscure and
                    the employment status of these doctors is readily available from Google searches
                    and other sources of public information. If any of them had a conflict of
                    interest this could have been challenged before the 1st DC and in any
                    subsequent judicial review challenge of the 1st DC’s decisions.
                    Insofar as the Applicant challenges the employment status of the
                    1st DC’s members as providing grounds for reasonable apprehension of
                    bias, this was statutorily met by s 40(11) of the MRA which provides that
                    no SMC member who is employed by the MOHS shall be disqualified from being a
                    member of a complaints committee or disciplinary committee by reason only that
                    he or the complainant is so employed. If it is statutorily not a
                    disqualification for a MOHS employee, on that ground alone, to be appointed a
                    member of a complaints committee or disciplinary committee <em>a
                        fortiori</em> it would not be a disqualification for any such persons
                    only on the ground of their being employees of the restructured corporate
                    hospitals whose shares are held by the Ministry of Health Holdings Pte Ltd.
                        <em>A fortiori</em> with respect to the more remote
                    membership of the non-fact-finding SMC whose decision it was to appoint any
                    disciplinary committee. Accordingly, there is no legal basis to challenge the
                    constitution of the 1st DC by reason only that it comprised employees of
                    the public sector corporatized hospitals. Further, the Applicant was not able to
                    establish on the record how the composition of the 1st DC is linked to all
                    the other SMC members such as to infect their unanimous decision to appoint the
                    2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Turning next to the recusal of the
                    1st DC, the independent decision of the 1st DC, with the availability
                    of the legal assessor, to recuse itself after hearing the submissions of the
                    Applicant’s legal counsel is something the 1st DC was properly
                    entitled to decide on its own. On its face, the independent decision of the
                    1st DC to recuse itself in the light of a prejudgment challenge, carries no
                    necessary connection to all the other SMC members who decided on
                    14 September 2010 to appoint the 2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Applicant further postulates that the SMC
                    ought to have first conducted an inquiry into the recusal before proceeding to
                    appoint the 2nd DC and that its failure to have done so creates a
                    reasonable apprehension of bias. This has no foundation because there is no
                    statutory obligation on the SMC to conduct any inquiry into a recusal nor is
                    this a statutory precondition to the appointment of the
                2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Applicant next raises the circumstances
                    relating to the role of, and remarks attributed to, the SMC’s in-house
                    counsel. First, the SMC’s in-house counsel had been present in the private
                    room of the 1st DC when it, together with its legal assessor, retired for a
                    hearing break. There was a dispute in court on the number of such occasions but
                    nothing on the record revealed whether there was more than one occasion. Second,
                    remarks were attributed to the in-house counsel by one SMC member in his letter
                    dated 16 September 2010 which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to my conversation with you [Ms Serene Wong, the Senior Manager of
                        the Professional Conduct and Professional Standards Division of the SMC] on
                        Tuesday 14 September, followed by a discussion with Ms Kalyani, our
                        legal counsel, regarding the need to revoke the appointment of the members
                        of the Disciplinary Committee who have been hearing Dr Susan Lim Mey
                        Lee’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In your Email dated 3 September 2010 you state that the members
                        hearing the case had recused themselves. One dictionary meaning of recuse
                        states, “to withdraw from a position of judging so as to avoid any
                        semblance of partiality or bias”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It therefore follows that in effect all the members have stepped down from
                        their appointed positions as members of the erstwhile Disciplinary
                        Committee. To seek approval at this stage to revoke the appointment of the
                        erstwhile members of the Disciplinary Committee could be misconstrued by
                        these members as an attempt to reprimand them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Despite Ms Kalyani’s belief that they will not sue us (ie the SMC
                        and its members) “<em>because they are on our
                            side</em>” the possibility remains that being medical
                        professionals of substance in their own respective spheres of work they may
                        feel that any blemish on their professional or personal reputation if left
                        unchallenged may embarrass them in the future. For these reasons I regret
                        that I am unable to give my approval to revoke their appointment, in which
                        case the approval to appoint a list of members to a new Disciplinary
                        Committee will have to be taken up later as a separate issue and not as a
                        consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The record reveals only that the in-house
                    counsel was present with the 1st DC and its legal assessors, in the absence
                    of the concurrent presence of the defence counsel, for the purpose of assisting
                    with logistical/administrative arrangements on the first day of the inquiry and
                    that the in-house counsel did not communicate with the 1st DC on any other
                    matter. The presence of the in-house counsel even if for
                    logistical/administrative purposes in the absence of the concurrent presence of
                    the defence counsel, was ill-judged. Had the 1st DC proceeded to issue its
                    findings and decision, such circumstances on the record could provide a legal
                    ground upon which a court might quash its findings and decision (see <em>R v Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, ex p Hook</em>
                    [1976] 1 WLR 1052). I come next to the letter in which remarks were
                    attributed to the in-house counsel. Read in the context of the entire letter,
                    the Applicant’s reading of the alleged remarks taken out of context does
                    not stand scrutiny. The context of the alleged remark is the possibility of a
                    lawsuit against the SMC by reason of its decision to recuse the entire
                    1st DC. In this context, the alleged remark by the in-house legal counsel
                    was that she believed that the members of the 1st DC would not file a
                    lawsuit against the SMC as they are themselves members of the SMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Applicant’s target however remains
                    the SMC, not the 1st DC. The Applicant makes no allegation and there is
                    nothing on the record that the in-house counsel advised the SMC to appoint the
                    2nd DC. In any case, the Applicant was unable to show how the conduct and
                    alleged remark of the in-house counsel are linked to all the SMC members as to
                    infect their unanimous decision on 14 September 2010 to appoint the
                    2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The SMC’s decision making process in appointing the
                2nd DC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Applicant next complains that the
                    3 September 2010 SMC email misrepresented the nature and significance of
                    the recusal of the 1st DC inasmuch as it did not mention that the recusal
                    of the 1st DC was on the grounds of prejudgment and that its significance
                    was understated by it being characterised as a procedural matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The critical minimum content of the email,
                    given the decision that the SMC was to take, comprises: (a) what decision the
                    SMC was to take; and (b) why it was necessary for this decision to be taken.
                    Brevity, clarity and comprehensiveness in email decisions are to be commended
                    and not faulted. In any event, it remained at all times open to the SMC members
                    to request more details which they do not on the record appear to have required.
                    The email does in fact explain its brevity in the following cautionary
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the hearing on 29 Jul 2010, the Defence Counsel made a procedural
                        application for the Disciplinary Committee (DC) to recuse itself. Details of
                        this case can be given <u>only</u> at the conclusion
                        of the inquiry and until then we seek your kind understanding and patience
                        on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Applicant then submits that there is no
                    reason why the SMC members could not have been given details of the recusal
                    until the conclusion of the inquiry. The precaution of non-disclosure of the
                    deliberations or reasons of the 1st DC must surely be obvious. The brevity
                    protects the integrity of the disciplinary process and preserves the
                    confidentiality of the deliberations of the 1st DC given the context that
                    the 2nd DC is to be appointed by the SMC to hear the very same Complaint.
                    Any further selective disclosure, short of releasing the entire transcript of
                    the hearing, carries the above risks. The release of the entire transcript of
                    the hearing would prejudice the Applicant given that the SMC’s decision
                    was to refer the matter for a formal inquiry by the 2nd DC, at least two of
                    whom would, under s 42(1)(a) of the MRA, include SMC members. The Applicant
                    further complains that the recusal of the 1st DC was neither a procedural
                    matter nor an administrative matter. There can be no real objection to this
                    choice of words. In these circumstances, the defence counsel had indeed made a
                    procedural application to the 1st DC. It is indeed an administrative matter
                    for the SMC to first revoke the appointment of the 1st DC prior to
                    “mov[ing] forward on this matter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on reasonable apprehension of bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Each of the circumstances raised by the
                    Applicant, when examined closely, is not, and all of them, when aggregated, are
                    not well founded or of sufficient gravity to cause any reasonable person who is
                    neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious with knowledge of all the
                    relevant facts to have a reasonable apprehension that the entire SMC was biased
                    when it decided, without making any finding of fact, to appoint the 2nd DC
                    to hear and investigate the Complaint. They are weightless and insubstantial
                    spins, which do not bear scrutiny in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wednesbury Irrationality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The <em>Wednesbury</em>
                    case and the test it laid out are well known. A decision will only be considered
                    irrational if the administrative body in question took into consideration
                    matters that it should not have taken into account, failed to take into
                    consideration matters which it was bound to consider or if the decision was so
                    absurd that no reasonable body could have made such a decision (see <em>Wednesbury</em> at 229).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Applicant submits that the SMC decision to
                    appoint a 2nd DC, and any fresh complaints committee or disciplinary
                    committee order or decision, on the Complaint would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational. The Applicant submits on <em>Wednesbury</em> irrationality on the basis of: (a) the
                    evidence adduced by the prosecution before the 1st DC; (b) the absence
                    of any rule regulating the quantum of fees that a doctor may charge a patient;
                    (c) the absence of any abuse of the doctor-patient relationship; and
                    (d) the other reasons detailed in the written no case to answer submissions
                    before the 1st DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     To recap, the only decision the SMC is to make
                    under s 41(3) of the MRA is to appoint a disciplinary committee once a
                    complaints committee has issued an order for a formal inquiry. The function of
                    the complaints committee under s 41 of the MRA is only to decide after due
                    inquiry whether or not a formal inquiry by a disciplinary committee is necessary
                    (see <em>Regina v General Medical Council ex p Toth</em>
                    [2000] 1 WLR 2209 at [14(5)]). It is the disciplinary committee which is to
                    hear and investigate the Complaint following which, if established, the
                    disciplinary committee may impose any of the sanctions set out in s 45(2)
                    MRA. If the Complaint is not established, s 46(16) MRA provides that the
                    disciplinary committee shall dismiss the Complaint. The SMC quite properly was
                    not provided with, nor should it have had, the transcript of the 1st DC
                    hearing in making its decision of 14 September 2010 to refer the Complaint
                    for a hearing and investigation by a 2nd DC. The question of whether a
                    patient agreement on fees extinguishes any professional misconduct because there
                    is no rule against such agreements, and the absence of patient abuse or because
                    of other matters raised before the 1st DC are all not questions to be
                    determined by the SMC under s 41(3) of the MRA, nor are they questions to
                    be determined by the complaints committee under s 41 of the MRA, given
                    their respective functions. These questions are to be determined only by the
                    disciplinary committee after a hearing and investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The SMC decision in this case was not a
                    decision that touched on the substance or merits or otherwise of the Complaint.
                    The SMC did not consider matters it should not have considered nor did it fail
                    to consider any matter it was bound to consider. For the SMC to refer the
                    Complaint, as it is required to do by s 41(3) of the MRA, cannot be
                    characterised as being one which no reasonable body could have made. As I have
                    rejected the Applicant’s argument that the SMC was obliged to first refer
                    the Complaint back to a fresh complaints committee, I do not need to consider
                    the <em>Wednesbury</em>irrationality argument with respect
                    to such a fresh complaints committee. With respect to the argument that any
                    disciplinary committee decision against the Applicant would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational, this is hypothetical and
                    premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In summary, the Applicant has been unable to
                    establish that the SMC’s decision to refer the matter to the 2nd DC
                    is <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational. I make no conclusion on
                    her argument that any complaints committee order would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational because it is unnecessary for me to
                    address that argument given my conclusion that a referral to a fresh complaints
                    committee is not necessary under the MRA. Neither do I make any conclusion on
                    whether any disciplinary committee decision would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational because that argument is hypothetical and
                    premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Applicant relying, <em>inter alia</em>, on <em>Low Cze Hong v Singapore
                        Medical Council</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 at [89], also raised considerations of
                    unfairness, prejudice and oppression in support of her application for a
                    Prohibiting Order, to <em>wit</em>, that it would be unfair
                    to her by reason of the delays in hearing and investigating the Complaint, that
                    her defence is known to the prosecution and that she would have to bear the
                    financial costs of a resumed disciplinary committee hearing and investigation.
                    These considerations, taken out of context, do not themselves independently
                    support a Prohibiting Order. In any event, none of these arise from the inaction
                    or delays on the part of the SMC or the 1st DC. These are unavoidable
                    consequences of the recusal of the 1st DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Duty to provide fair regulatory system under s 5of the
                MRA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     It remains for me to examine the
                    Applicant’s high level abstraction that by reason of s 5(f) of the
                    MRA, which vests the responsibility to prescribe and regulate the ethical
                    conduct of medical practitioners in the SMC, the SMC has a legal obligation to
                    ensure a fair disciplinary process and was obliged to review the unusual
                    circumstances resulting in the recusal of the entire 1st DC before deciding
                    to appoint the 2nd DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Applicant first submits that because the
                    SMC is constituted under the MRA to establish and operate the disciplinary
                    processes and has assumed the responsibility for the prosecution of complaints
                    before disciplinary committees, the SMC has created the risk of actual or
                    apparent bias at the core of its regulatory function. In short, it is argued
                    that as the SMC is both regulator and prosecutor, Professor Satku’s
                    role as complainant ought to have been completely excluded from the SMC decision
                    to refer the Complaint to a 2nd DC, by reason of his role as regulator. It
                    is submitted that it is incumbent on the SMC to ensure that the processes
                    wherein the complaints committees and disciplinary committees are selected and
                    operated are fair, transparent and conducted in accordance with natural justice
                    principles. It is averred that the SMC failed to do this by not excluding
                    Professor Satku from the SMC when it made the decision to refer the
                    Complaint to a 2nd DC, given that he had a prior role as regulator in the
                    origin of the Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Section 5 of the MRA indeed empowers the
                    SMC to regulate the ethical standards of medical practitioners. However, the
                    structure of a fair disciplinary process is not set by the SMC. It is set by
                    Parliament in enacting the MRA (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above). In the operation of this statutory disciplinary process, fairness is
                    ensured by the supervision of the court to ensure fair processes are followed in
                    every case. Nothing has been made out in court that the SMC’s decision to
                    refer the Complaint to a 2nd DC is in breach of the applicable legality or
                    fairness / natural justice requirements. The fact alone that the MRA provides
                    that the DMS is <em>statutorily</em> the Registrar and
                    member of the SMC does not in any way denigrate from the statutory disciplinary
                    structure being a fair one. The Applicant’s high level abstraction reliant
                    on s 5 of the MRA does not cohere nor is it supportable with the structure
                    and provisions of the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the Quashing Order and Prohibiting Order Applications

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The application for a Quashing Order of the
                    SMC’s decision to appoint a 2nd DC, in the above premises, must

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Declaration that the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations are
                illegal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Applicant has further applied for a
                    declaration that the enactment of the entire S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations is void because they are contrary to natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     This application is misconceived. The power to
                    make regulations of general application is lawfully that of the SMC under
                    s 70 of the MRA. No authority was cited for the proposition that the courts
                    would declare the mere enactment of regulations to be illegal generally. The
                    courts will determine the legality of enactments only in a real controversy
                    where the provision has been applied. It is quite clear that the courts decide
                    real controversies and do not entertain theoretical or hypothetical issues. See
                    Carleton Kemp Allen, <em>Law and Orders: An Inquiry into the
                        Nature and Scope of Delegated Legislation and Executive Powers in English

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is a principle of our jurisprudence – and, it is to be
                        supposed, of most systems of law – that courts will not entertain
                        purely hypothetical questions. They will not pronounce upon legal situations
                        which <em>may</em> arise, but generally upon those
                        which have arisen. If, however, there is an <em>existing</em> basis of right or obligation, it is sometimes of
                        great advantage to an interested party to establish his position before it
                        is put to the test of a joinder of issue. To take a simple illustration:
                        nobody can come to the court to ascertain what his position <em>will</em> be <em>if</em> his rich
                        uncle makes a promised disposition by will in his favour. This is, in legal
                        terminology, a mere <em>spes</em>, and one which
                        experience teaches is often frustrated. If, on the other hand, an intestate
                        estate has fallen to be administered, and the administrator makes it known
                        that he wrongfully claims, as part of the estate, property which clearly
                        belongs to X, X, being in jeopardy of merely vexatious litigation, is
                        entitled to come to the Court for a declaration that the administrator has
                        no right or title to X’s property.</p>

                        determine this question in the abstract. It is quite true that, in a proper
                        case, the court will determine matters of this kind in a <em>quia time</em>t action, but there must be before the court,

                        satisfactory evidence that the defendant is threatening or intending to do

                        will lead to serious damage to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short, whether the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations are
                    contrary to natural justice is a question that the court will determine when the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The 2nd DC has not actually applied
                    reg 42 because the 2nd DC’s inquiry has not proceeded further by
                    reason of these applications. However, the record shows that during the
                    2nd DC’s pre-inquiry conference meeting, the 2nd DC’s
                    legal assessor mentioned that he had advised the 2nd DC that reg 42,

                    2nd DC’s proceedings. It might therefore be argued that there is a
                    “threatened” application of reg 42 as amended by the
                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations. On that view, it might be argued that
                    this application is not hypothetical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I am of the view, however, that this
                    application remains hypothetical because, contrary to the 2nd DC’s

                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, is not applicable to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the first place, the S 528/2010

                    of disciplinary committees, representation procedures prior to the issue of
                    disciplinary charges, alteration of charges and consolidation of charges in
                    relation to those arising from the same transaction, and the holding of joint

                    tendered in the presence of the parties or their representatives, the question

                    writing and given to every party or representative. Under the S 528/2010
                    amendment of reg 42, there is no longer any need to put the legal
                    assessor’s advice in writing and make it available to the parties or their
                    representatives where such advice was tendered in their absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, even reg 42, as amended by the
                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, has no application to the Applicant. The
                    Attorney’s counsel early in these proceedings had submitted that
                    reg 42, as amended by the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, did apply
                    to the 2nd DC’s proceedings because the S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations provided that they would come into effect on 20 September 2010.
                    The Attorney’s counsel was closely questioned by the court on whether the
                    accrued substantive right of a defendant in ongoing disciplinary proceedings
                    could be changed midstream to the detriment of such defendant. The
                    Attorney’s counsel reconsidered and subsequently reversed the submission
                    made earlier in court. As reg 42 relates to substantive rights,
                    s 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act provides, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the repeal in whole or in part of any written law
                    (including subsidiary legislation) shall not affect any right acquired or
                    accrued under any such repealed written law unless a contrary intention appears.
                    No contrary intention appears because there were no transitional provisions in
                    the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Since the S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations, and reg 42 as amended thereunder, are not applicable to the
                    2nd DC’s proceedings, the question of whether reg 42, as
                    amended, and the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations are contrary to natural
                    justice is hypothetical to the Applicant in this judicial review
                    proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Applicant also raises a further submission
                    that the enactment of the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations on
                    16 September 2010, which were brought into force on 20 September 2010,
                    was directed at the Applicant’s 2nd DC hearing. Apart from the timing
                    of their enactment, however, the Applicant has not explained in court as to how
                    they are directed at her. As shown above, the contents of the Amendment
                    Regulations are mostly of general application and neutral (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It should be noted that this submission has no
                    bearing on the question of whether the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations are
                        <em>substantively</em> contrary to natural justice. I
                    have already observed that that question is hypothetical (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above). This argument was raised in support
                    of the Applicant’s submissions that the SMC decision to appoint the
                    2nd DC and shortly thereafter enact amendments to reg 42 in the
                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of
                    bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     A close analysis of the content and chronology
                    of the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations reveals that this submission has no
                    merit. The S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations introduced these new procedures
                    relating to disciplinary committees pursuant to s 70 of the MRA. In
                    December 2010, the Medical Registration Regulations 2010 (S 733/2010)
                    (“the S 733/2010 MRR”) were enacted to consolidate the
                    S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations with all preceding unrevoked
                    regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The S 733/2010 MRR also contains further
                    refinements to the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, which the Applicant
                    complains, indicates that the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations were rushed
                    to enactment and directed at the 2nd DC hearing. The new refinements under
                    the S 733/2010 MRR are primarily to rename the “Disciplinary
                    Committee” as the “Disciplinary Tribunal”. This change
                    could only be introduced in the regulations after the coming into effect of the
                    Amendment Act on 1 December 2010 by r 2 of Gazette
                    Notification 732/2010. The SMC could not as a matter of law have enacted
                    this change earlier in September 2010 in the S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations as these particular MRA amendments had not been brought into effect
                    then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The other material amendment in the
                    S 733/2010 MRR is the further refinement to reg 42 (which is now
                    renumbered as reg 67 in the S 733/2010 MRR) which <em>inter alia</em> provides that any advice tendered during the
                    Disciplinary Tribunal’s deliberations need not be provided to the parties
                    or representatives. However, reg 72(c) of the S 733/2010 MRR provides
                    a transitional provision that notwithstanding the revocation of all the previous
                    Medical Registration Regulations, including the S 528/2010 Amendment
                    Regulations, these revoked regulations shall continue to apply to any committee
                    appointed before 1 December 2010, as if they had not been revoked. This
                    means that reg 42 as refined by the S 733/2010 MRR (<em>ie</em>, reg 67 of the S 733/2010 MRR), does not have
                    retrospective effect to extend to any ongoing disciplinary committees to which
                    reg 42, as amended by the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, is
                    applicable. This also means that reg 42, as refined by the S 733/2010
                    MRR, is not applicable to any ongoing disciplinary proceedings to which
                    reg 42 as amended by S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, is itself not
                    applicable. Put simply, neither the refinements in S 733/2010 MRR nor the
                    amendment in the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations made with respect to
                    reg 42 are applicable to the 2nd DC proceedings. The original
                    reg 42 in force on 14 September 2010 (being the date of appointment of
                    the 2nd DC) would remain operative. Given this exact chronology and effect
                    of the various amendments, the Applicant has no basis to harbour any reasonable
                    suspicion that the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations were rushed and
                    directed at the 2nd DC’s hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     If the 2nd DC applies reg 42, as
                    amended by the S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations, or reg 67 of the
                    S 733/2010 MRR (<em>ie</em>, the refined reg 42),
                    notwithstanding the transitional provisions of reg 71 of the
                    S 733/2010 MRR, and those provisions either infringe natural justice or are
                    illegal on other grounds, she remains at liberty to seek judicial review in
                    court of the 2nd DC findings and decision and make her case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Distillation of Applicant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Having analysed and evaluated the
                    Applicant’s case in detail, I will now distil the essence of her
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The Applicant seeks to quash the SMC’s
                    decision to refer the Complaint to the 2nd DC for a hearing and
                    investigation and to prohibit the SMC from any further referral of the same
                    Complaint to any disciplinary committee in future. In order to achieve this, it
                    is necessary in law for the Applicant to establish that the SMC decision to
                    refer the Complaint to the 2nd DC was illegal or biased as alleged.
                    Illegality means that the Applicant had to show that the reference was illegal
                    under the MRA. The MRA does however empower the SMC to appoint the 2nd DC
                    upon the revocation of the entire 1st DC’s appointment. The SMC is
                    also entitled under s 12 of the MRA to determine its own procedures for the
                    conduct of its business whether in physical meetings or otherwise and
                    accordingly its unanimous decision upon an email is in order. That the SMC had
                    several unfilled vacancies created by the Amendment Act when it decided to refer
                    the matter to the 2nd DC is validated by s 33 of the Interpretation
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As for bias, it is necessary for the Applicant
                    to establish actual bias on the part of the SMC. The Applicant makes no
                    allegation and there is nothing on the record to show personal bias or animus or
                    abuse of position on the part of any SMC member. The Applicant invites the court
                    to infer actual bias from no facts. The Applicant’s case for reasonable
                    apprehension of bias is based again not on any specific person or conduct but on
                    an aggregation of circumstances. First, as to any conflict of interest on the
                    part of the DMS, that the DMS has multiple statutory roles, which are roles
                    Parliament has accorded the office of a DMS, cannot in and of itself be evidence
                    of any bias on the part of the SMC to refer the Complaint for a hearing and
                    investigation by a disciplinary committee. Second, the recusal of the
                    1st DC on a challenge of prejudgment is something the 1st DC was
                    entitled to do and there is nothing on the record that can be imputed to the
                    entire SMC such as to legally infect its decision to refer the Complaint to a
                    hearing and investigation by the 2nd DC. The alleged conduct of the
                    SMC’s in-house counsel in the 1st DC hearing is not before this court
                    as the Applicant is not seeking to quash the appointment or recusal of the
                    1st DC. The conduct of the SMC in-house counsel and her alleged remark
                    which is on the record and taken out of context, in any event, cannot be imputed
                    to the entire SMC such as to legally infect all the SMC members who decided to
                    refer the Complaint to a hearing and investigation by a 2nd DC. Finally,
                    the Applicant submits a high level abstraction based on s 5 of the MRA to
                    construct a legal obligation on the SMC to create and maintain a fair system.
                    This, the Applicant submits, the SMC has failed to do. Section 5 of the MRA
                    does not however confer the obligation to create a fair system on the SMC. It is
                    the MRA itself which creates the fair system. The SMC’s obligation to
                    maintain or operate this system is subject to the legal grounds of judicial
                    review. The Applicant has not, on the record, been able to establish any of
                    these grounds in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    To prevent the SMC from convening any future
                    disciplinary committees to inquire into the same Complaint, the
                    Applicant’s case for a Prohibiting Order is that it would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational for the SMC, any complaints
                    committee or any disciplinary committee to do so. The transcript of the
                    1st DC proceedings having properly not been made available to the SMC,
                    there is nothing on the record to show that the SMC had not considered any
                    matter it should have considered, nor that it omitted considering anything it
                    should not have omitted considering. Given that the SMC is not the fact-finding
                    body, but is to refer the Complaint for a hearing and investigation by a
                    disciplinary committee, the referral cannot be one which no reasonable body
                    could have made. As I have rejected the Applicant’s argument that the SMC
                    was obliged to first refer the Complaint back to a fresh complaints committee, I
                    do not need to consider the <em>Wednesbury</em>irrationality argument with respect to such a fresh
                    complaints committee. As there is no disciplinary committee decision to date,
                    any argument of <em>Wednesbury</em> irrationality on the
                    part of any disciplinary committee is, for now, hypothetical and premature. As
                    for considerations of “unfairness, prejudice and oppression”,
                    these are not independent legal grounds but considerations. In this case, the
                    delays and costs did not arise by inaction of the SMC or the 1st DC. These
                    are the unavoidable consequences of the recusal of the
                1st DC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    As for the Declaration application, the
                    application to declare that the entire S 528/2010 Amendment Regulations is
                    illegal is overstated as they cover a multiplicity of matters which have no
                    obvious bearing on the 2nd DC hearing. The application that the amended
                    reg 42 is in breach of natural justice is hypothetical as it has no
                    application the 2nd DC hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Applicant will have another day in court
                    (apart from any appeal from my judgment) should she seek judicial review of the
                    2nd DC findings and decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For all these reasons, the applications are
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
