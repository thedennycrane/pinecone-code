<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This judgment deals with AWX’s
                    (“the wife”) claim to a share in the matrimonial assets and
                    maintenance for herself and a child of the marriage, post-divorce. I awarded 55%
                    of the matrimonial assets to AWY (“the husband”) and 45% to the
                    wife. I also awarded maintenance for the child to be fixed at $2,500 a month
                    with the husband paying for all the child’s tuition lessons and
                    chiropractic sessions. I awarded maintenance for the wife to be fixed at $4,000
                    a month. Parties consented to joint custody, with care and control to the wife
                    and reasonable access to the husband. I also ordered all real assets to be sold
                    within 6 months in the open market via a mutually agreed agent, with the wife
                    having the first option to buy over the matrimonial home at the highest offer
                    obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The wife has appealed against my decision to
                    divide the matrimonial assets in the proportion above, as well as my decision to
                    not include as part of the matrimonial assets, the money in a fixed deposit
                    account in the joint names of the husband and his mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The husband has appealed against my decision
                    regarding the quantum of maintenance for the wife and for the child, as well as
                    my decision on the division of matrimonial assets in the proportion above. I now
                    set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties were married in 1978 and remained
                    married for 32 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    During the marriage, the couple had two children, both girls. The first was born
                    in 1982 and the second was born in 1996. Currently, the husband is a Senior
                    Consultant at a local hospital, and the wife is a part-time general
                    practitioner. Based on the Notice of Assessment issued by IRAS for the year
                    2010, the husband earned $392,898.00 a year<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> ($32,741.50
                    a month) and the Wife earned $36,412 a year<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> ($3,034.33 a
                    month).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the time of the marriage, both parties worked
                    full time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, and
                    for a large part of the marriage, the husband was the breadwinner of the family.
                    He stated that he earned about 91% of the household income over 32 years of
                        marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Throughout the entirety of the marriage,
                    the husband had been fully responsible for all the household expenses, the
                    maid’s expenses, the children’s expenses and the car
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The
                    wife took care of the home and worked intermittently<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, and mostly on a part time
                        basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The wife stopped
                    working after the birth of their second child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The wife commenced divorce proceedings against
                    the husband on 5 October 2009 on an uncontested basis due to the
                    husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Interim Judgment for Divorce was granted
                    on 7 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Disputed matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Parties differed in their views on two specific
                    issues relating to the composition of the matrimonial assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether a fixed deposit account in
                        the joint names of the husband and his mother was part of the matrimonial
                        assets,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
                        an account in the husband’s parents’ joint names was part of the
                        matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Parties dealt with these issues at two hearings
                    on 3 November 2011 and 9 November 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The fixed deposit account in the joint names of the husband and his
                mother</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After hearing the parties, I decided on a
                    balance of probabilities that the money in the fixed deposit account in the
                    joint names of the husband and his mother belonged to the husband’s
                    mother. The husband’s mother had filed an affidavit stating that the money
                    in the joint fixed deposit account belonged to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The husband’s mother had made
                    transfers into this joint account from 2002 – 2008. I found that any
                    assertion by the wife that alluded to the husband systematically dissipating or
                    siphoning money via this route ran contrary to the objective facts; namely that
                    the transfers began in 2002, long before marital problems arose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In my view, it was rather unlikely for
                    the husband to have foreseen the breakdown of the marriage in 2002 and started
                    planning the dissipation or siphoning of matrimonial assets so many years in
                    advance in order to avoid having to account for them to the wife in the course
                    of the division of matrimonial assets following the interim judgment in June
                    2010. Accordingly, the money in this fixed deposit account in the joint names of
                    the husband and his mother was not part of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As a safeguard and on my directions, the
                    husband had, on 10 November 2011, made a statutory declaration stating that
                    all the money in this joint fixed deposit account was money that belonged
                    entirely to his mother. I further directed that copies of this statutory
                    declaration be sent to his brother in Australia, to counsel for the wife, and to
                    his mother. This was to notify all possibly interested parties of the money in
                    the joint fixed deposit account and to prevent the husband from later claiming
                    the money as his own.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Account in husband’s parents’ joint names</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I decided that the money in the account in the
                    husband’s parents’ joint names was part of the matrimonial assets.
                    This account contained $167,487.72. The husband’s case was that it was out
                    of love and filial duty that he gave money regularly to his mother, depositing
                    this money into a UOB account in Singapore under his parent’s joint
                        names.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Unlike the account in the joint names of the
                    husband and his mother, there was no evidence of a long and continuing trend of
                    payments. Instead, there was just one page in the affidavit which reflected the
                    current balance in the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the hearing before me on 9 November
                    2011, it was the husband’s position that the money in this account was
                    also for medical expenses. I posed the question as to whether this was ever used
                    for medical expenses as argued. The response was that it was never used for
                    medical expenses, but earmarked as such. I was not convinced, based on the
                    production of a single bank account balance document, that there was a regular
                    stream of payments to the husband’s mother as claimed. I was also not
                    convinced that, without more, these sums were to be used for medical expenses,
                    when it was clear that no money from the account was ever used as
                such.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Husband’s joint accounts with daughters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I should also add that, by the parties’
                    consent, money in the older daughter’s joint account with the husband with
                    DBS was to be placed in a new account solely in the name of the older daughter.
                    Similarly, money in the joint account of the younger daughter and the husband
                    with POSB was to be placed in a new account solely in the name of the younger
                    daughter. The monies in both the husband’s joint accounts with the
                    daughters were, by consent, to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets
                    for division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is useful to set out the factors the court
                    will take into consideration in the division of matrimonial assets. These are
                    set out in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Power of court to order division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to
                        exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have
                        regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following
                        matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money,
                            property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the
                            matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either
                            party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare
                            of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family
                            or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership
                            and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of
                            divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other
                            party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of
                            assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of
                            his or her occupation or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(h) the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are
                            relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The law relating to the division of
                    matrimonial assets was recently set out in <em>Yeo Chong Lin v
                        Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157
                        (“<b><em>Yeo Chong Lin</em></b>”), where the
                    Court of Appeal stated (at [76]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 112(2) of the Charter provides a non-exhaustive list of factors
                        which a court is required to have regard in determining how the matrimonial
                        assets are to be divided. A wide discretion is conferred upon the court. The
                        section does not prescribe the weight which should be attributed to each
                        factor or how each factor should be regarded as against another factor. In
                        most instances, the difficulty lies in evaluating the non-financial
                        contributions of the homemaker wife as such contributions are not easily
                        reducible into monetary terms. In <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua
                            Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520  
                            ("<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>") this court noted (at
                            [39]) that non-financial
                        contributions were by their very nature "difficult to measure because they
                        are, intrinsically, incapable of being measured in precise financial terms".
                        That having been said, the court went on to state that such difficulty
                        should never be a ground to refuse that spouse his or her equitable share in
                        the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In addition, a broad brush approach should be
                    adopted to reach what the court holds is a just and equitable division. In
                        <em>Yeo Chong Lin</em>, it was held that this meant
                    that “the court is not expected to make an exact calculation of each
                    spouse’s contributions, whether financial or non-financial”. In the
                    same case, it was held that each case was fact sensitive and the overarching
                    guidance Parliament set out as the objective of the court was to come to a
                    “just and equitable decision”. This comes down to “feel and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having gone through the evidence presented
                    before me, I decided on the 55:45 division of matrimonial assets for the
                    following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The marriage lasted 32 years</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This was a long marriage. I have no doubt that
                    both parties gave each other the best years of their lives. As set out in
                        <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 659 at [43], parties
                    to the marriage “often have unequal abilities whether as parents or
                    income earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talents should
                    not result in unequal rewards <em>where the contributions are
                        made consistently and over a long period of time</em>”
                    [emphasis added]. On the evidence, both parties, despite their unequal
                    abilities, did contribute consistently to the household in monetary and
                    non-monetary terms over a long period of time. I now go on to illustrate these
                    contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Both parties made substantial contributions in the differing spheres
                of family life</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The wife was, at times, working, but it was
                    evident she assumed the homemaking role. The husband was the breadwinner of the
                    family. However, in saying this, I noted that the wife had made a substantial
                    contribution towards the payment of the first matrimonial home. I will address
                    the wife’s contribution to the properties acquired later in my
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Husband’s career</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The husband earned a comfortable salary.
                    However, to get to his present position, the husband had to put in the hours at
                    his workplace. For one, he was pursuing his post-graduate degree in Obstetrics
                    and Gynaecology at the time the first child was born. In addition, the wife
                    stated that the husband worked night shifts 3-4 times a week at the
                        hospital.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The job involved having to work through
                    “sleepless nights” and on weekends at times.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He had to work
                    irregular hours and be on call.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> It was stated by the wife, and not
                    denied by the husband, that the wife would bring the older daughter (when she
                    was young) to the hospital to join the husband for dinner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The husband
                    wished to concentrate on his career and build up his practice. By the
                    husband’s own account, he had to continually travel to conferences for
                    professional development. I also noted that the wife had the second child when
                    she was 42 years old. She stated that it was a difficult pregnancy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, and she stopped working
                    to take care of the second child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Taking all these factors into account, I did
                    not accept the husband’s contention that he did not need <em>any</em> help from the wife and could pursue his career and
                    take care of the children and the family at the same time. He stated that he had
                    this ability due to his training as a gynaecologist which allowed him to make
                    sound judgments and decisions despite working odd hours and despite little
                        sleep.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    However, I also found in his affidavit the following: “The quality of
                    life that my family now enjoys largely came from my <em>hard
                        work, perseverance and dedication to </em><b><em>career
                        building</em></b>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span><em>As I am working in a public hospital</em>,<b><em>the needs of the community and country came </em></b><b><em><u>first</u></em></b>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. While he put in the required time and
                    effort in his job, for which his public spiritedness should be applauded, his
                    wife was at home taking care of the household. On the facts of this case (see
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>-<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>), it was clear that the husband’s claim of not
                    needing <em>any</em> help from the wife was unsustainable.
                    I would add here that the wife also referred clients to the husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> This helped him to build
                    up his patient base. Therefore, in addition to providing support to the husband
                    by taking care of the home (which aided him in carrying on his occupation or
                    business), the wife also provided assistance to generate more business for the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I now highlight a few examples which would
                    illustrate how the husband needed the help of the wife in taking care of the
                    household.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Wife’s post-delivery actions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The wife went back to work four and a half
                    months after the birth of the couple’s first child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This was despite the
                    wife’s intention to resign from her job and work part time after the
                    delivery of the first child<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, in line with her description of herself
                    as being the “mother type”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. The wife stated that she had to work
                    full time, breastfeed the baby, cook and clean the house. The feeding of the
                    infant took place at odd hours and that meant the wife could only sleep 2 or 3
                    hours every night, which left her exhausted in the day. This went on for one
                        year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The husband stated that this was due to him
                    being mindful that maternity leave was for 8 weeks at the time and that both
                    parties needed their jobs to support the repayment of the loan towards their
                    first matrimonial home. In addition, he “discouraged the Plaintiff from
                    resigning because Credit POSB gave preferential interest rates to staff in the
                    Ministry of Health.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that the
                    wife’s return to work after delivery for the sake of paying off the loan
                        <em>despite</em> her own inclinations to stay at home
                    should be taken into account when I divided the matrimonial assets. To apply an
                    observation by the Court of Appeal in <em>Yeo Chong
                        Lin</em> to the present case, the family here was relatively less well
                    off in the early years of the marriage, and the wife’s role would have
                    been harder then. This was evident during the early years of this marriage,
                    where the wife had to juggle both work and household responsibilities including
                    that of looking after the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The family’s time in Australia: 1984-1985, 2006-2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In 1984, the family moved to Australia and
                    lived there for a year. The wife stated that the family only had help with the
                    chores twice a week for the last few months of their stay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Besides cooking, the wife
                    also took the older daughter to playschool, and taught her how to read. The wife
                    did not work during the year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In 2005, the husband sat for the Australian
                    specialist medical examination so that he could obtain employment that was
                    linked to the grant of Permanent Residency in Australia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The job required the
                    husband to work for two years in what he termed “a small country town of
                    60,000 people”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.
                    Thus he spent 2006 and 2007 in Hervey Bay, Queensland<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. In his Defence for the
                    divorce filed on 27 October 2009, the husband stated that he thought that
                    separation would avoid further friction that could easily arise in a brand new
                    environment, as the marital relationship was becoming unsettled then<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> (this was denied
                    by the wife)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. Subsequently, he stated in his affidavit
                    that he thought it was better for the family to live in Adelaide for safety
                        reasons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The wife asserted that the husband’s
                    reasons were less altruistic; he simply could not concentrate on a new job in a
                    new place and cope with family responsibilities at the same time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Even if the husband’s
                    reason was true, the arrangement would have left the wife to take care of the
                    household. Indeed, the wife took care of the household during her year in
                    Adelaide without the aid of domestic help.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The wife’s role in contributing to the properties acquired
                during marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A lot of ink was spilt in the husband’s
                    affidavit on how the wife looked at the marriage as a business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and how she was obsessed
                    with money. On the wife’s end, she stated that the husband was a poor
                    steward of money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>,
                    had poor judgment when it came to investments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>, and had denied her money to invest in
                        properties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.
                    She stated that the couple had different perspectives when it came to
                    investments. She suggested investments to him and pushed him to invest in said
                    investments. To my mind, these views were not irreconcilable. The wife was right
                    in saying that the couple had different views towards investments. The wife
                    thought property investments were the best way to grow their money. The husband
                    was constantly prodded to provide money towards this goal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> In return, he felt that
                    the wife was obsessed with having money to invest in properties. The
                    wife’s attempts to grow the matrimonial assets were noted. If not for the
                    wife’s astute choice of investment in properties, the total value of
                    matrimonial assets available for distribution might not be as much as what it is
                    now. Her contribution in this regard must also be factored into the division of
                    assets. In addition, she did contribute funds to the purchase of property. In
                        <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 520, it was held (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, in addition to the non-financial contributions of a spouse
                        (more often than not, the wife), attention must be given to his or her
                        direct financial contributions through his or her efforts in increasing the
                        total value of the matrimonial assets. This contribution must be taken into
                        account for the purpose of increasing the proportion of matrimonial assets
                        to be awarded to that spouse. This is not only logical but is also eminently
                        fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The wife contributed to the purchases of the
                    current matrimonial home and previous matrimonial property using CPF as well as
                    proceeds from the sale of previous matrimonial homes. The proceeds of the sale
                    of the first matrimonial home (which, as stated in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, also involved payments by the wife<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>) subsequently went towards
                    the purchase of the second matrimonial home. The purchase of the fourth and
                    current matrimonial home stemmed from financing arising out of the sale of the
                    third matrimonial home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> It
                    was also not disputed that the wife contributed $153,700 from her CPF account to
                    the purchase of the current matrimonial home. Accordingly, it was clear to me
                    that the wife did contribute money towards acquiring the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Further comments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is regrettable that the advice provided by
                    the Court of Appeal in the case of <em>NK v NL</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 743 (“<b><em>NK v NL</em></b>”)
                    was not heeded and the affidavits alluded to a number of allegations relating to
                    extramarital relationships. To reiterate, the court in <em>NK v
                        NL</em> held (at [12]) that in
                    the light of the current “no fault” basis of divorce law, it would
                    serve no purpose to dwell on the question of “who did what”, and
                    that the adulterous behaviour of parties was irrelevant in the determination of
                    the ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Court of Appeal there then went on to
                    state the primary objective of the law: to facilitate the transitional period of
                    emotional upheaval for all parties concerned, not least the children. This
                    salutary objective was lost in the midst of all the crossfire that ensued in the
                    affidavits; in this unfortunate case, it seemed that the elder daughter was now
                    being treated for depression. The husband indicated that this was due to the
                    breakup of a relationship the child was in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The wife stated that the depression was
                    partly due to the dysfunctional family environment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> While causation is
                    difficult to set out in such matters of the heart, the proximity between the
                    timing of the commencement of treatment for depression and the timing of the
                    commencement of divorce proceedings is telling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As set out in <em>NK v
                        NL</em>, the court’s mandate was to come to a just and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial assets having regard to all the circumstances of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     With that in mind, and having considered the
                    factors I listed out above, I adopted a broad brush approach and awarded the
                    husband 55% of the matrimonial assets and the wife 45% of the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In addition, I took the step of evaluating the
                    two proposals that the husband had put forward in his written
                        submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                        with him keeping the remaining properties. These remaining properties were a
                        shophouse in Clementi with a value of S$800,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. The valuations of
                        the Australian properties were disputed, but I proceeded on the
                        husband’s valuation, as I wanted to make the point that even if I had
                        accepted the husband’s proposal, the ultimate result would not be any
                        different from the result I arrived at independent of the proposal. In this
                        particular proposal, he also wanted each party to keep assets held in their
                        own names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I considered but did not think that the first
                    proposal was reasonable. The division of 75:25 was disproportionate in light of
                    the contributions the wife had made to, among other things, the welfare of the
                    family. I then considered the second proposal and I drew up the following table

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The wife’s assets (excluding real
                    property) added up to $1,190,199.47. I found the husband’s assets
                    (excluding real property) to be valued at $$3,387,750.65. I did not include the
                    monies in the joint bank accounts that I had earlier found were not part of the
                    pool of matrimonial assets. These were the monies in (a) the husband’s
                    joint accounts with the elder daughter; (b) the husband’s joint account
                    with the younger daughter; and (c) and the husband’s joint fixed deposit
                    account with his mother. I included the money in the bank account in the
                    husband’s parents’ joint names as though they were a part of the
                    matrimonial assets. In his second proposal, the husband was essentially stating
                    that he should get 55.63% and the wife 44.37% of the matrimonial assets. It is
                    evident that these numbers did not materially differ from the percentages I
                    independently arrived at, having considered the s 112 factors in
                    totality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now turn to the issue of

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Monthly maintenance for the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     At the end of the hearing, I awarded a sum of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Section 114 of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) sets out the matters to be considered in the
                    assessment of maintenance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assessment of maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114. —(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance
                        to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard
                        to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial
                            resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to
                            have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each
                            of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
                            foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown
                            of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to

                            after the home or caring for the family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the
                            value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for
                            example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of
                            the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour
                        so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to
                        their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would
                        have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly
                        discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having regard to Section 114, I decided on the
                    sum of $4,000 per month for the wife’s maintenance with the following
                    considerations in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Considerations in assessing wife’s maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     First, the wife stated in her affidavit that
                    her total monthly expenses during the marriage added up to $10,287.00. This
                    monthly sum comprised the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     wife’s monthly personal
                        expenses ($2786.17);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     monthly household expenses ($2756.10);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     car expenses ($1,800);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     domestic worker expenses ($682.90);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_e"></a>(e)     monthly
                        expenses for the child ($2261.83)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I subtracted the monthly expenses for the
                    child from the sum of the total expenses, as there would be a separate order for
                    maintenance for the child. I also discounted a reasonable sum from the monthly
                    household and domestic worker expenses that would represent the household
                    expenses and maid expenses that should be allocated to the child to form part of
                    the maintenance for the child. After such adjustments, the ordinary expenses for
                    herself alone would probably be in the region of $6,500 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Second, in assessing the maintenance sum, I
                    had in mind the fact that the marriage lasted for 32 years. This was a long
                    marriage where the wife consciously contributed to home life and to the welfare
                    of the family. Despite the husband’s contentions, I find it difficult to
                    believe that the career path towards being a senior consultant in a hospital
                    would not detract <em>at all</em> from family
                life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Third, in coming to the sum of $4,000 as the
                    maintenance sum, I had regard to the standard of living enjoyed by the family
                    before the breakdown of the marriage. This was a family that enjoyed a
                    comfortable quality of life. Moreover, this was a sum the husband could readily
                    afford.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Fourth, I also had regard to the income and
                    earning capacity which the wife was likely to have in the foreseeable future. In
                    deciding the maintenance sum, I was cognizant of the fact that if the wife
                    resumed work now on a part time basis as a locum, she could readily earn at
                    least $2,500 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Fifth, I noted the wife’s argument that
                    the husband’s expenses far exceeded hers in some areas. While that in and
                    of itself did not reflect the wife’s expenses, it did reflect the standard
                    of living that the household was used to and the standard of living that was
                    enjoyed by the family. To provide further context, and as the wife points out,
                    both parties are doctors, with the husband being a specialist in obstetrics and
                    gynaecology. Parties also live in landed property. The standard of living cannot
                    be said to be any less than one of comfort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Sixth, the wife has several medical
                        concerns.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>
                    Among others, she might require hormone replacement therapy. This is due to her
                    irregular and prolonged menses from perimenopausal bleeding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> I took these
                    medical conditions into account in assessing the financial needs the wife had or
                    was likely to have in the foreseeable future. As the $4,000 monthly maintenance
                    together with her potential monthly earning of $2,500 per month as a part time
                    locum was at a level that would meet her ordinary monthly expenses of $6,500 per
                    month, this would mean that she would not need to utilise or draw down on the
                    approximate $4,000,000 dollars that would be her 45% share of the matrimonial
                    assets. Should there be any extraordinary medical expenses that she might have
                    to incur in the future, I think these could be readily taken care of from her
                    share of the matrimonial assets. There was no need to increase the $4,000
                    monthly maintenance to provide for these extraordinary expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Monthly maintenance for the child</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The wife initially sought $5,217.10 as monthly
                    maintenance for the child. She calculated that the child’s personal
                    monthly expenses alone came up to $2,261.83. The husband initially proposed $687
                    as an initial working budget, which he stated he was happy to adjust for the
                    child’s sake from time to time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> However, I noted that this sum did not
                    include a significant number of expenses related to outings, clothing, shoes,
                    holidays and school materials, which were factored in the wife’s
                    calculations. The husband stated that he did not include these expenses as he
                    would pay these sums directly to the child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> In the same affidavit, the husband
                    stated that he was willing to pay $2,650 a month for the child’s
                    maintenance (this was an “all in” sum including personal expenses,
                    household expenses and maid expenses)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     When parties came before me again in November
                    2011, counsel for the husband said that his client was prepared to pay and was
                    willing to do all that could be done for the family. I asked for an updated and
                    itemised breakdown of the child’s expenses, and having received further
                    submissions on 1 November 2011, I varied the maintenance order for the
                    child to $2,500 a month, with the additional stipulation that the husband was to
                    pay separately for the child’s tuition classes, piano lessons, and
                    chiropractic sessions.</p>
