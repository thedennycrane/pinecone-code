</div> The present case, being a creditors’ voluntary winding-up, is materially different from a compulsory winding-up application, which was before the Court in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods</span>. This is because, unlike a case of a compulsory winding-up, no winding-up proceedings are in fact ongoing in a creditors’ voluntary winding-up situation. Accordingly, the Orders granted in the present case, which relate to a company in a creditors’ voluntary winding-up, were not interlocutory orders, and therefore no leave ought to be required to appeal against them.

</div>
</div> I agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 354 (“<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span>”), the Court of Appeal confirmed that an application to administer pre-action interrogatories is not an interlocutory application. This was because (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>at [60]):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… [An application to administer pre-action interrogatories] is an <span class="font-italic">application made by way of originating summons and its only end is the particular relief sought in the originating summons</span>. Once the application for such relief has been considered and ruled upon by the court, that matter ends and those proceedings are not followed by any other steps leading to any trial or further disposal of that matter. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In other words, an application for pre-action interrogatories is not an interlocutory application because, unlike an interlocutory application which is “peripheral to the main hearing determining the outcome of the case” (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>at [58], citing <span class="font-italic">Jowitt’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Dictionary of English Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010)), “the entire subject matter of that originating summons is spent and there is nothing further for the court to deal with” once the application to administer pre-action interrogatories is disposed of (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In contrast with an application to administer pre-action interrogatories, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods</span> considered that a s 285 application is an interlocutory application. This was because “unlike that of an application under originating summons for leave to administer pre-action interrogatories, [it] is made in the <span class="font-italic">wider context of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ongoing </span><span class="font-italic">winding</span><span class="font-italic">-up proceedings</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Hence, while both pre-action interrogatories and s 285 applications seek information which may reveal potential causes of action against errant parties, s 285 applications are interlocutory in nature, as they operate <span class="font-italic">within</span> the winding-up proceedings, and the determination of a s 285 application does not therefore dispose of everything in the proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>at [32]–[34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The observations in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>are correct in so far as they relate to compulsory winding-up orders. As s 254 of the Act shows, a compulsory, or court-ordered winding-up order is granted at the order of the court. After the making of such an order for winding-up, a compulsory winding-up order only concludes when the court, on application of the liquidator, orders that the company be dissolved (ss 275 and 276 of the Act). Hence, compulsory winding-up proceedings only come to a close when the liquidator has shown, to the court’s satisfaction, that he has “realised all the property of the company or so much thereof as can in his opinion be realised…” (s 275 of the Act). Therefore, where the company is subject to a compulsory winding-up order, which was the type of winding-up order before the court in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods, </span>a s 285 application plainly operates “in the wider context of ongoing winding-up proceedings” (<span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In contrast, a voluntary winding-up is commenced upon the due resolution passed by the members of the company in a general meeting, without any need to initiate court proceedings (s 290 of the Act). The voluntary winding-up also comes to a close “[a]s soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound up” and the liquidator thereupon calls a meeting of the members or creditors, lodging a return of the meeting with the Registrar of Companies and the Official Receiver thereafter. Three months after the lodging of the return, the company is dissolved (s 308 of the Act). Plainly, unlike a compulsory winding-up order, a voluntary winding-up may take place <span class="font-italic">independently</span> of court proceedings, and the court’s supervision of the winding-up is only triggered when there is an application to the court through, for example, a s 285 application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Given the fundamental differences between a compulsory winding-up and a voluntary winding-up, it is clear that the Court in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>was only focused on a s 285 application made in the context of a compulsory winding-up application, which proceedings necessarily end in the courts. In contrast, in a creditors’ voluntary winding-up, court proceedings need not in fact be initiated, and the liquidation may come to an end <span class="font-italic">without </span>the need to initiate <span class="font-italic">any</span> proceedings. In other words, while a s 285 application in a compulsory winding-up application necessarily occurs <span class="font-italic">within</span> winding-up proceedings, a s 285 application in a voluntary winding-up occurs <span class="font-italic">independent</span><span class="font-italic">ly</span> of any<span class="font-italic"> </span>winding-up proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 This is reflected by the fact that while a s 285 application is made by way of a summons where there is an ongoing compulsory winding-up proceeding (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, Celestial Nutrifoods </span>at [11]), it is made by way of an originating summons when the company is being voluntarily wound up. This is not a distinction without a difference. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Hengwell</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v Thing Chiang Ching </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 84 at [5], “[a]n originating summons is an originating process. Like the writ of summons it prescribes the plaintiff’s cause of action and prays for judgments or orders, which in their nature (but subject to the avenues of appeal) are <span class="font-italic">determinative and final</span>.

This is because, like an application for pre-action interrogatories, which is also initiated by an originating summons, “[o]nce the application [is] determined, the entire subject matter of that originating summons [is] spent and there [is] nothing further for the court to deal with” (<span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Hence, I declare that the leave of the court is not required for the respective defendants to appeal against the Orders, which relate to s 285 applications made in the context of a creditors’ voluntary winding-up, rather than a compulsory winding-up order of the court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Even if leave is required, a question of importance is raised</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In any event, even if leave is indeed required, I find that the present matter raises a “question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage” (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16]).

A clarification in this regard would be to the public advantage, as liquidators appointed pursuant to a voluntary winding-up proceeding would be relieved from having to spend additional company funds (often of an ailing company) simply to resolve the narrow issue of whether leave ought to be sought for a disputed s 285 order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Hence, should leave be required, I grant leave for the respective defendants to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">case of error</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, I should add that I respectfully do not agree with counsel for Costank that leave should be granted to appeal against my decision in OS 420/2019 on the basis that there has been a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error (<span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew </span>at [16]). The present case differs from the case of <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan Yew</span>, where the Court of Appeal held that the Judge below had committed a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error. In that case, the plaintiff filed certain affidavits in proceedings against the defendant. At a press conference in Malaysia, the defendant raised certain statements in the plaintiff’s affidavits which caused anger in Malaysia. The plaintiff applied to delete the statements from his affidavits. The Judge allowed the application for deletion on the ground that the defendant had abused the process of the court by using the affidavits for a collateral purpose, and ordered costs against the defendant. The defendant applied to the same Judge for leave to appeal against the costs order but was unsuccessful. He then filed a motion for leave of court to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the costs order. The Court of Appeal granted the motion for leave to appeal, reasoning that an affidavit, once revealed in court, becomes a public record, such that the defendant was acting within the law in releasing the statements in the affidavits to the Malaysian press. On the face of it, the Judge had disregarded the nature of the affidavit, thereby resulting in the costs order which effectively rendered the defendant entirely responsible for all that had happened. Thus, a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error had been established, and leave to appeal against the award of costs was granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Orders made in the present case were the result of an application of established principles that were pronounced by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods</span>, in relation to s 285 applications. All parties had relied on the same authority, and it is unclear what, if any, <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error has been committed in this case. If anything, Costank’s disagreement relates to the scope of the Orders that were made, which counsel for Costank described as an “[u]nprecedented abuse of s 285” of the Act, which has the effect of “pushing the boundaries to a point that it has become completely oppressive and unacceptable”.

Hence, subject to the requirements that the liquidator must have some reasonable basis for his belief, and that the order granted by the court is not wholly unreasonable, unnecessary or oppressive to the person(s) concerned, the court has broad powers to grant orders under s 285 to assist the liquidator in the conduct of his statutory functions, which includes investigating into potential wrongdoings that were committed against the company (<span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods </span>at [41]–[43]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Furthermore, as explained in my oral judgment to OS 420/2019, on my review of the evidence, the plaintiffs have provided some reasonable basis for their belief that Costank can assist them in obtaining relevant information that are reasonably required:

In this regard, ascertaining whether there are discrepancies between the records kept by the respondents and those kept by the Company would be helpful and relevant. It would allow the liquidators to enquire into the period in which the alleged fraud took place and identify any fraudulent transactions. Seen in the context of the admission by Tan Sing Hwa, a director of the Company, that he had perpetrated or had been involved in fraud relating to the Company’s trades, the trading loops also do give rise to some concern. In so far as compliance with this order imposes a practical burden on Costank, this is merely one factor to be weighed at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I also made clear that the Orders made were not unreasonable in scope:

For example, in <span class="font-italic">Naseer</span><span class="font-italic"> Ahmad</span>, the plaintiff, who was the majority shareholder of the company at the hub of the dispute, sought leave of court to convene an inquorate meeting to pass a set of resolutions, which included removing the first defendant from his directorship in the company. The Court granted leave to convene the inquorate meeting. Counsel for the defendants then sought a stay of execution of the Judge’s order pending an appeal, arguing that there was a risk that the company’s assets would be dissipated by the plaintiff should the first defendant be removed from his directorship. Apart from finding that the first defendant had not shown that there was any real substance to his assertion of such risk, the Judge considered that a stay ought not to be granted given that the plaintiff had offered an undertaking that the company’s funds would not be drawn down, save to be used in the ordinary business expenses of the company, without the prior consent of the first defendant. Given the plaintiff’s undertaking, the grant of a stay was “unnecessary”: <span class="font-italic">Naseer</span><span class="font-italic"> Ahmad </span>at [105].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Celestial </span><span class="font-italic">Nutrifoods</span>, the appellants had applied for a stay of the Judge’s disclosure order. The Judge refused the application, which was subsequently also rejected by a single-judge of the Court of Appeal. Finally, a two-judge Court of Appeal granted the stay. Essential to this eventual grant of stay was an undertaking furnished by the appellants that time would not run for the intervening period between the date when the Judge’s order was made and the date when the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (should the appeal be dismissed). This undertaking was sufficient to meet the respondent’s contention that he could face time-bar issues in pursuing claims against the appellants if there was a delay in the disclosure of the requested documents.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stay of execution ought not to be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Considering the above principles, I am of the view that a stay of execution ought not to be granted in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In meeting the defendants’ assertion that the plaintiffs will not be able to “un-see” the documents once they have been disclosed, counsel for the plaintiffs have indicated that the plaintiffs are willing to undertake that they will not disseminate the documents disclosed pursuant to the Orders to any third parties without the court’s approval, pending the appeal.

In my view, these broad undertakings are sufficient to allay the concerns raised by the defendants. As for the time and effort that would be expended by the defendants in complying with the Orders, no evidence was provided as to why such cannot be compensated with an appropriate award of costs, should the defendants’ appeal against the Orders be successful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I am guided by the decision in <span class="font-italic">Akai Holdings Ltd (in </span><span class="font-italic">Compulsory Liq) &amp; others v Ho Wing On Christopher &amp; others </span>[2009] HKCU 542 (“<span class="font-italic">Akai Holdings</span>”). In that case, the first defendant sought a stay of execution of the disclosure order that had been sought by the plaintiff liquidators in the context of a Mareva injunction application.

</div> I do not find the difference to be material. As seen from the passage above, the Judge in <span class="font-italic">Akai Holdings </span>had declined to grant a stay upon balancing on the one hand the need to ensure that the first defendant’s appeal would not be rendered nugatory, and on the other hand the fact that the information would be disclosed to a limited number of persons, as well as the plaintiffs’ undertaking to return or destroy the information in the event of a successful appeal. The Judge had also considered that the disclosure order was necessary to “give the teeth which are critical to the [Mareva injunction]” (<span class="font-italic">Akai Holdings </span>at [56], citing <span class="font-italic">Motorola Credit Corporation v </span><span class="font-italic">Cem Cegiz Uzan </span>[2002] 2 All ER (Comm) 945). It was only on balancing these countervailing considerations that the Judge arrived at his conclusion that a stay of the disclosure orders ought not to be granted, in particular as any prejudice suffered by the first defendant in complying with the disclosure orders could be compensated in costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this case, the documents that will be released under the Orders will be disclosed to a restricted number of persons which include in the main the plaintiffs, as liquidators of the company, only. Further, given the plaintiffs’ undertaking not to disseminate the documents pending the conclusion of the appeal(s), the documents will not be disclosed to third parties, unless the court otherwise orders. The documents that are released will also have to be returned or destroyed should the defendants be successful in their appeals against the Orders, and any efforts expended by the defendants in complying with the Orders can thereafter be compensated with a costs order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the circumstances, while I am cognisant of the consideration that the defendant’s appeal ought not to be rendered nugatory, I find, in light of the above considerations, that a stay ought not to be granted. I thus decline to grant the stay of execution of the Orders pending disposition of the defendants’ appeals (if any). For good order, I have considered and accept in substance the undertakings proposed by the plaintiffs, which apply separately to each of the defendants’ appeal(s) (if any). I record the plaintiffs’ undertakings in the following terms:
