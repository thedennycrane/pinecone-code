Specifically, it concerns an arrangement whereby a liquidator assigns the causes of action of a company undergoing liquidation to a third party litigation funder. Similar arrangements have been approved by our courts (see <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard Energy Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 4 SLR 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span>”) in relation to the assignment of the fruits of a cause of action), and their advantages are immediately apparent from the perspective of liquidators, who would otherwise have to forego claims that a company might have because of a lack of funds (<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Re Movitor Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) v Sims </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">1996) 19 ACSR 440 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Re Movitor</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 444). But such arrangements also raise a host of concerns that strikes fundamentally at the liquidator’s duties to the court and to creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 How then should the court strike a balance between enabling liquidators to fully realise a company’s assets and preventing undue trafficking in litigation? Under what circumstances should the court approve such arrangements under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”)? These are the principal questions arising in this application under ss 273(3) and 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, which was brought by Affert Resources Pte Ltd (“the Company”) via its liquidators (“the Liquidators”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Company was placed under compulsory liquidation on 18 September 2017, pursuant to an application by one of its creditors, Solvadis Commodity Chemicals Gmbh (“Solvadis”).

He then held that s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) captures the sale of the proceeds from a company’s causes of action, and observed that the provision also includes the sale of a company’s causes of action (at [12(a)] and [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I agree with and adopt Chua JC’s observations. I note that <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> involved the sale of the <span class="font-italic">fruits</span> of a cause of action belonging to the company.

Chua JC’s observations are amply supported in the authorities demonstrating that a liquidator is statutorily empowered to assign a company’s causes of actions because they form part of its property (<span class="font-italic">Cant</span>, <span class="font-italic">In the matter of Novaline Pty Ltd (in liq) </span>[2011] FCA 898 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Novaline</span>”) at [17] and [21]; Edward Bailey &amp; Hugo Groves, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Insolvency: Law and Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 4th ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Corporate Insolvency</span>”) at paras 22.57 and 22.60). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 That being said, where a liquidator exercises his power under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to sell the company’s property, the subject-matter to be sold must be sufficiently identifiable (<span class="font-italic">Re Novaline</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]–[13]). If the subject-matter sought to be sold is insufficiently identified, the court cannot reasonably exercise its supervisory jurisdiction under s 272(3) of the Act over the liquidator’s exercise of its statutory power of sale. As <span class="font-italic">Re Novaline</span> makes clear, where causes of action are being sold, the liquidator must identify them with reference to <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, extant proceedings, the parties being claimed against, or the offending conduct (at [11]–[12]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 Applications for Court approval of assignments of causes of action are often made after proceedings have been issued.

</div> This is very wide, and the ambit of what was to be sold was not sufficiently identifiable. The Liquidators subsequently returned with a revised draft of the Assigned Causes of Action, whereby it sought to assign all causes of action pertaining to the receivables owed to the Company with reference to a defined list of third parties named under the list of Assigned Receivables. In my view, the revised Assigned Causes of Action is clear enough to identify the subject-matter of the assignment, and therefore satisfies the threshold of being sufficiently identifiable. For completeness, the (revised) clause setting out the Assigned Causes of Action provides as follows:

</div> It is to this issue that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the doctrine of maintenance and champerty applies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The definition of maintenance and champerty was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa and another v Ong Jane Rebecca </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 775 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa</span>”) at [23] (citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England </span>vol 9 (4th Ed) at para 400) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Maintenance may be defined as the giving of assistance or encouragement to one of the parties to litigation by a person who has neither an interest in the litigation nor any other motive recognised by the law as justifying his interference. Champerty is a particular kind of maintenance, namely maintenance of an action in consideration of a promise to give the maintainer a share in the proceeds or subject matter of the action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I agree with Chua JC in <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> that s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act is a statutory exception to the doctrine of maintenance and champerty. Accordingly, to determine whether a liquidator’s assignment of a cause of action infringes the doctrine of maintenance and champerty, the starting point is to determine the subject-matter of sale under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). If the sale or assignment falls within the liquidator’s statutory power of sale, then it follows that such sale is authorised by statute despite the rules as to maintenance and champerty (<span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> at [27]-–[29]).<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> To hold otherwise would be to frustrate the object of the legislation if the doctrine of maintenance</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> and champerty prevented a liquidator from discharging his statutory duty to realise the company’s assets to advantage, and from exercising his statutory powers of sale to pursue meritorious claims that might otherwise go unpursued (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Re Movitor</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at 444</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">-–445). </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In this connection, </span>I also agree with Chua JC in <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> (at [30]) that for the purposes of s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, it matters not whether the assignee stands to make a profit from the sale of a company’s property. Litigation funders would realistically and sensibly expect to be compensated for the risks that they take in funding an insolvent company’s litigation. To expect that litigation funders should not seek a profit is commercially unrealistic and would stifle the ability for insolvent companies to pursue meritorious claims and thereby prejudice creditors.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As Drummond J noted in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Re Movitor</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, agreements such as the one in the present case “will often serve a good public purpose” (at 444).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 That said, the liquidators’ powers to sell the company’s property is subject to the court’s control by virtue of s 272(3) of the Act, and the court should take into account various factors in determining whether to permit a liquidator to exercise its statutory powers under s 272(2). This includes the level of profit that a litigation funder may expect to earn, a matter that I will return to. At this juncture, it suffices to note that the assignment of causes of action under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is a statutory exception to the doctrine of maintenance and champerty. To that extent, that RV1 can expect to turn a profit from the Agreement does not preclude the approval of such an agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Before departing from this issue, I note that Jakhau contended that the doctrine of maintenance and champerty was also offended because RV1 is allegedly being funded by Oxford. I do not think that there is any merit in this contention. Putting aside the veracity of Jakhau’s contention <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> RV1 and Oxford, the commercial arrangement between the latter two is not before this court. It would thus be improper for me to make any findings as between the two entities, much less rely on their relationship to impugn the propriety of the Agreement, which is between the Company and RV1 (<span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa </span>at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To sum up, s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act permits liquidators to assign sufficiently identifiable causes of action to a third party for consideration. It is also a statutory exception to the doctrine of maintenance and champerty. In this case, the Assigned Property is sufficiently identifiable and falls within the ambit of s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). The Agreement therefore does not run afoul of the doctrine of maintenance and champerty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I should also add that what the Liquidators sought to sell (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Assigned Property) does not include causes of action that arise only in the event of a liquidation, and that can thus only be pursued by a liquidator pursuant to a statutory power conferred on him, such as the right to bring proceedings under avoidance law, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, transactions at an undervalue. It has been held that rights of action vesting solely in a liquidator of a company in liquidation cannot be assigned or sold to a third party (see <span class="font-italic">Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd </span>[1998] Ch 170 at 186–187 and <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 717 at [24]; see also <span class="font-italic">Manharlal Trikamdas Mody and another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1161 at [54]–[56], albeit in the context of bankruptcy). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Bona fides </span><span class="font-weight-bold">of the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factors to be considered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Section 272(3) of the Act provides that a liquidator’s power under s 272(2) is subject to the court’s control. In determining whether a liquidator’s exercise of its power under s 272(2) should be subject to the court’s intervention, the overarching consideration should be whether the liquidator, in exercising those powers, is acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I take as my starting point that the court does not readily interfere with a liquidator’s discretion (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Corporate Insolvency </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at para 4.38).

It is thus not proper for the court to intervene and substitute its own decision for that of the provisional liquidators. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 That the court does not readily interfere with a liquidator’s commercial decisions and exercise of its powers can also be found in the Australian authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Re Addstone Pte Ltd (in liq)</span> (1998) 83 FCR 583 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Addstone</span>”), the Federal Court of Australia considered s 477(2)(c) of the Corporations Law 1989 (Cth) (which is materially similar to s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act) in relation to the liquidator’s power to enter into transactions with a view to procuring funding for the conduct of certain proposed litigation on behalf of the companies under liquidation. Under the agreement in <span class="font-italic">Re Addstone</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the liquidator would obtain a loan facility from a bank to fund its legal and other expenses in pursuing various claims. The loan facility would be insured by the funder (in the event that the claims were unsuccessful) in return for the funder receiving a proportion of any successful recovery by the liquidator on the claims. In approving the proposed arrangement, the Federal Court held that its role was not to “second guess” the liquidator’s judgment and to substitute its own views. Instead, the question is whether the liquidator is acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in entering into such arrangements (at 594). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As should be immediately apparent, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Addstone</span> is consonant with the principle as set out in <span class="font-italic">Kumagai-Zenecon</span> that the court ought to be slow in interfering with a liquidator’s commercial decision where bad faith has not been established. <span class="font-italic">Re Addstone </span>has also been endorsed in subsequent cases including <span class="font-italic">Jones, Saker, Weaver and Stewart (Liquidators), in the matter of Great Southern Limited (in liq) (Receivers and Managers Appointed)</span> [2012] FCA 1072 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Great Southern</span>”) and more recently in <span class="font-italic">Re Van Der Velde</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Next, in ascertaining whether the liquidators have acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or in good faith, the Australian courts have enumerated a number of non-exhaustive and non-determinative factors to be taken into account (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Great Southern </span>at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Re Van Der Velde </span>at [15]), namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the nature and complexity of the matter and the risks involved in pursuing the claims;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the prospects of success of the proposed action;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the amount of costs likely to be incurred in the conduct of the action and the extent to which the funder is to contribute to the costs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the extent to which the funder will contribute towards the opponent’s costs in the event that the action is not successful or towards any order for security for costs; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, including the ability of the funder to meet its obligations;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the level of the funder’s premium;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the extent to which the liquidators have canvassed other funding options and consulted with the creditors of the company;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) the interests of the creditors and the effect that the funding agreement may have on the company’s creditors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) possible oppression to another party in the proceedings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) the extent to which the liquidators maintain control over the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I find that the above factors serve as a useful guide in determining the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of a liquidator’s exercise of its powers under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act.

I also add that the clause setting out the Assigned Causes of Action indicates that there are potential claims premised on causes of actions such as conspiracy and fraud (<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">see </span>[25] above). Such causes of actions can be complex and costly to investigate and pursue, which would be considerations in favour of approving the Agreement given that the Company does not have the resources to pursue any potential claims.

RV1 will therefore bear the costs of the recovery process. The Company will not have to bear any costs in the recovery process, unlike in the case where the fruits of a cause of action are sold to the litigation funder after such fruits have been recovered. Accordingly, there is no detriment to the Company in that it does not have to incur any costs in any recovery process which will be conducted by RV1. Further, in the event that any action pursued by RV1 is unsuccessful, RV1 would have to bear any adverse costs orders as it (and not the Company) would be a party to the action. In this regard, the Agreement expressly provides that RV1 cannot commence proceedings or enforcement or recovery actions in the Company’s name or join the Company as a party to any proceedings. I was satisfied that in this way, the Company would not be affected by any adverse costs orders arising from recovery actions undertaken by RV1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Circumstances surrounding the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Here, I consider the circumstances under which the Agreement was reached.

</div> Nevertheless, I bore in mind that any difficulty that RV1 encounters in its recovery actions is tempered by the fact that the Company may buy back any Assigned Receivables and Assigned Causes of Action for S$1 if RV1 fails to commence recovery within one year or six months, as the case may be. Hence, if RV1 does not pursue the Assigned Property for whatever reason, the Company is not completely shut out from so doing (assuming that it has the necessary resources to do so).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Level of funder’s premium</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Moving on to RV1’s premium, Jakhau also submitted that the Agreement ought to be disallowed on the basis that RV1 stood to make a “grossly excessive profit” from the Agreement.

</div> the UK and Australian courts have approved similar agreements under which the insolvent company was entitled to less than half of the recovered proceeds.  In <span class="font-italic">Buiscex Ltd and Another v Panfida Foods Ltd (in liq) </span>(1998) 28 ACSR 357, the Supreme Court of New South Wales approved a litigation funding agreement for the fruits of causes of action, under which the funder would fund investigations by the liquidators into the company’s affairs for a certain period and the funder would have an option to acquire 75% interest in the net amounts recovered on the company’s behalf in any cause of action brought on behalf of the company. Although the proposed agreement would give only 25% of the net return of any proceedings to the company, the court did not find this to be unreasonable. In <span class="font-italic">Ramsey v Hartley and others </span>[1977] 2 All ER 673, a cause of action was assigned to the funder with the assignor being entitled to 35% of the recovery proceeds. The English Court of Appeal accepted that the promise by the assignee to pay the assignor 35% of the net proceeds of the action was good valuable consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On our facts, the Company stood to gain 40% to 50% of whatever RV1 manages to recover.

Moreover, as I stated earlier, no other third party litigation funder has offered a better deal than the one captured in the Agreement. At the end of the day, there is no hard and fast rule on the appropriate level of the funder’s premium and all relevant factors must be considered holistically. In the circumstances, I did not think that the profit that RV1 stands to gain was a reason not to approve the Agreement.

Further, RV1 has a vested interest in ensuring that any recovery by litigation or otherwise would be properly conducted.

The Agreement provides that RV1 is to provide quarterly updates to the Liquidators, who are also entitled to seek updates on a more frequent basis. As stated earlier, the Agreement, as amended, also prevents RV1 from further assigning the Assigned Property. Additionally, if RV1 does not commence recovery action in relation to the Assigned Receivables or Assigned Causes of Action within the stipulated six months or one year respectively, the Liquidators have the option to buy back the Assigned Receivables or Assigned Causes of Action (as the case may be) for a nominal sum of $1.

</div> Put simply, any counterclaim brought by a third party against the Company in proceedings initiated by RV1 would be no different from a <span class="font-italic">claim</span> brought by a third party against the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I make a final observation on public policy considerations, which were briefly alluded to by Chua JC in <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard </span>at [46] in his discussion of the doctrine of maintenance and champerty, and of the circumstances under which assignments of bare causes of action (or of its fruits) will be struck down. As he noted, the relevant policy where assignments of bare causes of actions are concerned is “that of protecting the purity of justice and the interests of vulnerable litigants”. In my view, neither of these interests are contravened by the Agreement, and the Company is by no means a vulnerable litigant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In any event, the court exercises a measure of control over such arrangements by considering a number of factors in determining whether liquidators have acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. In this regard, I have also ensured that safeguards were put in place in the Agreement to protect the interests of the Company’s creditors and after taking into consideration Jakhau’s concerns. This includes the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Agreement cannot be further assigned to another party by RV1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) RV1 cannot commence proceedings in the Company’s name or join the Company as a party to any proceedings. This also ensures that the Company is not subject to unnecessary risks and expenses in RV1’s recovery process.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) RV1 may only enter into a settlement agreement with third parties (in any recovery action) on the recommendation of legal advisors. This also ensures that a certain level of check is undertaken by lawyers in regard to any settlement, as some of the benefit is ultimately to accrue to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Any recovery proceeds, which the Company is entitled to, is paid over to the Company within a certain period. This also ensures that the Company will receive any fruits of a recovery action in a timely manner.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Company will have the option to repurchase the Assigned Property (at a nominal sum) if RV1 is not sufficiently expeditious in its conduct of the recovery actions. This enables the Company (assuming it has the resources) to take recovery action if RV1 does not do so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) To enable the Liquidators to monitor RV1’s recovery actions, RV1 has to provide quarterly updates to the Liquidators, who are also entitled to seek updates on a more frequent basis.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The Agreement cannot be modified or amended without the approval of the creditors or the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Additionally, the Liquidators have also agreed to provide the creditors updates on the progress of RV1’s recovery efforts on a quarterly basis, as per Jakhau’s request, and I thus ordered accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the round, agreements such as the present one must be balanced against the reality that an insolvent company may not have the ability to pursue meritorious claims on its own and recover potentially substantial assets which are for the ultimate benefit of its creditors. Indeed, in the present case, the Company stated that it did not have the resources to do so, and the creditors that objected to the application have similarly not provided any form of positive assistance in resources to pursue such recovery (unlike in the case of <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> where the shareholders of the Company were the assignees). Additionally, despite the amount of time and notice given by the Liquidators, the creditors have also not been able to procure another funder that was willing to provide a concrete alternative proposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The simple point is this: with the assignment, the Company stands to gain immediately with a S$50,000 upfront payment; without the assignment, the Company stands to gain nothing at all. At the end of the day, to prevent such arrangements would shut out a lot of insolvent companies from pursuing legal remedies against its debtors (unless the contributories or creditors are prepared to fund such recovery process). Where a third party litigation funder is prepared to step in, one would obviously expect it to take a share in the recovery process for the risks that it takes. As I note above <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at </span>[29] and [49]–[51], any profit that a third party funder may expect to make from such arrangements does not detract from the purity of justice if such profits do not come at the company’s expense. In my view, allowing such arrangements serves a public interest so long as they are executed and negotiated in good faith. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard</span> at [46], it is “undeniable that litigation funding has an especially useful role to play in insolvency situations”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the foregoing reasons, I approved the Agreement. With regard to costs, I ordered that they were to be borne by RV1 as provided for under the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Wee and Darrell Low (Yusarn Audrey) for the liquidators of Affert Resources Pte Ltd;<br/>Dominic Chan and Daniel Ng (Characterist LLC) for Solvadis Commodity Chemicals Gmbh;<br/>Joseph Lopez, Vanathi Eliora Ray and Intan Krishanty (Joseph Lopez LLP) for Jakhau Salt Company Pte Ltd; and</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Ee Yang and Charis Wong (Covenant Chambers LLC) for Recovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
