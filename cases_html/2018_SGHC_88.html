For Trillion, while there was no exit mechanism, she ought to have considered WKY’s offer to purchase her shares at fair value. Therefore, the applications were dismissed. The last issue, which was whether an order under s254(2A) of the Companies Act would be a more equitable remedy, fell away after consideration of the first two issues, as the basis for the Court’s intervention was not established.

Thus, references to “quasi-partnerships” can be found in cases where the Court’s just and equitable jurisdiction was invoked.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chow K</span><span class="font-italic">wok Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi and another</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow Kwo</span><span class="font-italic">k Chuen</span>”) held at [17] that the concept of “just and equitable” is “a dynamic one” which should not be circumscribed in scope by reference to case law, and identified at [18] the following situations which could also constitute sufficient factual bases to establish just and equitable causes:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) where the main object of the company cannot be achieved or has been departed from;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) where the company’s business has been carried on in a fraudulent manner;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) where the company is really no more than an incorporated partnership and members can no longer work in association with one another;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) where minority members have been oppressed or treated unfairly by controlling members and have justifiably lost confidence in the management of the company; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) where the petitioner has been deliberately excluded from the management of the company in contravention of an understanding that he will be allowed to participate in managing the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Fundamental to the Court’s exercise of its broad discretion, nevertheless, is caution, because the Court’s order would allow the applicant to be released from his obligation to comply with the framework provided by a company’s memorandum and articles: <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span> at [19]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I turn to Ms Ma’s contentions on the family company arguments, the mismanagement contentions, and the loss of substratum argument with this context in mind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The family company arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was there a quasi-partnership?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It was common ground that a quasi-partnership – “an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual confidence” – may be wound up on the just and equitable ground if the relationship of trust and confidence between its shareholders has broken down: see <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping </span>at [85]; [91]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 <span class="font-italic">Was there, however, a quasi-partnership?</span> It was not disputed that one existed between the three Wong brothers when WKN managed the Companies. <span class="font-italic">WKN </span><span class="font-italic">ceased to do so from March 2011, nevertheless.</span> Crucially, Ms Ma has not participated in the management of these Companies from their inception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span> is particularly pertinent. In that case, Mdm Ting, in both her personal capacity and her capacity as executor of her late husband’s (“Mr Chng”) estate, applied to wind up the defendant companies, which had been started and run by Mr Chng and his partner, one Mr Chan. After Mr Chng’s death, Mdm Ting and Mr Chan could not agree over the management of the companies, and she applied for them to be wound up on the just and equitable ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Several observations made by the Court of Appeal are instructive. First, the death of a shareholder in a quasi-partnership does not automatically justify winding up the company (at [87] and [90]). Second, “[r]ights under a quasi-partnership are, generally, not transmissible and would not continue to bind the remaining quasi-partners after a partner’s death”, unless this was expressly provided for in the company’s constitution (at [96]). The holding of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">Cheung Shu Chuen v Lee Der Industrial Co</span> [2009] HKCU 478 at [24] that “a quasi-partnership was a <span class="font-italic">personal</span> relationship that did not survive death [emphasis added]” was cited with approval at [93] and [96]. Third, in response to Mdm Ting’s submission that “the absence of trust and confidence between the shareholders … removes the basis or substratum of the [c]ompanies such that there are just and equitable grounds for winding up”, the Court held, at [100]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Likewise, Mdm Ting cannot rely on the fact that the trust and confidence between shareholders no longer exists. While trust and confidence formed the basis of the incorporation of the Companies there is no reason to hold that the absence of mutual trust and confidence among the present shareholders justifies a just and equitable winding up. Mutual trust and confidence existed between Chan and Chng – but should the court expect the same trust and confidence to exist between Chan and Mdm Ting, and, on the basis that it does not, wind up the Companies? <span class="font-italic">It is, in our view, irrelevant that presently there does not exist any mutual trust and confidence between Chan and Mdm Ting since such relationship, if it ever existed, had nothing to do with the incorporation and running of the Companies</span>. Neither Company was ever based on mutual trust and confidence between Chan and Mdm Ting.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my judgment, this analysis informs the approach that must be taken here. The relationship of trust and confidence existed only between the Wong brothers. It did not extend to Ms Ma’s family. It is therefore irrelevant that there was no longer any trust and confidence between the extended families.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Lin Choo Mee v Tat Leong Development (Pte) Ltd and Others and Other Matters</span> [2015] SGHC 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Lin Choo Mee</span>”), relied upon by Ms Ma, were of no assistance to her case. <span class="font-italic">Chow K</span><span class="font-italic">wok Chuen</span> involved three brothers who were co-directors of three family companies set up by their late father. In <span class="font-italic">Lin Choo Mee</span>, the plaintiff, who applied to wind up three family companies on the just and equitable ground, was similarly a director of the three defendant companies and was “always meant to have a management role” in them. Thus, these two cases involved plaintiffs who had been actively running the companies sought to be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In contrast, prior to WKN’s death, aside from WKN, no member of his family had at any time been a shareholder of the Companies; neither had any member of WKN’s family been involved in the management of the Companies.

Clauses 4d–f provide that the shares of the Companies, as part of his “worldwide assets”, are bequeathed to CIMB Commerce Trustee Berhad to be held on trust for the benefit of Ms Ma, his children Neil and Mimi Wong, and the beneficiaries of various trusts. With this trust arrangement, the beneficiaries would obtain the value of any assets held by the Companies at the time the directors of such Companies considered appropriate.

</div> The discrepancy was due to the omission of this particular debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In respect of Double Ace’s debt of $138,809.55 owed to Rayley, I make a slight diversion to explain that Ms Ma complained that this debt did not appear in any of the financial statements, and took issue with Mr Tan’s stated ignorance as to how the debt arose. As explained above, the sum of $138,809.55 is likely part of the larger debt of $1,028,979.55, which appears in the company’s financial statements dated 30 September 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Ms Ma also referred to the Trillion’s financial statements, which indicated that the company’s related-party debts increased from $995,907 in 2015 to $1,028,979 in 2016, a sum of $33,072. As stated above, the sum of $1,028,979 was supposedly rent owed by Double Ace to Trillion. Somewhat inconsistently, Mr Tan stated on affidavit that rent was $5,000 a month, or $60,000 a year. Ms Ma queries that if the sum of $1,028,979 was rent owed, the difference in the amount owing between 2015 and 2016 should be $60,000 and not $33,072. Accordingly, that sum could not have been rent owed to Trillion.

It is not unusual for directors to advance loans to their companies, especially where the company in question, like Double Ace, holds family assets. The quantum of the loan is also reasonable, taking into account the expenses of the company as reflected in the financial statements, which Ms Ma did not object to at the annual general meetings. Even if the statements would have been approved over her objections, I nevertheless find it strange that Ms Ma had done absolutely nothing to record her disapproval or reserve her rights, given the seriousness of her allegations. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ms Ma also highlighted that the company’s 2015 financial statements state that the company owed $1,095,907 to related parties, but none to directors. However, its 2016 financial statements state that it owed $100,000 to a director, and $995,907 to related parties. Ms Ma concluded from this that WKY had “carved out” the sum of $100,000 for himself.

Hence, Double Ace should be wound up. In reply, the contributories submitted that that Double Ace is obtaining rent from a company called “Hallaway”, which is permitted under the company’s constitution.

</div> Secondly, after she filed the application, the contributories were willing to wind up the company. Their condition that the OR be appointed liquidator was a sensible course given that this company was not a going concern. Furthermore, as I will explain below, Faxlink’s articles contained an exit mechanism which Ms Ma could have used. As she has chosen not to, it should be left to those charged with the management of Faxlink to decide how best to deal with its demise in the most cost efficient way.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presence of exit mechanisms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I have explained, thus far, why I found no commercial unfairness on the facts. <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span> at [107] makes clear that, even where unfairness is established, exit mechanisms are relevant in assessing whether the Court should intervene. In this exercise, the focus is on the terms of the separation, such as who should buy out whom, and the terms of the buy-out. Exceptions arise where the shareholder has a legitimate expectation to have his shares valued in another way than that provided, where impropriety has affected the value of the shares, or where the method of valuation provided was arbitrary. Where no attempt has been made to invoke the share buy-out mechanism in the company’s articles, unfairness is unlikely to be established. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Double Ace and Faxlink</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The exit mechanism of Double Ace, at article 27 of the Articles of Association,

The transferor is entitled to cancel the sale after being informed of the certified fair price. Otherwise, the company will give notice to the other members and invite them to purchase those shares.

As with Double Ace, any dispute as to the price of the shares will be resolved by the auditor of the company. I should also point out here that clauses which leave the determination of fair value to auditors are reasonable and commonplace: <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span> at [114]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Ms Ma contended in response that the mismanagement contentions made it impossible for a fair valuation to be obtained.

Notwithstanding this deficiency in Trillion’s articles, WKY offered, in his affidavits dated 12 October 2017, to purchase Ms Ma’s shares in the Companies at fair value (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by fixing the price of her shares through a joint independent valuer, if not agreed).

In <span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phi</span><span class="font-italic">llips</span>, where the majority shareholder offered to buy out the minority shareholder, Lord Hoffmann made the same point at 1107C: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But the unfairness does not lie in the exclusion alone but in exclusion without a reasonable offer. If the respondent to a petition has plainly made a reasonable offer, then the exclusion as such will not be unfairly prejudicial and he will be entitled to have the petition struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lord Hoffmann listed (at 1107D–1108B) various criteria to determine if an offer was a reasonable one. The first three – that the value not be discounted, that it be set by a competent expert and determined by that expert as an expert – were made out on WKY’s offer. The last two, that parties ought to have equality of information relevant to the valuation and to be reasonable on the issue of costs (in that case, in the context of the timing of the offer), did not arise for consideration because Ms Ma dismissed the offer out of hand. Even if unfairness was made out, which it was not, it would have been incumbent upon Ms Ma to engage the contributories on the terms of an offer that was on its face reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contributories’ request in the alternative for buy-out </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, even when the conditions for winding up are satisfied, the Court may order that the plaintiff’s shares be bought out under s 254(2A) of the Companies Act instead, if it considers this outcome to be more equitable. Relevant considerations include whether the company is viable and profitable, and the inquiry may involve a comparison of the consequences for the parties in the event of a winding up as opposed to a buy-out: <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span> at [79].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The contributories pointed out that an <span class="font-italic">en bloc</span> sale of Shenton House was imminent, and a premature winding up would in all likelihood lead to a lower sale price than the $750,000 and $2,162,282.70 envisaged for the properties. Absent mismanagement, such a result would unduly prejudice WKY, a creditor of these two companies.

</div> The beneficiaries of the estate might also lose the opportunity to fully realise their share of the Companies’ assets, as a market valuation will likely be higher than a liquidator-actuated sale of the assets.
