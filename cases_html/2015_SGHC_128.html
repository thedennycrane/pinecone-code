<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal has at its centre the
                                        issue of the ownership of copyright in photographs taken of
                                        the bride and groom, both before and on the wedding day.
                                        Such issues may be far from the minds of most couples
                                        marrying, but as in many instances, the law intrudes when
                                        least expected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant, who ran a business
                                        providing wedding services, appealed against the decision of
                                        the trial judge awarding the Respondent, her client, damages
                                        and an injunction for breach of copyright in pre-wedding and
                                        wedding photographs of the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Having heard the arguments of the
                                        parties, and having considered the evidence, I dismiss most
                                        of the appeal, save that I find that the copyright in the
                                        wedding photographs was not shown to be vested in the
                                        Respondent. The amount of damages awarded by the trial judge
                                        is therefore reduced. Additionally, I discharge the
                                        injunction against the further use of the photographs by the
                                        Appellant as there is little risk of her using the
                                        Respondent’s pre-wedding photographs in
                                future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent, who is a singer and
                                        actress, decided in 2009 to get married to her fiancé, Derek
                                        Baram (“Baram”). The couple chose 29 December
                                        2009 as the date of their wedding. As part of the
                                        preparations for the event, the Respondent made inquiries at
                                        the wedding boutique run by the Appellant. On 2 September
                                        2009, the Respondent engaged the Appellant to provide rental
                                        of custom made gowns and suits, flower arrangements,
                                        photography and video-taping service on her wedding day. On
                                        2 October 2009, after visiting the Appellant’s
                                        premises, the Respondent and Baram decided that they would
                                        buy suits for the latter, and not rent them from the
                                        Appellant. They did so because they were of the view that
                                        the suits were not satisfactorily tailor-made to fit
                                        Baram.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 18 October 2009, when the
                                        Respondent collected six gowns for a pre-wedding photo-shoot
                                        in London, she signed a form (“the Collection
                                        Form”). That form, aside from listing the gowns she
                                        collected, also stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘Sponsor for Photoshoot Rental FOC Dry cleaning
                                                charge in return for CD photos as sample
                                                book’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The circumstances of the signing of the
                                                Collection Form as well as the effect of the words
                                                stated therein were disputed by the
                                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the end of October 2009, the
                                        Respondent had a photo-shoot in London. She used gowns
                                        supplied by the Appellant. Photographs from this shoot
                                        (“the pre-wedding photographs”), which were
                                        taken by Ivy Lam (“the first photographer”),
                                        were handed over by the Respondent to the Appellant in a
                                        DVD. The circumstances in which these photographs were
                                        handed over were disputed. The Respondent claimed that the
                                        photographs were only for the Appellant’s personal
                                        viewing. The Appellant alleged that the photographs were
                                        given pursuant to an agreement entered between the two of
                                        them, allowing the Appellant to use these photographs in
                                        marketing her business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As it was, on the day of the
                                        wedding, photographs (“the wedding day
                                        photographs”) were taken of the event by a free-lance
                                        photographer (“the second
                                        photographer”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subsequently, the Respondent
                                        discovered the use by the Appellant of both sets of
                                        photographs. The Respondent came to know that there was a
                                        coffee table book publicly displayed at the
                                        Appellant’s business containing the wedding day
                                        photographs. The pre-wedding photographs were also used by
                                        the Appellant at wedding exhibitions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant asserted that she was
                                        entitled to use the photographs. In respect of the London
                                        photo-shoot, the Appellant had been prevailed upon by the
                                        Respondent to sponsor the latter’s photo-shoot in
                                        London <em>ie</em>. in exchange for the
                                        use of the photographs. As for the actual wedding day
                                        photographs, the Appellant argued that the copyright had not
                                        been vested in the Respondent. It should be noted that these
                                        photographs were not in fact used for marketing by the
                                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision of the trial judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trial judge found in favour of
                                        the Respondent. The Respondent had indeed commissioned the
                                        pre-wedding photographs. While it was disputed by the
                                        Appellant, the trial judge found that there was sufficient
                                        evidence to conclude that the Respondent had arranged and
                                        finalised the engagement of the first photographer. In any
                                        event, there was at least a joint commissioning by both the
                                        Respondent and Baram. It was sufficient for one of one of
                                        several co-owners to proceed against the infringer of
                                        copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As to the allegation of an
                                        agreement contained in the Collection Form, the trial judge
                                        found that there was no agreement between the parties. The
                                        sponsorship deal as alleged by the Appellant was inherently
                                        improbable in light of the status of the Respondent as a
                                        celebrity in Hong Kong and the value of the rental.
                                        Furthermore, the fact that the agreement was captured in a
                                        collection form, in the form of a few words, pointed against
                                        the Respondent knowingly entering into the alleged
                                        agreement. There was evidence that the Appellant intended to
                                        benefit from the Respondent’s status as a celebrity.
                                        On the facts of the case, it was likely that the gowns were
                                        provided as compensation for the three men’s suits
                                        which were not taken up by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The wedding day photographs were
                                        found by the judge to have been commissioned by the
                                        Respondent, though the Appellant had engaged the actual
                                        photographer. The copyright was vested in the Respondent
                                        under s 30(5) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed)
                                        (“the Act”) as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The judge ordered statutory
                                        damages of a total of $44,500 for the infringement of the
                                        Respondent’s copyright in the photographs. Firstly, in
                                        respect of the pre-wedding photographs, the trial judge
                                        considered that statutory damages of $1,500 for each item
                                        infringed was appropriate in light of the various
                                        considerations in the case. There were 29 infringements of
                                        the pre-wedding photographs, giving a sub-total of $43,500.
                                        As for the infringement in respect of the wedding day
                                        photographs, as there was no real exploitation, the trial
                                        judge awarded a sum of $1,000. These two figures thus added
                                        up to $44,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The trial judge additionally
                                        granted an injunction to restrain the Appellant’s
                                        infringement of the Respondent’s
                                copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appellant’s case on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the appeal, the Appellant
                                        argued that the Respondent had not shown that she owned the
                                        copyright in the photographs. Her evidence was inconsistent.
                                        The Appellant further argued that, in any event, the
                                        evidence from the first photographer showed that she had
                                        assigned the copyright to the Respondent. Any such purported
                                        assignment was not in compliance with s 194 of the Act.
                                        Additionally, on the facts, there is no basis to conclude
                                        that the photographer was commissioned by the Respondent. In
                                        any event, a binding agreement was formed through the
                                        contract contained in the Collection Form, under which the
                                        Respondent gave a licence to the Appellant to use these
                                        photographs. The trial judge had erred in finding that the
                                        contract was against the inherent probabilities. As for the
                                        copyright in the wedding day photographs, this was not held
                                        by the Respondent either. The Appellant was not acting as an
                                        agent of the Respondent in engaging the second photographer.
                                        Neither was the second photographer an employee of the
                                        Appellant – he was an independent contractor. The
                                        injunction should also be discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s case on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Respondent contended that the
                                        evidence was clear that she commissioned the photographs
                                        taken at the pre-wedding photo shoot. As for the photographs
                                        taken on the wedding day, the Appellant acted as the
                                        Respondent’s agent in engaging the photographer. The
                                        Respondent thus commissioned these photographs as well.
                                        There was also no agreement in the Collection Form for the
                                        Respondent to grant the Appellant a licence for the use of
                                        the photographs. The injunction should remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I am satisfied that the Respondent
                                        had the copyright in the pre-wedding photographs and that
                                        there was no agreement licensing the use of these
                                        photographs to the Appellant. I dismiss the appeal as
                                        regards this part of the trial judge’s decision.
                                        However, I find that the copyright in the photographs on the
                                        wedding day did not vest in the Respondent. She thus had no
                                        standing to proceed against the Appellant for infringement
                                        of the copyright in these photographs. I also find that the
                                        injunction awarded by the trial judge against the Appellant
                                        should be discharged as there is little or no risk at this
                                        time of the Appellant’s continued use of the
                                        pre-wedding photographs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I note that no arguments were made
                                        on appeal on whether the Appellant’s acts constituted
                                        an infringement of copyright under the law, and no issue was
                                        also taken with the quantification of the damages made by
                                        the trial judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The decision thus turned on the
                                        following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the ownership of
                                                copyright in the pre-wedding
                                        photographs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether a contract to licence the
                                                pre-wedding photographs was formed;
                                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     the ownership of copyright in the wedding day
                                                photographs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ownership of copyright in the pre-wedding
                                photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The question here is whether the
                                        Respondent had commissioned the pre-wedding photographs. I
                                        am satisfied that the Respondent has made out her case, as
                                        was accepted by the trial judge, that these photographs were
                                        indeed commissioned by her by the operation of s 30(5) of
                                        the Act. At the very least, as the trial judge found, the
                                        photographs were commissioned by both the Respondent and
                                        Baram. If so it was sufficient for one of them, <em>ie</em>, the Respondent, to pursue an
                                        action for an infringement of copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on commissioning </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The present appeal did not engage
                                        issues regarding the law on the commissioning of works,
                                        which is clear. Section 30(5) of the Act has not attracted
                                        much judicial attention in Singapore. That section reads, as
                                        relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    a person makes, for valuable
                                                  consideration, an agreement with another person
                                                  for the taking of a photograph … by the
                                                  other person; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the work is made in pursuance
                                                  of the agreement,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the first mentioned person shall be entitled to any
                                                copyright subsisting in the work by virtue of this
                                                Part, except that if the work is required for any
                                                particular purpose, that purpose shall be
                                                communicated to that other person and that other
                                                person shall be entitled to restrain the doing,
                                                otherwise than for that particular purpose, of any
                                                act comprised in the copyright in the work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus, under s 30(5), a person who commissions
                                                another to take a photograph is entitled to the
                                                copyright in such photograph. Otherwise, by virtue
                                                of s 30(1), copyright is normally vested in the
                                                author of the work. An exception also arises under s
                                                30(3), which provides that the operation of s 30(5)
                                                can be excluded or modified by
                                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In this case, therefore, the
                                        question is whether the facts do establish that the first
                                        photographer was commissioned by the
                                Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Findings of facts in relation to the pre-wedding day
                                photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The trial judge found that the
                                        photographs were in fact commissioned by the Respondent. I
                                        found nothing to cause me to disturb his findings. The trial
                                        judge accepted the evidence of the first photographer that
                                        she had spoken to and reached an agreement with the
                                        Respondent, as well as her explanation with respect to
                                        Baram’s role in arranging the trip to London for her.
                                        The trial judge found that Baram had taken the lead in the
                                        arrangements and payment as he was familiar with London. I
                                        saw nothing that called for these findings to be
                                        disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Appellant contended that the
                                        evidence pointed against this. There were three main factual
                                        contentions made by the Appellant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     the first
                                                photographer transferred the copyright in the
                                                pre-wedding photographs to the
                                        Respondent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     the pre-wedding photographs were in
                                                fact commissioned by Baram, not the Respondent;
                                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent was inconsistent as to
                                                what had transpired in respect of the pre-wedding
                                                photographs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Alleged transfer of copyright by the first
                                photographer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Appellant argued that the
                                        evidence of the first photographer was that she had given
                                        the copyright to the Respondent. This, the Appellant said,
                                        showed that what was intended was an assignment of copyright
                                        by the maker of the works. The Appellant argued that there
                                        was no proper assignment as required by law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, this makes too much of
                                        the words used by the first photographer, a lay person.
                                        While the language used by the witnesses was indeed not
                                        precise, the distinctions between the terms
                                        “giving”, “assigning” and
                                        “being commissioned” may not be apparent or
                                        live in the mind of a layperson, even someone who is
                                        actively involved in creating works on a daily basis. What
                                        matters is the legal characterisation that may be attributed
                                        when all the facts and circumstances are looked at. The
                                        first photographer did say when questioned by counsel for
                                        the Appellant that she gave full copyright to the
                                        Respondent. However, it is clear from the context that when
                                        this occurred, this was part of a general discussion between
                                        the first photographer and the Respondent.
                                        “Giving” the copyright in this context did not
                                        signify an actual assignment, but rather that it was not
                                        disputed that the copyright would reside in the Respondent
                                        from the very beginning. The first photographer was clear
                                        that the copyright was with the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Additionally, the Appellant
                                        contended that the testimony from the Respondent showed that
                                        she did not regard herself as having commissioned the first
                                        photographer. It is true that there is no direct statement
                                        by the Respondent that she “commissioned” the
                                        first photographer. Had there been such a statement, this
                                        issue would not have been a live one. Again, in the context
                                        of discussions between laypersons, it is not surprising that
                                        there is no such statement. The testimony of the Respondent
                                        did show that she regarded herself as being the one who
                                        engaged the first photographer, and that shows on the facts
                                        that it was the Respondent who commissioned the first
                                        photographer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Alleged commission by Baram</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Appellant also attempted to
                                        show that because Baram had paid for the flights and
                                        accommodation of the first photographer, he was the one who
                                        had commissioned the first photographer As noted by the
                                        trial judge, the first photographer gave evidence that she
                                        had been the Respondent’s friend for a number of
                                        years, and the Respondent was responsible for most of the
                                        wedding arrangements. Taken as a whole, it is more probable
                                        than not that the Respondent was the one who commissioned by
                                        the Respondent. Again, as found by the trial judge, Baram
                                        would not have made the arrangements he did but for the fact
                                        that the Respondent had commissioned the first photographer.
                                        I accept this conclusion reached by the trial
                                judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Appellant attacked the
                                        credibility of Baram, particularly his being called late in
                                        the day to give evidence orally at trial. However, while
                                        this would not have been the best way for the evidence to be
                                        introduced, I do not think it affected Baram’s credit
                                        or credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Alleged inconsistencies in the evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant has made much of
                                        supposed inconsistencies in the evidence, particularly of
                                        the Respondent. Some of these alleged inconsistencies
                                        related to the dealings with the first photographer. As
                                        noted above, I did not find however that any of these
                                        inconsistencies could be taken to be anything more than an
                                        expression of the understanding of a lay person of what the
                                        legal arrangements were. What the court has to determine
                                        ultimately is what legal character and legal impact should
                                        follow from what these parties did regardless of how they
                                        may describe it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The trial judge having accepted
                                        that the evidence pointed to the Respondent commissioning
                                        the pre-wedding photographs, and there being nothing before
                                        me to conclude that the trial judge was in error, I decline
                                        to disturb his findings. It follows then that the Respondent
                                        had commissioned the first photographer to take the
                                        pre-wedding photographs, and therefore she was entitled to
                                        the copyright under s 30(5) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ability of one of several co-owners to sue for
                                infringement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The trial judge found that even if
                                        copyright was jointly held by the Respondent and Baram,
                                        either of them singly may sue for infringement, citing
                                        George Wei, <em>The Law of Copyright in
                                                Singapore</em> (SNP Editions, 2nd Ed, 2000) at

                                        Millet J (as he then was) in the case (at 93–94). The
                                        relevant paragraph of Millet J’s judgment
                                        reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that one joint owner cannot grant an
                                                exclusive licence without the consent of the other
                                                owner or owners. Even if it were possible for one
                                                co-owner to grant a licence without the consent of
                                                the others, such a licence could not possibly be an
                                                exclusive licence, since he would not be able,
                                                without the consent of the others, to exclude the
                                                others or their licensees. Accordingly, it is
                                                self-evident that an exclusive licence can be
                                                granted only by all co-owners. A single co-owner
                                                can, of course, sue to restrain infringement
                                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>That last sentence is the basis of the
                                                footnote. The relevant authorities were not cited by
                                                Millet J, but it is likely that one of the cases he
                                                had in mind was probably <em>Lauri v
                                                  Renad</em> [1892] 3 Ch D
                                402</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In that case, Kekewich J adopted
                                        the reasoning of counsel for the plaintiff in that case,
                                        that one co-owner may be able to sue to prevent interference
                                        with the rights of the co-owners by a stranger. This
                                        position was not doubted on appeal in that case. The analogy
                                        accepted by Kekewich J was founded on an action for trespass
                                        by tenants-in-common of land. In the earlier decision of
                                                <em>Powell v Head</em> (1879)
                                        12 Ch D 686, Jessel MR stated that a part-owner could not
                                        lend or deal with the entirety of the copyright without the
                                        authority of the other part-owners. Kekewich J noted that
                                        such a proposition went against the ability of one co-owner
                                        to maintain an action on his own, but was in the end
                                        persuaded by the analogy put to him, and did not think that
                                        the plaintiff’s action should be defeated on that
                                        ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     While the English cases were
                                        concerned with English legislation, the issue of who had
                                        standing to sue was decided on general principles of
                                        property law and these principles are applicable in the
                                        local context and under the Act. I see nothing in the Act
                                        which militates against the adoption of the same position in
                                        Singapore. As against a stranger or third party, any of the
                                        co-owners of copyright must be able to sue without having to
                                        join the other co-owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In any event, the other co-owner,
                                        Baram, was a witness for the Respondent. Given his support
                                        for the Respondent’s position, the only thing lacking
                                        in the present case was the formal joinder of Baram. It is
                                        highly doubtful, I think, that in these circumstances the
                                        failure to join Baram in the proceedings should prove fatal
                                        to the Respondent’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The existence of a contract to licence the use of the
                                photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The next issue that was raised was
                                        that the Appellant had been given a licence to make use of
                                        the pre-wedding photographs. This contract was supposed to
                                        have been captured in the Collection Form. The Collection
                                        Form contained the following handwritten note</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sponsor for Photoshoot Rental FOC Dry cleaning charge
                                                in return for CD photos as sample book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellant argued that the
                                        Collection Form captured an agreement that the Appellant was
                                        sponsoring the pre-wedding photo-shoot in London, giving
                                        free rental of gowns, but with dry-cleaning charges
                                        applying, for which the Appellant would receive a compact
                                        disc of photographs which could be used by the Appellant as
                                        marketing samples for her boutique business. It was said
                                        that the Appellant did receive a DVD containing photographs
                                        from the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Respondent argued that it was
                                        not believable that the Respondent would have given a
                                        sponsorship agreement on a form contract meant to record the
                                        collection of the gowns. It was contended that the
                                        Respondent was experienced, knowing how endorsement
                                        contracts were drafted, and would not grant a licence
                                        without the involvement of her agent. There was no such
                                        agreement, and the words were added without the
                                        Respondent’s knowledge. The Respondent had not noticed
                                        the added words when she took her copy of the form. Even the
                                        allegation of the agreement between the parties which was
                                        captured in the Collection Form was made only at trial and
                                        was an afterthought. Furthermore, it was the intention of
                                        the Respondent to keep her wedding private. The evidence
                                        from another wedding boutique showed that an equivalent
                                        package would not be worth anywhere as much as the $10,000
                                        claimed by the Appellant. There was no certainty in the
                                        terms added, indicating there was no agreement between the
                                        parties. In any event, even if there was a contract, the
                                        term had to be read against the Appellant, and could not be
                                        interpreted as allowing the use for marketing. The DVD was
                                        given only to allow the Appellant to view the photographs
                                        for her own use. And even if there was an agreement, it had
                                        been terminated by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I am satisfied that no contract
                                        was in fact formed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Formation of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is highly doubtful that the
                                        contract as alleged by the Appellant was in fact formed. All
                                        that the Collection Form had covered was the collection of
                                        the gown, and it was nothing more than a documentary record
                                        of the collection of the gowns and related matters. The
                                        contract governing the relationship between the parties was
                                        what was agreed to previously between them, entered into on
                                        or about the 2 September 2009. This contract was evidenced
                                        by an invoice listing out a contract price of $5,288 for the
                                        package, which included, amongst other things, the rental of
                                        various dresses and suits, and photography services for the
                                        wedding day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The supposed licence agreement was
                                        alleged to be found in a form that was concerned with the
                                        collection of gowns. As noted by the trial judge, to have a
                                        sponsorship agreement contained in such a document goes
                                        against the probabilities. Even if the agreement was entered
                                        into between laypersons without the involvement of lawyers,
                                        it would have been expected that there would be more
                                        details, including the limits of the use of the photographs,
                                        either in time or in terms of circulation or media.
                                        Sponsorship without any demarcation of the benefit of making
                                        use of the Respondent’s image would not be likely at
                                        all. Given that the arrangements were also entered into
                                        because of the Respondent’s status as a celebrity,
                                        which the Appellant accepted, it would have been expected
                                        that the arrangements would have more detailed. The
                                        perfunctory nature of the sponsorship agreement suggests
                                        strongly that it was not a true agreement between the
                                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There were a number of other
                                        points that militated against the agreement being formed. As
                                        noted by the trial judge, the alleged bargain or price for
                                        the supposed sponsorship deal was not very high. The cost of
                                        the gowns that were traded for the use of the photographs
                                        was only about $10,000. The Respondent made the point that
                                        the rental of six dresses would not on the evidence be worth
                                        anything close to $10,000. Evidence was given of another
                                        boutique’s package for six dresses which amounted to
                                        only $1,888, and that included rental of men’s
                                        clothing, and other services. The Appellant contended in the
                                        oral hearing of the appeal that the $10,000 claimed was for
                                        a ten day rental. Even so, the figure does seem high on
                                        balance. In return for this service, the Appellant was to
                                        have unqualified use of the photographs without a time
                                        limit. The Appellant argued that this went to questioning
                                        the sufficiency of the consideration given. That is not so.
                                        The point of the trial judge’s analysis of the facts
                                        was not whether valid consideration was given. It was to
                                        deal with a different point – whether the evidence
                                        showed on the balance of probabilities that there was an
                                        agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Appellant also argued that the
                                        fact that the Respondent gave to the Appellant a DVD with
                                        the pre-wedding photoshoot photographs supported the
                                        existence of the agreement. As noted by the
                                        Respondent’s counsel in arguments, the Respondent gave
                                        evidence that the DVD was provided by her to allow the
                                        Appellant to view the use of the wedding gowns. I accept the
                                        evidence of the Respondent in this regard. The giving of a
                                        single DVD without more does not positively show that such
                                        an act was pursuant to an agreement. The explanation
                                        proffered by the Respondent that she felt obliged to do so
                                        because she had rented the Appellant’s gowns was
                                        plausible and likely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As also noted by the trial judge,
                                        the terms were inserted as handwriting, and in a part of the
                                        document concerned with administrative details. Given the
                                        title of the document, and the absence of any evidence that
                                        the Respondent’s attention had been specifically drawn
                                        to the handwritten portions at the time, I am of the view
                                        that there was, on the balance of probabilities, no
                                        agreement reached between the Appellant and Respondent of
                                        the nature alleged by the Appellant. The Appellant argued
                                        that it was highly improbable for her to sneak in terms.
                                        That to my mind was more probable than the Respondent
                                        agreeing to such terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There was also a question of who
                                        actually signed another document, another collection form
                                        dated 28 December 2009. In that form, an extra gown, beyond
                                        the gowns stipulated in the invoice, was collected by the
                                        Respondents’ sisters. This was material in the mind of
                                        the trial judge as it showed that there was a substitution
                                        of one additional gown for the men’s suits. There was
                                        also expert testimony that the signature on that December
                                        collection form was not that of any of the
                                        Respondent’s sisters. The expert evidence instead
                                        showed that it was more likely than not that the documents
                                        was instead signed by the Appellant. This was particularly
                                        disturbing. Given all of this, the trial judge was justified
                                        in finding that the evidence showed there were doubts as to
                                        the credibility of the Appellant. I accept that these
                                        reasons point to concerns about the credibility of the
                                        Appellant in this area, and would further support the
                                        conclusion that her evidence should not be accepted on the
                                        point of the supposed Collection Form licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The trial judge also rejected the
                                        evidence of an ex-employee of the Appellant who had
                                        testified that the Respondent requested sponsorship. For the
                                        reasons stated by the trail judge in his judgement, I accept
                                        that there were a number of inconsistences in her evidence,
                                        and that there were difficulties with her demeanour. I thus
                                        do not find anything that would lead me to disturb the trial
                                        judge’s findings in this area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The trial judge found that the
                                        evidence of the Respondent was to be preferred. I saw
                                        nothing to disturb his conclusions as to whose evidence
                                        should be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Parole evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The parole evidence rule is only
                                        relevant when there is a contract in existence. In view of
                                        my agreement with the finding of the trial judge that there
                                        was in fact no contract for sponsorship, the application of
                                        ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) does
                                        not arise.</p>

                                        with the interpretation of contracts between the parties,
                                        and not with the actual formation and existence of such
                                        contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the present appeal, the
                                        position of the Appellant is that that Collection Form with
                                        the words in handwriting formed a binding agreement –
                                        six gowns would be taken for free by the Respondent in
                                        return for which the photographs in the CD would be
                                        available for use by the Appellant as samples for her
                                        business. It was not the argument of the Appellant that the
                                        license to make use of the pre-wedding photographs had been
                                        agreed upon <em>ab initio</em> in the
                                        contract which was entered into originally for the Appellant
                                        to provide wedding boutique services to the Respondent.
                                        There were thus, on the Appellant’s case, at least two
                                        agreements – one on 2 September 2009 for the initial
                                        engagement of the Appellant and one contained in the
                                        Collection Form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In my view, no contract had arisen
                                        under the Collection Form, and the Collection Form was
                                        simply an acknowledgement and evidence of receipt or
                                        collection of the gowns pursuant to that original contract,
                                        without the handwritten words having any
                                effect</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I note that the trial judge had
                                        considered various matters surrounding the Collection Form
                                        contract on the basis that he could look at the surrounding
                                        circumstances as the contract was <em>incomplete</em> on its face. The trial judge
                                        found that the supposed terms were brief, and many details
                                        were left unsaid, and did not capture even what the
                                        Appellant argued were to be part of the terms governing
                                        their relationship. These various matters to my mind are
                                        actually relevant in terms of the <em>existence</em> of this Collection Form
                                        contract, and would have been better analysed on that
                                        basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     What had happened in the
                                        circumstances was what the Respondent had testified –
                                        that six gowns were provided to the Respondent for her use
                                        in London as compensation for the three men’s suits
                                        not being ready.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Again, I did not think there were
                                        sufficient grounds to disturb the findings of fact made by
                                        the trial judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Non est factum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Appellant referred to the fact
                                        that <em>non est factum</em> was not in
                                        fact pleaded. However, to my mind, <em>non
                                                est factum</em> was not the applicable
                                        doctrine or plea. The Respondent did not deny her signature,
                                        and did not deny the operation of the Collection Form in so
                                        far as it operated as a collection form. What was in issue,
                                        and what she denied, were the handwritten portions. The very
                                        inclusion of the handwritten portions was in doubt, throwing
                                        in issue when it could have been added. This could have been
                                        after the Respondent had signed. In these circumstances, as
                                        there is doubt about the effect of the signature, and what
                                        that signature bound the Respondent to, the <em>non est factum</em> doctrine does not
                                        come into play. Accordingly, I do not find that any of the
                                        usual authorities for the doctrine are relevant
                                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ownership of copyright in the actual day
                                photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The trial judge found that the
                                        photographer for the actual day was commissioned by the
                                        Respondent through the Appellant. What was said at [40] of
                                        the Grounds of Decision was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In relation to the Actual Day Photographs, it is clear
                                                that the Plaintiff had commissioned and paid for the
                                                Actual Day Photographs. The actual day photograph
                                                service was part of the Wedding Package, covered by
                                                the $5,288 package price paid by the Plaintiff. The
                                                fact that the Plaintiff engaged the Defendant for
                                                such services, and the Defendant in turn engaged DW2
                                                to take the Actual Day Photographs, does not change
                                                the result. The fact remains that consideration for
                                                the photography work is ultimately attributable to,
                                                and paid for by, the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff
                                                therefore owns the copyright to the Actual Day
                                                Photographs under Section 30(5) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Conceptually, the approach appears
                                        to have been that the Appellant commissioned the second
                                        photographer on behalf of the Respondent, <em>ie</em>, the Appellant acted as the agent for
                                        the Respondent. This was the characterisation of the trial
                                        judge’s reasoning adopted by the
                                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I find that agency is not borne
                                        out on the facts or by the law. The point that consideration
                                        ultimately came from the Respondent cannot determine the
                                        outcome – back-to-back contracts are common in many
                                        contexts. It does not follow that in such situations that
                                        the intermediate contracts can be disregarded, and that
                                        privity is established between the parties at the two ends
                                        of the chain of transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Privity can be so established if
                                        the intermediary was an agent. This requires that the
                                        erstwhile agent act not for herself, but for the benefit of
                                        the supposed principal. Certainly, as argued by the
                                        Respondent, there may be undisclosed agency, but such
                                        absence of disclosure of the fact of agency only affects the
                                        third party. As between the principal and agent, there
                                        should be consent on both sides for the latter to act for
                                        the former: see <em>Chitty on Contracts
                                                Volume II: Specific Contracts</em> (H G Beale,
                                        gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at para
                                        31-006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     There is nothing in the evidence
                                        adduced at the trial that would establish this on the
                                        balance of probabilities. The issue appears to have received
                                        little attention in testimony and in the arguments below. On
                                        appeal, there was little examination and elucidation of this
                                        issue in the arguments. There was nothing in terms of any
                                        agreement between the Appellant and the Respondent for the
                                        Appellant to act for the latter. There was nothing to show
                                        that there was a direct contractual relationship between the
                                        Respondent and the second photographer. There was nothing in
                                        any documentation, nor was there any testimony to this
                                        effect. There was nothing in terms of the instructions that
                                        the Respondent would have been expected to give to the
                                        second photographer before the event as to the scope of the
                                        work required, terms of payment, or requirements as to the
                                        precise services or equipment that would be deployed.
                                        Certainly, it is conceivable that the second photographer
                                        would have taken on board on the wedding day the
                                        requirements and requests of the bride, the parents, the
                                        maids of honour, and just very possibly, the groom. But that
                                        is a different matter from being in a direct contractual
                                        relationship with any of them. In this context, any
                                        supposition that the Appellant may have thought that he was
                                        an employee of the Respondent is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Furthermore as noted by the
                                        Appellant, the Respondent engaged the Appellant to provide
                                        photography. This must mean there was no intention for the
                                        Respondent to enter into a contract with the photographer.
                                        Finding that agency arose between the Respondent and the
                                        Appellant in respect of the dealing with the second
                                        photographer is highly artificial. I accept the arguments of
                                        the Appellant that an agency was not in the contemplation of
                                        the either the Appellant or the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the absence of any evidence of
                                        an actual commission of the second photographer by the
                                        Respondent, the copyright in those photographs reside either
                                        with the maker, <em>i.e.</em> the
                                        photographer, or with the Appellant. It is not, however,
                                        necessary for me to decide the matter in this appeal. It
                                        suffices that I find that the copyright does not reside with
                                        the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I would also emphasise that the
                                        position as to the existence of agency will vary with the
                                        facts. The conclusion here is based on the evidence adduced
                                        in this case only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Control of the use of the actual day
                                photographs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     An alternative argument, which was
                                        not actually put forward by the Respondent, nor pleaded,
                                        would have been for an equitable assignment. However, I find
                                        that this too is not made out, even had it been permitted to
                                        be argued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     If the concern was with whether
                                        the Appellant could use the photographs as she pleased,
                                        however she may have obtained them, the solution could lie
                                        in the implication of terms in the contracts between the
                                        Respondent and the Appellant, and the Appellant and the
                                        Photographer respectively, that exploiting the photographs
                                        for other purposes would be prohibited. This, however, was
                                        not pleaded, though I note that one of the authorities cited
                                        by the Respondent in the context of commissioning under s
                                        30(5) of the Act –
                                        <em>Pollard v Photographic Company</em>
                                        (1888) 40 Ch D 345 – would actually be relevant in the
                                        context of implication of terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In any event, the issue does not
                                        arise as the Appellant did not commercially exploit these
                                        photographs, as found by the trial judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages awarded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The damages awarded needs to be
                                        reduced by an amount of $1000. This was the amount awarded
                                        by the trial judge for the use of the wedding day
                                        photographs. There was as found by the trial judge little or
                                        no exploitation of these photographs. Since I find that
                                        copyright of these photographs did not reside in the
                                        Respondent, the Respondent is not entitled to damages for
                                        any alleged exploitation of the photographs by the
                                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It was argued that the injunction
                                        should be discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     My finding that the copyright in
                                        the wedding photographs was not vested in the Respondent
                                        means that there was no basis for the injunction on that
                                        ground. Additionally, the Appellant stated in arguments that
                                        there was no danger of any further use of the Respondent's
                                        photographs in any event. I have also referred above to the
                                        possibility that there may be an implied term in the contact
                                        between the Appellant and Respondent. That issue is left to
                                        another forum to determine whether there is such a term in
                                        the present case; it would be a factor that the Appellant
                                        would have to take into account if she were to consider
                                        using the Respondent’s photographs in future. Overall,
                                        I am satisfied that there is little danger of the
                                        Appellant’s future use of the photographs. In the
                                        exercise of my discretion, I accordingly discharge the
                                        injunction in respect of both the pre-wedding and wedding
                                        photographs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Miscellaneous issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Respondent argued that
                                        celebrities have a heightened need for protection of the use
                                        of their image and privacy. No authority was cited for this
                                        proposition. As a matter of principle, a person claiming to
                                        be a celebrity is not entitled to any special treatment
                                        under copyright law. Neither is there any special protection
                                        of privacy of such a person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the trial below, there were
                                        also matters touching on possible estoppel against the
                                        Appellant in respect of the allegations of the use of
                                        photographs, and some other matters going to her
                                        credibility, as well as matters arising out of the
                                        Respondent’s non-disclosure. I did not think these
                                        matters were significant in the appeal and they did not
                                        affect the outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I should also note, and this was
                                        raised in passing by Counsel for the Appellant, that at
                                        least some of the words that supposedly captured the licence
                                        agreement should be excluded. The way the handwritten note
                                        appeared in the Collection Form was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sponsor for Photoshoot Rental FOC    Dry cleaning charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">in return for CD photos as sample book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There was a bit of space between
                                                ‘FOC’ and ‘Dry Cleaning
                                                charge’. It may be that the phrase ‘Dry
                                                Cleaning Charge’ was a separate entry. The
                                                Appellant could not really assist on this in her
                                                testimony. If so, the licence agreement would have
                                                been contained in the following words</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sponsor for Photoshoot Rental FOC in return for CD
                                                photos as sample book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Be that as it may, this would not have
                                                affected the reasoning and
                                outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I will hear the parties on the
                                        costs of the appeal.</p>
