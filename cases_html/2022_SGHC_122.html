</div> The sole questions are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the sentencing discount that should be accorded to the accused on account of the mitigating factors; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the global sentence to be imposed bearing in mind the totality principle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentencing principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The accused’s actions in subjecting his stepdaughter to several instances of sexual assaults is reprehensible. This case clearly warrants the imposition of sentences that incorporate the sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution. It is apparent from the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s submissions that both parties agree with the application of these operative sentencing principles in this case. However, they differ on the application of these principles when it comes to the proposed appropriate deterrent sentences on the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 First, on the principle of general deterrence, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 37 (“<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span>”) stated at [25(a)] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of trust and authority</span>:<span class="font-italic"> </span>Where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence. All those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual urges.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This is consistent with the findings of V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 at [40] and [42]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 Crimes of sexual assault are notoriously difficult to prosecute. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 … In my view, our courts would be grievously remiss if they did not send an unequivocal and uncompromising message to all would-be sex offenders that <span class="font-italic">abusing a relationship or a position of authority in order to gratify sexual impulse will inevitably be met with the harshest penal consequences</span>. In such cases, the <span class="font-italic">sentencing principle of general deterrence must figure prominently</span> and be unmistakably reflected in the sentencing equation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The notorious difficulty of prosecuting intrafamilial sexual abuse is clearly borne out in the prolonged length of time it took for the accused’s sexual assaults to be uncovered. The victim only disclosed the sexual abuse to her cousins close to four years after the last incident of sexual abuse. The accused’s sexual abuse of the victim is a grave abuse of the trust and authority reposed in him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Second, according to the sentencing principle of retribution, the sentences imposed must reflect and befit the seriousness of the crime. Where the victims are young and vulnerable, “the offence becomes much more serious and the punishment meted on such offenders has to reflect the gravity of the offence” (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [20]). The sentence imposed must reflect the public opprobrium towards cases of sexual assault committed against young and vulnerable individuals.

In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal made clear at [45(a)] that forgiveness by the victim is irrelevant<span class="font-italic"> </span>to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence, as forgiveness “is a private matter between the victim and the offender, and should not affect the sentence imposed on the offender by the courts, which reflects the public interest in criminal punishment” (citing <span class="font-italic">UI </span>at [56] and [67]).

</div>
</div> Given that the two instances of SAP were committed on different days, I find that they represent two separate and distinct incursions into the victim’s bodily integrity. I am of the view that to order the two sentences for the 1st charge and the 3rd charge concurrently would not fulfil the twin objectives of deterrence and retribution and would give the accused an undeserved discount for multiple assaults. I, therefore, agree that the sentences for the Charges should run consecutively. This gives rise to an aggregate sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The first limb of the totality principle requires the court to consider whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [54]). Under the second limb of the totality principle, the aggregate sentence may be moderated if it is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and his future prospects (<span class="font-italic">Shouffee </span>at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I find that the aggregate sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane is not crushing as these are grave offences and having regard to the totality of the accused’s criminal behaviour, including his lack of similar antecedents, his early plea of guilt, his sincere remorse and the TIC Charges. I, therefore, find that the global sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane is consistent with the totality principle while also adequately addressing the sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution.

</div> It is also consistent with sentencing precedents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">BWM v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGCA 83 (“<span class="font-italic">BWM</span>”), the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges of SAP under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code for penetrating the male victim’s anus with his penis. The victim was between ten and 14 years old at the time of the offences. The appellant was in a romantic relationship with the victim’s elder sister at the time of both offences and they were married at the time of the second SAP offence. Three other charges, two concerning penile-anal penetration and one concerning outrage of modesty, were taken into consideration for sentencing. The Court of Appeal held at [24] that the global sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was “clearly appropriate in principle and in quantum”, given the appellant’s abuse of his position of trust and authority, the victim’s young age and the appellant’s premeditation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The case of <span class="font-italic">BWM </span>shares many similarities with the present case, save for (a) the length of time over which the offences occurred (four years compared with not more than one year in the present case); (b) the composition of the TIC Charges; and (c) the mitigatory value of the accused’s plea of guilt. In <span class="font-italic">BWM </span>two other penetrative offences and one other outrage of modesty offence were taken into consideration by the court for the purposes of sentencing. In the present case the charges that are taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing are one other <span class="font-italic">attempted</span> penetration offence and two outrage of modesty offences. The appellant in <span class="font-italic">BWM </span>had also attempted to evade the police after the police report was made against him by going into hiding, and the police only managed to arrest him about four years later, by which time he had remarried and had a child with his second wife. The accused in this case was very co-operative with the police and he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Thus, the accused has spared the victim from recalling the trauma of the sexual assaults. Comparing the facts and circumstances of the present case, the present case warrants a lower global sentence than that in <span class="font-italic">BWM</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BLV </span>[2017] SGHC 154, the offender committed a litany of sexual offences against his biological daughter over a period of three years when she was between 11 and 13 years old. Violence was also used in the commission of the sexual offences. The offender had claimed trial to all ten charges and was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the SAP offence after the court considered the totality principle. The offender would otherwise have been sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the SAP offence. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BLV v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 726 increased the sentence for the SAP offence to 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, giving rise to an aggregate sentence of 28 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Having regard to all of the above, I find that the appropriate and fair punishment in this case is an aggregate sentence of 18 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The statutory maximum of 24 strokes of the cane sends a strong signal of deterrence and retribution. This sentence thus strikes the appropriate balance between reflecting the moral and criminal reprehensibility of the accused’s actions, while also avoiding a crushing effect on the accused.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In summary, my findings on sentence are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Deterrence and retribution are the governing sentencing principles given the victim’s young age and the relationship between the accused and the victim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Given the presence of several aggravating factors such as the accused’s abuse of trust and premeditation, the present case falls within the midpoint of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework.
