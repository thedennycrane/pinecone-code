<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is the Defendant’s application for security for costs of the action from
the Plaintiff and/or Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd (“Sinwa HK”), a non-party. The
application for security for costs is based on two grounds, first,
on the basis that Sinwa HK is a non-party under Order 23 rule 1(3)(b);
and second, on the basis that the Plaintiff is a nominal Plaintiff
under Order 23 rule 1(1)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
Plaintiff is a company whose shares are equally owned by the Defendant
and Sinwa HK. The Defendant is also a director of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Prior
to the commencement of this action, Sinwa HK obtained leave from
the Court of Appeal to bring an action in the name and on behalf
of the Plaintiff against the Defendant for alleged breaches of directors’
duties arising from a time-charterparty of a vessel owned by the
Plaintiff. Pursuant to the leave granted by the Court of Appeal,
Sinwa HK commenced this current suit as a derivative action in the
name of the Plaintiff against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Security for Costs against a
Non-party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
Defendant’s application for security for costs against Sinwa HK,
a non-party, is based on Order 23 rule 1(3)(b), which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Where,
on the application of a defendant to an action or other proceeding
in the Court, it appears to the Court –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    that the non-party has contributed
or agreed to contribute to the plaintiff’s costs in return for a
share of any money or property which the plaintiff may recover in
the action or proceeding,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and the non-party is a person against whom
a costs order may be made, then, if having regard to all the circumstances
of the case, the Court thinks it just to do so, it may order the
non-party to give such security for the defendant’s costs of the
action or other proceeding as the Court thinks just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A
two-stage test is to be applied to determine whether a non-party should
be ordered to provide security for the defendant’s costs. At the
first stage, the defendant has to establish that the non-party contributed
or agreed to contribute towards the plaintiff’s legal costs in return
for a share of the money or property which the plaintiff may recover
in the action or proceedings. If the first stage is satisfied, then
the issue at the second stage would be whether the non-party is
a person against whom a costs order may be made and whether it would
be just to order the non-party to provide security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage One – Litigation Funder?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For
the first stage, it was not disputed that Sinwa HK had made payment
of the costs owed by the Plaintiff to the Defendant. The issue before
me was whether this payment of costs was <b><em>in
return</em></b> for a share of any money or property which the
Plaintiff may recover in the action or proceedings. On the facts
before me, there was no agreement between Sinwa HK and the Plaintiff
that Sinwa HK will received any direct benefit or share in the damages
received if the Plaintiff is successful. Rather, the Defendant counsel
argued that a wide interpretation should be applied and an indirect
benefit of the fruits of the litigation would be sufficient to satisfy this
limb. It was pointed out that Sinwa HK had admitted on affidavit
that its shares in the Plaintiff will increase in value if the Plaintiff
is successful.This is the indirect benefit which Sinwa HK would
receive in return for its contribution to the Plaintiff’s costs.
The Defendant counsel submitted that if the Plaintiff was successful
and assuming it recovers USD10 million from the Defendant, the value
of Sinwa HK’s shares in the Plaintiff would increase by USD5 million
as Sinwa HK owns 50% of the issued share capital of the Plaintiff.
This would amount to Sinwa HK paying for the Plaintiff’s costs of
litigation in return for a share of money that the Plaintiff may
potentially recover from the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sinwa
HK’s counsel argued that this rule covers litigation funders, who
fund litigation in exchange for a direct share of the benefits of
the litigation. It was submitted that this does not apply to a derivative
action where Sinwa HK’s contribution towards the Plaintiff’s costs
is not in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the action, but
to pursue the Plaintiff’s rights. The fact that Sinwa HK, a shareholder,
will receive some indirect benefit due to an increase in the share
value does not satisfy the requirements of this rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       An
understanding of the purpose behind this rule would assist in the interpretation
to be applied. In the commentary on Order 23 Rule 1(3) in the <em>Singapore Court Practice 2014</em> (LexisNexis,
2014) at page 1021, Professor Jeffrey Pinsler noted that the scope
of the security for costs provisions were extended to non-parties
as the <em>“limitation of O </em><em>23 to the power to award security for costs against
a nominal plaintiff (and the absence of such a power against the </em><em>non-party plaintiff) was a weakness because the nominal
plaintiff might have been uninterested and impecunious while the non-party,
who was </em><b><em>funding the litigation</em></b><em>, was beyond the reach of the court.”</em> (emphasis
added) Therefore, it appears that the securities for costs provisions
were extended to cover litigation funders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
rationale for extending the security for costs provisions to cover litigation
funders may be seen from the observations of Hodgson JA sitting in
the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Green
(as liquidator of Arimco Mining Pty Ltd) v CGU Insurance Ltd</em> [2008]
NSWCA 148 at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…a court should be readier to order security
for costs where the non-party who stands to benefit from the proceedings
is not a person interested in having rights vindicated, as would
be a shareholder or creditor of a plaintiff corporation, but rather
is a person whose interest is solely to make a commercial profit
from funding the litigation. Although litigation funding is not
against public policy (<em>Campbells Cash and Carry
Pty Limited v Fostif Pty Limited</em> [2006] HCA 41; 229 CLR
386 at [87]-[95]), the court system is primarily there to enable
rights to be vindicated rather than commercial profits to be made;
and in my opinion, courts should be particularly concerned that
persons whose involvement in litigation is purely for commercial
profit should not avoid responsibility for costs if the litigation fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It
seems to me that the Defendant counsel’s interpretation of Order 23
rule 1(3)(b) is not in line with the purpose behind this rule. The
words of Order 23 rule 1(3)(b) support the interpretation that it
is aimed at non-parties whose only interest in the proceedings is
to make a commercial profit i.e. litigation funders. Sinwa HK is
a shareholder who had obtained leave of the Court of Appeal to commence
this derivative action. Sinwa HK clearly has an interest in the
proceedings and is not a litigation funder. Therefore, Stage One
is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stage Two – Whether it would
be just to order security</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Even
if I were to accept that a wide interpretation should be given to Order
23 rule 1(3)(b), which I do not, I am of the view that the second
stage is not satisfied as it would not be just to order Sinwa HK
to provide security for the Defendant’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
principles governing the court’s exercise of discretion in respect of
costs to be paid by a non-party were summarised by the Privy Council
in <em>Dymocks Franchise Systems (NSW) Pty Ltd
v Todd</em> [2004] 1 WLR 2807 (“<em>Dymocks”</em>).
These were adopted with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal
in <em>DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia
Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 542 (“<em>DB Trustees</em>”)
at [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The core consideration in relation to
the court’s exercise of discretion in ordering costs against a non-party
is that it must be <em>just</em>, in all
the circumstances of the case, to do so. …Ordinarily, considerable
weight would be placed on the presence of two factors, <em>viz, a close connection between the non-party and
the proceedings and a causal link between the non-party and the
incurring of costs.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
principles governing the court’s discretion in respect of costs
to be paid by a non-party would similarly apply to the court’s discretion
in respect of the provision of security of costs by a non-party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     First,
while there is a close connection between Sinwa HK and the current
proceedings, this factor by itself would not be sufficient to justify ordering
Sinwa HK to provide security for the Defendant’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While
Sinwa HK is one of the two shareholders of the Plaintiff and would,
therefore, be one of beneficiaries of a successful outcome of the current
proceedings, that is merely one factor to be taken into consideration.
Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd
v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others,
third parties)</em> [2011] 1 SLR 582 (“<em>Raffles
Town Club”</em>) was of the view (at [26]) that the fact that
the non-parties were the only shareholders of the company should not
be the “overriding factor in consideration”. Otherwise, this would “drive
a coach and horses through the doctrine of the separate liability
of the company”. It was further held at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…Fiduciary duties are owed by directors
to the company, not to the shareholders directly, and it is the <em>company</em> which has to enforce those duties against
the directors even though it may well be the present shareholders
and directors who are controlling the litigation. Thus, if the company
has not succeeded in establishing its claim of breach of fiduciary
duties against the directors who are not or no longer shareholders
of the company, <u>it is the company which has
to pay the legal costs of the directors who have successfully resisted
its claims, not the shareholders of the company. Such are the consequences
of the doctrine of separate legal personality</u>. In <em>DB Trustee</em>, it was Ms Koh’s lack of cooperation
with the receivers, denying them access to documents pertaining
to the affairs and property of Consult Asia that precipitated the
litigation instituted by DB Trustees. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Similarly
in <em>Nanyang Law LLC v Alphomega Research Group</em> Ltd [2012]
4 SLR 1153 (“<em>Nanyang Law</em>”), the
doctrine of separate legal personality of a company was the basis
on which Choo Han Teck J declined to order the non-party to bear
the costs of the proceedings. Choo Han Teck J held at [5]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…that by ordering costs against a non-party
who is a shareholder and director of an impecunious litigant company,
the court pierces the corporate veil… [this] is not an order the
court would be quick to make. …being the managing director alone,
and thus, having a substantial connection to the case is only one
of the many factors the court would take into account. It is also
not a principle of law that where a litigant company is unable to
pay costs the successful party can look to the person with a close
connection to it and the litigation for costs. Much of the law that
permits the corporate veil to be lifted concerns fraud or highly
unconscionable conduct. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Second,
the causal link. A non-party would generally not be made liable
for costs if those costs would have been incurred in any event even without
the non-party’s involvement in the proceedings. On the present facts,
this is a derivative action which was commenced in the name of the Plaintiff
by Sinwa HK. While on the surface, it appears that the casual link
is satisfied, it has to be borne in mind that Sinwa HK did not act
unreasonable in commencing this derivative action as it had obtain
and commenced this action with the leave from the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Before
I move on to the third factor, I wish to deal with the Defendant’s
argument that since Sinwa HK is the shareholder directing this common
law derivative action on behalf of the company, it would normally be
expected to pay for the costs of the action, though the fruits of
the victory go to the company. Reliance is placed on <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell Asia, 2005) 3<sup>rd</sup> ed at [9.65]
for this argument. I believe the Defendant has misunderstood Professor
Woon. The position stated by Professor Woon refers to an action
where a shareholder commences the derivative action on behalf of
all the shareholders except the defendants and the company is joined
as a defendant in order to be bound by the results of the the action.
It is in this context that Professor Woon commented that the shareholder,
who is the plaintiff in the derivative action, should expect to pay
for the costs of the litigation. The current proceedings are different
as it is the company who is named as the Plaintiff. As stated above,
the decision to pierce the corporate veil and hold a shareholder,
a non-party, responsible for the costs incurred by the company who
is the Plaintiff is not one which is to be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
third and most important factor is that the Plaintiff is at all material
times a solvent company. Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Raffles
Town Club</em> at [28] held that “apart from the “close connection”
and “causal link” elements, the <em>inability of
the unsuccessful party </em><em>to pay the
costs of litigation</em> is an important factor in the determination
of whether it would be just to make the non-party bear the costs”
(emphasis added). The inability of the unsuccessful company to pay
the costs of litigation in <em>Dymocks</em> and
in <em>DB Trustees</em> was a determinative
factor in the court’s decision to order a third party to bear the
litigation costs of the unsuccessful company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Both
solicitors for the Plaintiff and the Defendant admitted that the Plaintiff
is a solvent company and there is no evidence that it would not
be able to pay the costs of litigation. The Plaintiff has stated
on affidavit that the Plaintiff has funds in a bank account in Singapore
and is also the owner of a vessel which has a desk top value of
approximately USD15.5 million. The Defendant has challenged the
valuation of the vessel saying that the vessel only has a value
of USD2 million. However, the Defendant did not provide any documents
in support of its valuation. In any event, it is clear that the
vessel is a valuable asset which belongs to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I
also understand from both counsels for the Plaintiff and Defendant that
the Plaintiff has not been able to access its funds in its Singapore
bank account as the Defendant has so far not agreed to authorise
any withdrawals from the Plaintiff’s bank account. Therefore, Sinwa
HK has had to pay the costs payable from the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
Since the Plaintiff’s inability to access its funds to pay legal
costs was caused by the Defendant, it would not be just to allow
the Defendant to rely on this as a basis to seek security for costs
from Sinwa HK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For
the above reasons, I am of the view that it would not be just to order
Sinwa HK, a non-party, to provide security for the Defendant’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As
the Defendant has failed to satisfy both Stage One and Two, Sinwa HK
will not be ordered to provide security for the Defendant’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nominal Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
Defendant’s application for security for costs from the Plaintiff
is on the basis that the Plaintiff is a nominal plaintiff. This
is based on Order 23 Rule 1(1)(b) which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1(1)  Where,
on the application of a defendant to an action or other proceeding
in the Court, it appears to the Court –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    that
the plaintiff (not being a plaintiff who is suing in a representative
capacity) is a nominal plaintiff who is suing for the benefit of
some other person and that there is reason to believe that he will
be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if, having regard to all the circumstances
of the case, the Court thinks it just to do so, it may order the
plaintiff to give such security for the defendant’s costs of the
action or other proceedings as it thinks just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
Defendant submits that as the current proceedings were commenced
by Sinwa HK as a derivative action in the Plaintiff’s name and as
Sinwa HK is the main party who has conduct of the current proceedings, the
Plaintiff should be regarded as a nominal plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It
is necessary to understand the nature of a derivative action to
access the weight of the Defendant’s submissions. In <em>Wallersteiner v Moir (No. 2)</em> [1975] 2
WLR 389 (“<em>Wallersteiner</em>”), the English
Court of Appeal at [396 C-D] adopted the observation of <em>Professor Gower in Modern Company Law</em>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed
(1969), p587 as to what constitutes a derivative action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[where an action brought on behalf of the
company by minority shareholders as the company’s representatives
to seek redress for the company] is allowed, the member is not really
suing on his own behalf nor on behalf of the members generally,
but on behalf of the company itself. Although… he will have to frame
his action as a representative one on behalf of himself and all the
members other than the wrongdoers, this gives a misleading impression of
what really occurs. The plaintiff shareholder is not acting as a representative
of the other shareholders, but as a representative of the company…In
the United States … this type of action has been given the distinctive
name of a ‘derivative action,’ recognising that its true nature
is that the individual member sues on behalf of the company to enforce
rights derived from it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     
          <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell Asia, 2005) 3<sup>rd</sup> ed at [9.65]
confirms that in a derivative action, “[normally], the shareholder who
instigates a suit should expect to pay for it, even though the <em>fruits of the victory go to the company</em>.”
(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It
is clear that in while a derivative action is commenced by a shareholder
who has conduct of the proceedings, it is the plaintiff company who
would receive the benefits and fruits of the derivative action. Therefore,
in the current derivative action, the Plaintiff is not suing for
the benefit of some other person. It is the Plaintiff who will receive
the benefits of a successful outcome of the proceedings. The Plaintiff
is not a nominal plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Further,
Order 23 Rule 1(1)(b) also requires the Defendant to show that the
Plaintiff is not able to pay the costs of the Defendant if ordered
to do so. As stated above at [20], I am of the view that the Plaintiff
is a solvent company and will be able to pay the costs of the Defendant
if ordered to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Accordingly,
I am of the view that the Plaintiff company is not a nominal plaintiff
and there are no grounds to order it to provide security for costs
under Order 23 1(1)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In
light of the above, the application for security for costs from
Sinwa HK, a non-party and/or the Plaintiff on the basis it is a
nominal plaintiff was therefore dismissed with costs to the non-party
and the Plaintiff.</p>
