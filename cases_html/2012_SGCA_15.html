        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the wife against a
                    decision of the High Court ordering lump sum maintenance of $75,000, to be paid
                    14 days after the wife transfers a property back to the husband (see
                        <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 202 (“the GD”)). The order of the learned
                    Judge (“the Judge”) embodied the terms of the husband’s
                    offer, which was made in response to the wife’s claim for lump sum
                    maintenance of $292,000. We allowed the wife’s appeal and now set out the
                    detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case concerned the obligations of the
                    respondent husband to maintain the appellant wife after the dissolution of their
                    13.5 year long marriage. The parties were married on 11 October 1995,
                    and by the time the ancillary proceedings had commenced, the wife was
                    60 years old and the husband was 72 years old. As there were no
                    children of the marriage, and the wife did not claim a share of the matrimonial
                    assets, the only ancillary matter before this court was that of maintenance of
                    the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties resided in a double storey corner
                    terrace house during the marriage. The husband retired in 1996, shortly after
                    the marriage. He continued to receive an income of $2,600 per month, constituted
                    by rental of $1,800, an annuity of $350 from his National Trades Union Congress
                    (“NTUC”) insurance policy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    and allowances from the children from his previous marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The wife, who was a full time
                    accounts clerk and bookkeeper drawing a monthly salary of $2,550,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> also
                    stopped working shortly after the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Several factual disputes took centre stage
                    during the proceedings below. Firstly, there was a dispute over whether the
                    husband had maintained the wife during the marriage. The wife claimed that
                    maintenance had been provided, although, as the Judge noted, her position
                    regarding the quantum of maintenance allegedly provided had been inconsistent
                    (see the GD at [6]–[8]). The husband, in contrast, insisted that
                    he had not maintained the wife during the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> As was apparent during
                    submissions (at least on the part of the husband), this insistence was thought
                    to justify the position that a husband who had not maintained his wife during
                    the course of the marriage need not do so after the marriage was dissolved. This
                    was an unfortunate reading of a husband’s obligation to maintain his
                    former wife under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”), which we shall elaborate on later. The second factual
                    dispute concerned the wife’s current financial position. According to her,
                    she now earns $1,100 per month ($800 as a part time accounts clerk and
                    bookkeeper, and $300 from multi level marketing sales).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The husband alleged that she was
                    earning more,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> given the sizable difference between her
                    monthly income of $1,100 and her claimed monthly expenses of
                        $6,344.50.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At a hearing before the Judge on 26 April
                    2011, the husband made an offer of a lump sum payment of $75,000 payable over
                    three monthly instalments provided the wife re-transferred a property in
                    Hainan, Republic of China, known as Unit 15B Lion City Apartment
                    (“the Hainan property”), back to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It was not disputed that the Hainan
                    property, purchased in 2000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and registered in the
                    wife’s name, was wholly paid for by the husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The wife did not argue that the
                    Hainan property was a gift to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Judge found that the wife had been
                    financially independent throughout the marriage (see the GD at [27]), and, as such, the only
                    “loss” suffered by her following the dissolution of the marriage
                    was the loss of accommodation (see the GD at [24]). The wife’s financial independence was inferred from
                    her failure to prove receipt of maintenance during the course of the marriage
                    (see the GD at [17] and [27]), her failure to explain how she had
                    bridged the difference between her monthly expenses of $6,344.50 and the monthly
                    sums allegedly provided by the husband during the marriage (see the GD at
                        [22]), as well as the fact that
                    parties had kept their finances separate (see the GD at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Judge held that, but for the husband’s
                    offer, he would have awarded the wife a lump sum of no more than $48,300 (see
                    the GD at [27]), based on a multiplicand
                    of $575 per month (the monthly rental for a room in a Housing and Development
                    Board (“HDB”) flat) and a multiplier of 7 years, <em>ie</em>, $575 x 12 x 7. In the light of
                    this, the Judge found the husband’s offer to be generous and thus ordered
                    him to pay $75,000 in three monthly instalments of $25,000, commencing within
                    14 days after the wife transferred the Hainan property back to him (see the
                    GD at [4] and [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The issues which arose before this court were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Judge was correct in
                        finding that lump sum maintenance of $75,000 was fair and reasonable in the
                        circumstances (“Issue 1”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the maintenance order should be
                        conditional upon the transfer of the Hainan property back to the husband
                        (“Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As alluded to at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above, an interesting question that arose in connection with
                    Issue 1 (and which will be dealt with below) was whether a husband who had
                    not maintained his wife during the course of the marriage was entitled to raise
                    this in divorce ancillary proceedings in order to avoid having to maintain his
                    former wife <em>post</em> dissolution of the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ respective arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Counsel for the wife, Mr Cheah Kok Lim
                    (“Mr Cheah”), argued that proof of maintenance during the
                    marriage should not be the chief focus since the Act does not require a wife to
                    produce such proof before she may claim maintenance <em>post</em> dissolution of the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Mr Cheah argued
                    that, since a husband is under a duty to maintain his wife during the marriage,
                    the provision of maintenance during the marriage is, at best, <em>one</em> of the many factors that the court should consider when
                    ordering maintenance to be paid after the divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He also took issue with
                    the Judge’s inference that the wife was financially independent, arguing
                    that the sum of $6,344.50 represented her current estimated expenses, which
                    included anticipated medical expenses of $500 and rental of $1,500 which she
                    would now have to pay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Finally, Mr Cheah argued that the
                    court should take into account the wife’s old age,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    the husband’s financial resources, as well as the fact that the wife had
                    not received any share of the matrimonial assets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    In the circumstances, he argued that a lump sum payment of $292,000 in favour of
                    the wife, based on a multiplicand of $1,800 per month (<em>ie</em>, the rental of an HDB flat) and a multiplier of 13.5 years,
                    being the length of marriage, would be the appropriate order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In response, counsel for the husband,
                    Mr Michael Moey (“Mr Moey”), argued that as the husband
                    had never maintained the wife during the course of the marriage, there was no
                    reason why he had to do so now.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Mr Moey argued
                    that the husband was, in any case, only obliged to provide the wife with rental
                    of a <em>room</em> in an HDB flat because parties had
                    shared a bedroom in the matrimonial home and the wife was usually away for most
                    part of the day, treating the home like a hotel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Mr Moey argued
                    that providing more maintenance to the wife would be tantamount to giving her a
                    share of the matrimonial assets <em>via</em> the back
                        door.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The general law on maintenance of a former wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The court derives its power to order
                    maintenance from s 113 of the Act. Section 114 of the Act was modelled
                    on s 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (c 18) (UK) (“the
                    1973 UK Act”). The 1973 UK Act is a consolidating act, which repealed and
                    re-enacted s 5 of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970
                    (c 45) (UK) (“the 1970 UK Act”), prior to the amendment in
                    1984 referred to below (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>).
                    Section 114 of the Act sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors to be
                    considered as well as the guiding principle of financial preservation, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114.—(1) In determining the amount of any
                        maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall
                        have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following
                        matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the income, earning capacity, property and
                                other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage
                                has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the financial needs, obligations and
                                responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is
                                likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family
                                before the breakdown of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the
                                duration of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    any physical or mental disability of either of
                                the parties to the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    the contributions made by each of the parties
                                to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any
                                contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the
                                family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or
                                nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the
                                marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of
                                the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Generally, assessment of the appropriate
                    monthly multiplicand begins with the wife’s financial needs as derived
                    from her particulars of expenditure, scaled down for reasonableness: see the
                    Singapore High Court decision of <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee
                        (alia Ho Kian Guan)</em> [1995] SGHC 23 (“<em>Quek Lee Tiam</em>”) at [16]. The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) of the
                    Act is that of financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained
                    at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard
                    of living she had enjoyed during the marriage. A clear application of this
                    principle was found in <em>Quek Lee Tiam</em> (at [19]), where Lai Kew Chai J held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he principle of financial preservation means that she should have
                        accommodation commensurate with 26 Lynwood Grove in standard though not
                        in size because she is single. She should be provided a car, not the Honda
                        Concerto which was used to ferry the dogs, but a Mercedes 200. She should
                        have food, sartorial, cosmetic and other usual allowances as if she remained
                        as Mrs Ho. He has to provide her with a membership in a golf club as
                        she was a very keen golf player at his request, if not insistence. What
                        would be wrong and contrary to the principle of preservation is to award her
                        a sum of maintenance which would relegate her to the standard of living
                        before the marriage.</p>

                    however, been criticised for ignoring the very fact that triggered the
                    application for maintenance, <em>viz</em>, termination of
                    the marriage, and for restricting the court to the sole consideration of
                    parties’ conduct when reflecting upon the justice of the order: see

                    criticism was articulated in the following terms by Lord Hailsham of

                    Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Bill (which was subsequently enacted as the

                        regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which
                        they would have been had the marriage not broken down. This is to set the
                        court an impractical and wholly undesirable objective. The basis of divorce
                        being the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, it is neither practicable
                        nor desirable to attempt to put the financial eggs back in their shells.
                        This would involve the courts in a miracle worthy of my reputed predecessor,

                        (“<em>NI v NJ</em>”) at [15]–[16]. Indeed, Lord Gardiner LC referred to instances of the
                    possible pitfalls which might occur (and which the commonsense holistic approach
                    adopted by the Singapore courts <em>avoids</em>) during the

                    the provision upon which s 114 of the Act was modelled), as follows (see

                    cols 267-268):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In its present form, Clause 5(1) requires the court, first, to consider
                        the relevant factors set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) and then so
                        far as it is practicable and, having regard to the conduct of the parties,
                        “just to do so”, to put the party in whose favour the order is
                        to be made in the position he or she would or should have been had the
                        marriage not broken down. <em>This formula could lead to the
                            conclusion that, where no question of penalising misconduct arises, and
                            where there is enough money to do so, the court must put the payee in
                            his “pre-breakdown” position, regardless of the effect on
                            the payer. This could produce a most unfortunate result. If one takes a
                            case where there is a decree granted to a wife petitioner on the grounds
                            of five years’ separation and no question arises of misconduct by
                            either husband or wife, the wife may be receiving an appreciable income
                            of her own—for example from practice as a doctor or from the
                            profits of a business—which is much greater than that of her
                            husband. From the way the parties behaved before the breakdown, it may
                            be clear that, but for the breakdown, the wife would have continued to
                            be the financial mainstay of the family. It would hardly be right for
                            the husband to claim that, on divorce, he was entitled to be put back in
                            his financial status quo, even if this meant the wife's paying him more
                            than half her income.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is notoriously true that two separate homes are much
                            more expensive to run than one. It will, therefore, in almost every case
                            be impracticable so to reallocate the resources of the parties as to put
                            one spouse in his or her pre-breakdown financial position without
                            drastically reducing the standard of living of the other. In some cases,
                            for example where that other's conduct is the more blameworthy, this may
                            be a fair result. But where there is no question of one being more to
                            blame than the other, it will not be fair. The principle underlying the
                            Amendment is that the court should aim at getting as near as possible to
                            putting both parties in their pre-breakdown financial position, so that,
                            where some reduction in the standard of living is inevitable (as it
                            usually will be), that reduction is shared and not borne entirely by one
                            party—save where his own bad conduct makes it just that he should
                            be the one to suffer the greater financial loss.</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Consequently (and in accordance with this commonsense holistic
                    approach), our courts have held, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    a former wife must, where possible, exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful
                    employment and contribute to preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle: see, for
                    example, <em>Quek Lee Tiam</em> at [22] and <em>NI v NJ</em>
                    at [14]–[16].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The court must also consider the
                    husband’s financial ability to meet the maintenance order. Thus, although
                    the husband is <em>prima facie</em> obliged to maintain his
                    former wife beyond his retirement and up to the former wife’s remarriage
                    or the death of either party, the former wife who has assets of her own should
                    not expect a full subsidy for her lifestyle: see, for example, the Singapore
                    High Court decision of <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em>
                    [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 (“<em>Yow Mee
                        </em><em>Lan</em>”) at [93].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for the period over which maintenance is to
                    be paid, this court, in <em>Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau
                        </em><em>Poo</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545
                        (“<em>Ong Chen Leng</em>”) at
                    [35]–[36], applied a multiplier of 17 years to the multiplicand of
                    $600 per month as a compromise between the average life expectancy of a
                    woman (70 years) and the usual retirement age of a Singapore male
                    worker (65 years), less the wife’s present age (50 years). This
                    was however not a hard and fast rule: see <em>Rosaline Singh v
                        Jayabalan Samidurai (alias Jerome Jayabalan)</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 457 (“<em>Rosaline
                    Singh</em>”) at [13] and
                        <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> at [97], where the High Court in
                    the latter case held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The wife in this case was aged 51 at the time of the
                        hearing…If I were to apply the quantification adopted in <em>Ong Chen Leng</em>'s case, I would take a multiplier of
                        16 years on the same reasoning as used there. In this case, however,
                        the monthly quantum of maintenance awarded is considerably higher than that
                        at issue in [<em>Ong Chen Leng</em>] and I am sensible
                        of the point made by the district judge that the wife cannot expect to be
                        maintained at the same standard after the husband retires…. In the
                        circumstances, I consider that the fairer way of dealing with the problem
                        would be to award the wife a lump sum based on full maintenance for eight
                        years (<em>ie[,]</em> up to the husband reaching the
                        age of 60) and on half maintenance for a further eight years. Accordingly, I
                        allow the wife's appeal in relation to maintenance and vary the lump sum
                        awarded to $259,200.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the final analysis, it is the
                    reasonableness of the maintenance claim <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the husband’s ability to pay, which guides the court’s application
                    of the principle of financial preservation (see also the recent decision of this
                    court in <em>AQS v AQR</em> [2012] SGCA 3 at [52]
                        (“<em>AQS</em>”)). As factors leading up
                    to the breakdown of marriages are varied and often incommensurable, no single
                    formula can ensure a just result in each and every case. Consequently, courts
                    have accepted that the exercise of assessing maintenance must be undertaken
                    flexibly, with “a commonsense dose of realities” (see <em>Quek Lee Tiam</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Can a husband who has not maintained his wife during the course of
                the marriage raise this fact in divorce ancillary proceedings in order to avoid
                providing maintenance post dissolution of the marriage?</p>
<p>20Before us, counsel for the wife, Mr Cheah, argued that the Judge was
                    wrong to hold that the wife was not entitled to maintenance unless she could
                    prove that she was maintained during the course of the marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Counsel for
                    the husband, Mr Moey argued, naturally, that such an approach was
                        correct.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> It was unfortunate
                    that both parties had not given the Judge’s decision a fair reading: It
                    was quite clear, in our view, that the Judge had rightly looked at maintenance
                    during the marriage as an <em>indicator</em> of the
                    wife’s financial independence, rather than as a <em>pre-requisite</em> for claiming post-divorce maintenance (see the GD
                    at [16]–[17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In any event, we were unable to locate
                    authorities in support of the husband’s broad – indeed, sweeping
                    – proposition to the effect that one who has not maintained his wife
                    during the course of the marriage need not do so after the divorce. Indeed,
                    s 69(1) of the Act imposes an obligation on a husband to provide
                    maintenance to his wife during the course of the marriage. Of course, what is
                    reasonable depends on all the circumstances of the case; that a wife is
                    financially capable does not <em>per se</em> excuse a
                    husband from his duty to maintain her, although it may affect the quantum of
                    maintenance deemed to be reasonable: see Tan Cheng Han, <em>Matrimonial Law in Singapore and Malaysia</em> (Butterworths Asia,
                    1994) at pp 205–206. While non-provision of maintenance during
                    subsistence of the marriage could therefore be justified in some situations, a
                    husband’s reliance on his failure to provide maintenance during the
                    marriage <em>per se</em>, in order to evade his duty to
                    maintain his former wife after divorce, cannot possibly sit well with the
                    court’s sense of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Furthermore, the duty of a husband to maintain
                    his wife during the marriage, as provided by s 69(1) of the Act, and the
                    obligation to provide maintenance to a former wife under s 113 of the Act
                    are driven by separate forces. As Prof Leong Wai Kum pointed out in
                        <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> at
                    p 476:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the former situation, the objective is to provide modest maintenance,
                        namely, to help her overcome her immediate financial need which may well be
                        the same objective when ordering maintenance for a dependent child. In the
                        latter situation, maintenance ordered for a former wife, however, serves the
                        far more ambitious objective of giving her a fair share of the surplus
                        wealth that had been acquired by the spouses during the subsistence of the
                        marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, while the court must have regard to all circumstances of the
                    case when ordering maintenance in both contexts, the matters that the Act
                    specifically directs the court to consider under ss 69(4) and 114 of
                    the Act are not identical. It is thus conceivable that one who justifiably fails
                    to maintain his wife during the course of their marriage may nevertheless be
                    obliged to do so after the marriage has ended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We have emphasised that while non-provision of
                    maintenance during the course of the marriage may point towards the wife’s
                    financial independence, it is not a factor that should be given conclusive
                    weight. In any event, we were mindful that, despite his claims that no
                    maintenance had been provided to the wife, the husband had admitted to providing
                    her with accommodation and related outgoings during the marriage
                        itself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Although the wife did not produce evidence of
                    payment of rental to her nephew with whom she is currently residing, the Judge
                    decided to give her the benefit of doubt as it was unclear whether she would be
                    able to stay with her nephew indefinitely (see the GD at [25]). This was a sensible approach, which
                    accorded with the following observations made (albeit in a slightly different
                    context) by this court in <em>Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum
                        Yong</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 605 (“<em>Tan Bee Giok</em>”) (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The wife is 49 years old. She has no career or skill to speak of and
                        does not appear to have any other means to support herself. Shutting her out
                        from maintenance would leave her vulnerable in her present relationship with
                        the party cited or other friends which carries with it none of the
                        obligations of marriage on their part. In other words, there is no
                        obligation on the part of the party cited or her other friends to continue
                        to provide funds for her subsistence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We were however of the view that it would be
                    more reasonable to provide the wife with rental of an HDB <em>flat</em>, rather than that of a <em>room</em>
                    in an HDB flat. When applying the principle of financial preservation, the
                    standard of living against which the wife’s current maintenance
                    entitlement should be gauged is that which she enjoyed <em>prior
                        to the breakdown of the marriage</em>, instead of that <em>prior to the marriage</em>: see s 114(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act and <em>Quek Lee
                        Tiam</em> at [19]. Bearing in
                    mind that parties had resided in a double storey terrace house during the
                    marriage, a rented room in an HDB flat fell too far short of the standard of
                    accommodation commensurate with that of the matrimonial home. Indeed, this view
                    is wholly consistent with – and serves, in fact, to illustrate
                        - the commonsense holistic approach which has been
                    endorsed by our courts (as to which see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>).</p>
<p>26As the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order
                    division of matrimonial assets, courts regularly take into account each
                    party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate
                    quantum of maintenance to be ordered: see, for example, <em>BG v
                        BF</em> at [75]–[76], <em>Rosaline
                        Singh</em> at [13]; <em>Tan Bee Giok</em> at [27] and <em>AQS</em> at [51]. Indeed, this
                    inquiry falls within the matters to be considered under s 114(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act (see above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>). However, the husband argued that since the wife did not
                    claim a share of the matrimonial assets, and since he would have to sell the
                    matrimonial home in order to provide her with rental of an HDB flat, the wife
                    would effectively be obtaining a share of the matrimonial assets <em>via</em> the backdoor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> We did not agree with this
                    contention. Firstly, it was apparent that the husband had an interest in several
                    properties, shares and overdraft facilities<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and would be able to meet the maintenance
                    order. Secondly, requiring the husband to pay for <em>rental</em> of an HDB flat was eminently reasonable in the
                    circumstances, given the type of accommodation the wife had been accustomed to
                    during the marriage. It would perhaps have been a different matter had the wife
                    requested the purchase price of an HDB flat, or if parties had lived in an HDB
                    flat prior to the breakdown of their marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the circumstances, we were of the view that
                    an order for lump sum maintenance of $126,000 would be fair and reasonable,
                    based on a multiplicand of $1,500, being the monthly rental of an HDB flat, and
                    a multiplier of 7 years. The husband submitted that <em>Yow
                        Mee Lan</em> should be applied to halve the multiplicand in order to
                    account for his status as a retiree. However, the fact that the husband is
                    already retired served to distinguish this case from <em>Yow Mee
                        Lan</em>, where the court took into account the husband’s
                        <em>prospective</em> retirement by halving maintenance
                    for the relevant post-retirement period. Since the multiplicand of $1,500 was
                    arrived at after considering the parties’ age and the wife’s
                    relative self-sufficiency, the husband’s retirement has already been
                    accounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Although we appreciated the Judge’s
                    concern that the wife should take necessary steps to transfer the Hainan
                    property back to the husband, we saw merit in the wife’s argument that
                    this could prejudice her if the transfer takes a long time,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    especially since it was unclear how long such transfers typically took in
                    Hainan. In the circumstances, we ordered that maintenance payments should not be
                    linked to the transfer of the Hainan property. However, we ordered the wife to
                    provide her fullest cooperation for the transfer to be effected. The husband
                    would bear the costs of the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the reasons set out above, we allowed the
                    appeal and awarded the wife lump sum maintenance of $126,000, to be paid within
                    three months from the date of order. We also ordered the wife to cooperate fully
                    with the husband with respect to the transfer of the Hainan property back to
                    him. Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, we ordered costs of
                    the appeal in favour of the wife to be fixed at $10,000 plus reasonable
                    disbursements.</p>
