The funds under the CBSAs were disbursed by the plaintiff to Polimet, which was set up as an SPV for this purpose.

The consent judgment provides that: (a) Polimet is to pay the plaintiff (i) US$39,057,063 as the sum owed as at 29 June 2016 comprising approximately US$18,685,477 as the outstanding sum owed under the CBSAs along with facility fees and contractual default interest of 2% per month; and (ii) continuing contractual interest of 2% per month until the date of full payment; and (b) Lee and Ho are to pay the plaintiff US$8,744,501 pursuant to the PGs and interest at 5.33% per annum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>The Settlement Agreement makes clear that there are two broad issues which are still in dispute. First, the Initial Shareholders deny that they are liable under Clause 12.1 for Polimet’s entire liability by reason of its default under Clause 11.1(a) (“Polimet’s default”). Second, the defendants submit that the default interest of 2% per month provided for under Clause 5.5 of the CBSAs is an unenforceable penalty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ respective cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>The plaintiff submits that the language of Clause 12.1 is clear and unambiguous – it is a general indemnity which imposes a joint and several obligation on the Initial Shareholders to hold the plaintiff harmless from “any… losses” caused to it by “any breach” of the CBSAs. There is nothing in the language of the clause limiting its scope or excluding the losses caused by Polimet’s failure to make repayments. The commercial context of the case and the surrounding circumstances also show that the Clause 12.1 is a general indemnity. The plaintiff is thus entitled to claim <span class="font-italic">all the sums</span> owing by Polimet under the CBSAs from the Initial Shareholders pursuant to Clause 12.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>In addition, the plaintiff asserts that Chia and Yeo did not represent that the Initial Shareholders’ liability would be limited to the loss of their initial shareholding in Polimet and deny the First and Second Oral Agreements.

Lee and Ho claim that their liability is limited by the PGs whilst Ong’s and Yap’s case is that they are not personally liable at all. They rely on the purported First and Second Oral Agreements as well as the background circumstances of the case – including the negotiations over the provision of PGs by the Initial Shareholders – to support their position that Clause 12.1 was never intended to operate as a general and unlimited indemnity under which the Initial Shareholders could be held personally liable for all of Polimet’s liabilities under the CBSAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>In the alternative, the Initial Shareholders submit that there was either a common mistake made by both parties or a unilateral mistake made by the Initial Shareholders as to the nature and effect of Clause 12.1.

</div> Ong in particular was adamant that he would not agree to the investment if he had to bear any personal liability beyond the loss of his shares as he only wished to be a passive investor. This led to the purported 7 August 2007 meeting between Lee, Chia and Yeo at which the First Oral Agreement was reached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span>Chia and Yeo, on the other hand, testified that the PGs were first raised at the earlier 27 July 2007 meeting. They acknowledge that there was a telephone conversation with Lee on 3 August 2007 to discuss the PGs. But they deny informing Lee that PGs were required from all the Initial Shareholders. Rather, KC only required PGs from the shareholders managing the business, namely Lee and Ho. After Lee indicated that it may be difficult to get Ho to agree to provide a PG, it was Chia who suggested that the PGs of Lee and Ho be limited to their collective shareholding in the SPV (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 50%). There was no representation made that any of the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability would be limited to their shares in the SPV. Subsequently, there was no 7 August 2007 meeting nor was the issue of the Initial Shareholder’s personal liability raised at the 22 August 2007 dinner.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Initial discussions on PGs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>To begin with the initial discussions, I accept Lee’s evidence that the requirement to provide PGs was only raised in Term Sheet 1 and not at the 27 July 2007 meeting.

Be that as it may, it is clear that Term Sheet 1 did not specify which of the Initial Shareholders were to provide PGs.

</div> In that email, Lee mentioned a meeting <span class="font-italic">with AFG</span> on 7 August 2007 and suggested changes to Term Sheet 1. In addition, she informed Chia that she had managed to convince Ho to provide a PG. Crucially, nothing was said in that email, or in any subsequent email, of the 7 August 2007 meeting. There was also no mention of any oral agreement that, apart from the PGs, Lee, Ho and Ong’s personal liability under the investment would be limited to the loss of their shares in the SPV (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the First Oral Agreement). If there had been such an oral agreement, one would have expected Lee to have recorded and confirmed it immediately, particularly given her evidence that Ong was not willing to proceed with the investment unless his personal liability was so limited and she knew that this was an important issue to Ong. Instead, there was a glaring absence of any documentary evidence of both the meeting and the First Oral Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>Therefore, on balance, I conclude that the 7 August 2007 meeting did not take place and there was no First Oral Agreement concluded on that day.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">22 August 2007 dinner </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>I also do not accept Lee, Ho and Ong’s account of the 22 August 2007 dinner (see [15] above). According to them, the dinner was arranged so that Ong could meet Chia to confirm the First Oral Agreement before approving the investment with KC. However, by then, the Final Term Sheet – which Ong had seen – had been executed. The Final Term Sheet clearly stated that only Lee and Ho were to provide PGs. Ong himself explained that he only wanted to make sure that he did not have to provide a PG when he discussed the Term Sheets with Lee. Apart from that, he did not instruct Lee to specifically include a term in the Final Term Sheet to confirm that his personal liability would be limited to the loss of his shares. When asked why, he explained that he saw no need for such a term be included in the Final Term Sheet; as long as he was not required to provide a PG, then “it’s all right” and that was the end of the matter for him.

</div> If that was indeed true, there would have been no reason for Ong to bring up the issue of his personal liability at the dinner – in his mind, the issue was settled by then and it was “all right”.  Accordingly, I find that there was no confirmation of the purported First Oral Agreement at this dinner.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second Oral Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>The Initial Shareholders also claimed that there was a Second Oral Agreement in relation to Yap – that he would not be required to provide any PG and that his personal liability would be limited to the loss of his shares in the SPV. Again, it is uncontested that Yap did not provide a PG. So the actual issue is whether there was a binding agreement limiting his personal liability to the loss of his 3% share in the SPV.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>On this purported oral agreement, Lee’s evidence was again shifting and contradictory.

</div> She sought to explain that she had done so because the provision of the PGs was reflected in the Term Sheet. This made no sense – by the time Yap came into the picture, the Final Term Sheet had been signed, which expressly required PGs only from Lee and Ho. Likewise there was no reason for Lee to have specifically discussed Yap’s personal liability under the investment with Chia and Yeo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>Accordingly, I reject Lee’s testimony that KC had expressly agreed with her that Yap need not provide a PG and that his personal liability would be limited to the loss of his shares.  I accept Yap’s testimony that he was reluctant to get involved in the investment and was happy for his shares in Fortuna HK to be bought out and for him to simply remain an employee of the business. I observed him to be a candid witness. Hence it is possible that Lee made assurances to Yap in relation to his personal liability under the investment because she was anxious to get him on board. However there is no credible evidence that such assurances came from Chia or Yeo. Yap did not participate in any negotiations relating to the CBSAs with KC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Observation on the Initial Shareholders’ case on the First and Second Oral Agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>There is one other important observation which needs to be made. Despite the ostensible importance of the First and Second Oral Agreements, they were never reduced into writing. Ong, being a director of two public listed companies, was acutely aware of the importance of putting agreements in writing, especially if they were meant to protect him.

</div>
</div> This explanation makes sense in relation to the PGs – if KC had initially demanded that PGs were required from Ong and Yap and then subsequently agreed to waive this requirement, there would no need for this waiver to be expressly recorded in the Final Term Sheet or the CBSAs. The fact that Ong and Yap did not in fact sign any PGs would speak for itself. The difficulty which the Initial Shareholders face in relation to the First and Second Oral Agreements is that they are not seeking to prove such an omission or waiver. Rather, their case is that there was a positive and binding agreement limiting their personal liability to the loss of their shares in the SPV. I am not persuaded that such a limitation was ever discussed, let alone agreed, between the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>That is not to say the Initial Shareholders were unconcerned about their personal liability under the investment. In fact, that was far from the case. Even Chia and Yeo accept that Lee was worried about the PGs and had some difficulty persuading Ho to provide one. Similarly, I do not doubt Ong and Yap’s evidence that they would not have entered into the investment if they were required to sign PGs. However, <span class="font-italic">besides discussions in relation to the PGs</span>, there was no real discussion on the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability, at least until the Salzburg meeting in September 2007. From this, it appears that the Initial Shareholders assumed that the PGs and their personal liability under the investments were coterminous – as Ong tellingly put it, they thought it would be “all right” as long as they did not sign a PG. Whether this assumption was justified is a separate matter, which is discussed below (at [97]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Impact of entire agreement clause in the CBSAs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>For completeness, I note that even if the First and Second Oral Agreements had been made, they would not have been legally enforceable due to Clause 14.1 of the CBSAs which reads:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Entire Agreement</span>: This Agreement and the documents referred to herein are in substitution for all previous agreements, both written and oral, between all or any of the parties and contain the whole agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>It is clear that the CBSAs and the purported First and Second Oral Agreements concern the same subject matter, namely the liability of the Initial Shareholders under the investment. Hence, even if there were any prior oral agreements between the parties limiting the Initial Shareholders’ liability under the investment, these collateral agreements would have been superseded by the terms of the CBSAs. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span>”), absent fraud or some other vitiating element, provisions such as Clause 14.1 will generally be given effect to, so that prior discussions concerning the contract may not prevail over what has been acknowledged in writing to constitute the parties’ “entire agreement” (at [32] citing <span class="font-italic">MacMillan v Kaiser Equipment Ltd</span> [2004] BCJ 969). In the present case, there was no allegation that there is any such factor to vitiate Clause 14.1. In such circumstances, the First and Second Oral Agreements have no contractual force, save in so far as they are reflected and given effect in the CBSAs (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei </span>at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span> Here, I pause to note that the issue of whether the First and Second Oral Agreements are contractually enforceable is separate from the evidential question of whether the facts relating to the various meetings and communications between the parties leading up to the 2007 CBSA are admissible as extrinsic evidence to aid the court in interpreting the terms of the CBSAs, particularly Clause 12.1. The latter is a distinct, albeit related, issue which is discussed below (at [90]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Scope of Clause 12.1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>The law on contractual interpretation is well settled, though not always easy to apply. Put simply, interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the expressions in a document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties at the time of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembco</span><span class="font-italic">rp Marine</span>”) at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>The text is always the first port of call, but the relevant context is also important and the court must ascertain, based on all the relevant objective evidence, the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the contract (<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd)</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1187 at [32]). To assist in this exercise, the courts have also laid down various canons of interpretation. There is also the issue of the parol evidence rule, as encapsulated in s 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), which governs the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in aid of contractual interpretation. I will deal with these matters in due course. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>I first set out Clause 12.1 which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">12. INDEMNITY</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12.1 <span class="font-weight-bold">General Indemnity</span>. The Initial Shareholders and the Issuer hereby jointly and severally agree and undertake to fully indemnify and hold the Bondholder and its shareholders and their respective fund managers, directors, officers and employees (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Indemnified Parties</span>”) harmless from and against any claims, damages, deficiencies, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and disbursements on a full indemnity basis) directly or indirectly caused to the Indemnified Parties and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, for any short-fall, depletion or diminution in value of the assets of the Issuer, the Group or any Group Company resulting directly or indirectly from or arising out of any breach or alleged breach of any of the representations, warranties, undertakings and covenants given by the Initial Shareholders and/or the Issuer under this Agreement or for any breach or alleged breach of any term or condition of this Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>It is not disputed that Clause 12.1 is an indemnity clause, namely an undertaking by the defendants to keep the plaintiff “harmless against loss” arising from particular transactions or events (see <span class="font-italic">China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (formerly known as China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd) v Teoh Cheng Leong</span> [2012] 2 SLR 1 at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Such an indemnity often takes the form of a promise by one contracting party (Y) to the other contracting party (X) that if X suffers a loss, whether due to the acts of Y or a third party who is not privy to the contract, then Y is to indemnify X against such loss <span class="font-italic">as long as</span><span class="font-italic"> the loss falls within the scope of the indemnity</span>. But there is no reason, as a matter of principle, why an indemnity clause cannot provide for X to be indemnified by Y for a loss caused by another party (Z), who is also a party to the same contract. It all depends on what the parties intend. In <span class="font-italic">Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society v Reg Austin Insurances Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> (1985) 9 ACLR 909 (“<span class="font-italic">Scottish Amicable</span>”), for instance, the company entered into an agency agreement with the plaintiff which was also signed by the company’s directors. The agency agreement contained the following indemnity clause:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We, [the directors] in consideration of [the plaintiff] having entered into the within agreement with the said [company] hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold indemnified the [plaintiff] against any loss which it may sustain <span class="font-italic">by reason of any default by the </span><span class="font-italic">said [company] in payment to the [plaintiff] of amounts which may from time to time become due</span> to the [plaintiff] under the terms of the said agreement.   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>The issue in <span class="font-italic">Scottish Amicable</span> was whether the plaintiff could establish a claim against the directors personally even though, on its face, the agreement had been signed by them “on behalf of” the company. That issue, which was determined in favour of the plaintiff, does not arise here as it is undisputed that the Initial Shareholders signed the CBSAs in their personal capacities. Nevertheless, the case indicates that it is possible for an indemnity clause in a loan instrument entered into by a company to also impose personal liability on its directors or shareholders, who are signatories to the same document, for the company’s principal debt obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>In the present case, the Initial Shareholders jointly executed the CBSA with Polimet and Clause 12.1 imposes an indemnity on all the defendants jointly and severally. The issue at hand is the <span class="font-italic">scope</span> of Clause 12.1 – whether it covers losses caused to the plaintiff by Polimet's failure to make repayments and thereby makes the Initial Shareholders personally liable for all the sums owing by Polimet under the CBSAs, which is over US$39m.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable canons of interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>Before I begin my analysis proper, there are some relevant canons, or principles, of interpretation which need to be kept in mind.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>The first is that, in cases of ambiguity, contracts of indemnity are to be construed strictly in favour of the indemnifier (see <span class="font-italic">General Surety &amp; Guarantee Co Ltd v Francis Parker Ltd</span> (1977) 6 BLR 16 at 21; James O’Donovan and John Phillips, <span class="font-italic">The Modern Contract of Guarantee </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2ndEnglish Ed, 2010) at para 5-15). This is partly because, unlike a guarantor’s liability under a guarantee which is secondary to the liability of the principal debtor, an indemnifier’s liability is primary and independent. As Russell LJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Stadium Finance Co Ltd v Helm </span>(1965) 109 SJ 471, a clearer form must be in place if a primary obligation is intended to be imposed, bearing in mind that most people are not prepared to subject themselves to the nuisance of primary liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span>Another reason for construing any ambiguity in an indemnity in favour of the indemnifier is related to another canon of interpretation – the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentum </span>rule that “where a particular species of transaction, contract, or provision is one-sided or onerous it will be construed strictly against the party seeking to rely on it” (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”) at [131]). This rationale particularly applies in cases where the interpretation of the indemnity clause being advanced by the indemnified party is inherently improbable or commercially insensible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Kay Lim Construction &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v Soon Douglas (Pte) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2013] 1 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Kay Lim</span>”), for instance, the defendant (“Soon Douglas”) was found liable to the plaintiff (“Kay Lim”) under a contract for the rental of tower cranes. Soon Douglas had failed to provide properly skilled and qualified labour to dismantle and remove the cranes, causing the death of one worker and injury to three others. The contract contained an indemnity clause which provided that Kay Lim was to indemnify Soon Douglas against all loss arising from, among others, any injury suffered by “any person” from the removal or dismantling of the cranes. Soon Douglas sought to rely on this indemnity to avoid its liability to Kay Lim. It contended that the ambit of the clause covered the claims made by Kay Lim against it – there was no ambiguity in the phrase “any person” and it included Kay Lim making a claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>Quentin Loh J rejected this argument. He found that, while the phrase “any person” was, taken by itself, literally broad enough to include Kay Lim, it was inherently improbable, and indeed bordering on commercial absurdity, that Kay Lim would have agreed to the circular obligation of indemnifying Soon Douglas for any claims brought <span class="font-italic">by Kay Lim</span> for loss and damage suffered as a result of <span class="font-italic">Soon Douglas’s breach of contract</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [45]). He also stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 … The Court of Appeal reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 195 at [52], that it is trite law that exemption clauses are to be construed strictly and if a party seeks to exclude or limit his liability, he must do so in clear words. … The related <span class="font-italic">contra proferentum</span> rule that “contractual provisions should prima facie be construed against the party who was responsible for the preparation of the contract and/or who is to benefit from the provision” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Hobhouse J in <span class="font-italic">E E Caledonia Ltd v Orbit Valve Co Europe</span> [1994] 1 WLR 221 at 227) also applies to exemption clauses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 These principles of construction are equally relevant to the construction of indemnity clauses. … The courts will therefore start, and I emphasise the word “start”, with a similar presumption that parties are unlikely to have agreed to bear the liability for the acts of another unless set out in clear and unequivocal terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span><span class="font-italic">Kay Lim </span>does suggest that, in so far as there is any ambiguity, Clause 12.1 should be construed in favour of the defendants. That said, I am fully cognisant that the scope of the clause is ultimately a matter of interpretation which cannot be determined by any automatic rule of law or single canon of interpretation (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Lim </span>at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Text of Clause 12 and the CBSAs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>I now start with the text of the indemnity clause. Clause 12.1 states that the losses covered by the indemnity include “<span class="font-italic">any… losses</span>” caused by “<span class="font-italic">any breach</span> or alleged breach of any term or condition of this Agreement” [emphasis added]. Hence, on its face, it does appear to be an unlimited and general indemnity which would cover Polimet’s failure to make repayments in breach of Clause 11.1(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>Against this, the Initial Shareholders submit that Clause 12.1 has to be construed in the context of the rest of Clause 12, particularly Clauses 12.2 and 12.3, which they say make clear that Clause 12.1 was intended to be an indemnity against third party claims. These clauses read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12.2 <span class="font-weight-bold">Conduct of Defence: </span>If any action, proceeding, claim or demand … <span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>shall be instituted involving any of the Indemnified Parties in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Clause 12.1, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Shareholders in writing and the Issuer and the Initial Shareholders shall, unless the Indemnified Party elects to assume the defence itself, assume the defence thereof … and shall be liable to pay the fees and expenses of such lawyers related to such proceeding. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12.3 <span class="font-weight-bold">Defence by Indemnified Person: </span>In any proceeding, pursuant to Clause 12.2, if the Indemnified Person has elected to assume the defence itself or the Issuer has and the Initial Shareholders have failed to appoint lawyers satisfactory to the Indemnified Person within a reasonable time, the Issuer and the Initial Shareholders shall reimburse such fees and expenses as are incurred by the Indemnified Person. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>I agree that whether an indemnity clause does in fact cover a particular type of loss or liability must be construed in the light of the other provisions of the contract (see <span class="font-italic">Kay Lim </span>at [40]). However I am of the view that Clause 12.1 is not limited to third party claims. First, while Clauses 12.2 and 12.3 indicate that third party claims fall within the scope of Clause 12.1, they do not limit Clause 12.1 <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. The Initial Shareholders themselves accept this.

</div>
</div>
</div> Instead, Clauses 12.2 and 12.3 deal with distinct matters such as determining which party assumes the defence in the event of an action commenced against the plaintiff and the circumstances in which the defendants are to reimburse the plaintiff if the latter assumes the defence itself. Clause 12.1, by contrast, is labelled a “General Indemnity” – this clearly indicates that third party claims are merely a sub-set of the types of losses which fall within its scope.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>Second, the ambit of Clause 12.1 is very wide. It is an indemnity against not just “claims”, “damages”, “costs” and so on, but also “losses” and “deficiencies” – the last two of which do not necessarily presuppose a third party claim. The clause also expressly incorporates losses, deficiencies, and so on caused to the plaintiff “for any short-fall, depletion or diminution in value of the assets of” Polimet or the Group Companies resulting from “any breach of the representations, warranties, undertaking and covenants given by the Initial Shareholders”. This is a type of loss which would ordinarily be directly suffered by the plaintiff rather than flowing from or even resulting in a third party claim. For instance, a third party may not necessarily be concerned with, let alone bring a claim against the plaintiff for, a deficiency in the value of Polimet’s assets. These features of Clause 12.1 distinguish this case from <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782, which the Initial Shareholders rely on. In that case, the relevant clause necessarily presupposed liability incurred by the indemnified party to a third party (at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>Even if Clause 12.1 is a general indemnity clause, the key issue remains whether it was intended by the parties to make the Initial Shareholders liable for losses arising from Polimet’s default for non-payment – in other words, whether it was intended to grant the plaintiff recourse to the Initial Shareholders for Polimet’s debts. On this issue, the text of Clause 12.1 and the rest of the CBSAs is, at the very least, equivocal. In fact, it seems to go against the plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>First, if Clause 12.1 was to operate as an indemnity to cover Polimet’s default then it is strange that there is no reference in the clause to Polimet’s obligations to make repayment. In an indemnity agreement under which the indemnifier undertakes primary liability for the debts of another, it would invariably be made clear that this is the object of the agreement (see, for example, the clause in <span class="font-italic">Scottish Amicable </span>quoted at [70] above). In such an indemnity, it would also be odd, and indeed illogical, to find the principal debtor – Polimet in this case – named as an indemnifier for <span class="font-italic">its own debts</span>. However, this is the case here as Polimet is identified as one of the parties to Clause 12.1 even though it is already liable to repay the full redemption amounts under the other terms of the CBSAs, particularly Clause 11.1 (see [85] below). In addition, there will typically be other provisions specifying whether the indemnity is limited or unlimited, whether a demand is necessary for payment, and so forth. None of these details are contained in Clause 12. This is despite the fact that Clause 12.1 does specifically deal with losses arising from any short-fall, depletion or diminution in value of the assets of Polimet or the Group Companies, while Clauses 12.2 and 12.3 focus on the steps to be taken in relation to third party claims. The omission is glaring. If Clause 12.1 was intended to cover Polimet’s default, then this would have been the most important category of breach falling within the ambit of the clause, both in terms of commercial significance and quantum; yet it was not made express.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>Next, the provisions on repayment, such as Clauses 2.5, 4.1, 5.1 and 11, indicate that only the Issuer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Polimet) is under obligation under the CBSAs to repay the full redemption amounts. In particular, Clause 11 – which sets out the procedure to be followed upon an event of default – suggests that the plaintiff’s recourse <span class="font-italic">under the CBSAs</span> for any amount which is then “due and payable” is only against the “Issuer”. The material portions of Clause 11 are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. DEFAULT</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.1 If:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Non-payment:</span> any Security Party fails to pay to the Bondholder any amount due and payable … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">then the Bondholder may, by <span class="font-italic">notice to the Issuer</span>, declare the Bond to be immediately due and payable and the Facility to be cancelled, whereupon:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) (where the Drawing has been made) the Facility shall be cancelled, and <span class="font-italic">the Issuer shall pay to the Bondholder</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the total sum of all the Redemption Amounts as stated in Schedule 2;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) accrued interest on the Principal Amount as at the date of the cancellation; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) all other sums which have accrued or are due and <span class="font-italic">payable by the Issuer</span> to the Bondholder under this Agreement and the Security Documents as at the date of the cancellation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.4 For the avoidance of doubt, any determination or notification by the Bondholder concerning all payments referred to in this Clause shall in the absence of manifest error be conclusive evidence of the matter and <span class="font-italic">shall be binding on the Issuer</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span> There is no mention of the Initial Shareholders. The plaintiff argues that that Clause 11.1 is not intended to exhaustively spell out the remedies that the plaintiff may exercise upon an event of default. This is right in that Clause 11 does not prevent the plaintiff from enforcing its rights under the other security documents such as the PGs and Deeds of Debenture. However, as far as the CBSAs are concerned, there is no indication that the specific procedure set out in Clause 11 must be read together with Clause 12.1.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>Hence, even just based on the text of the CBSAs, it does not appear that Clause 12.1 was intended to impose personal liability on the Initial Shareholders for all the sums owing by Polimet. At the very least, there is ambiguity on the issue. This makes the relevant context, which is the subject matter of the next section, important. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>For completeness, I note that the plaintiff also referred me to the indemnity provisions in the other contractual documents, namely the Deeds of Debenture and the Subscription Option Agreement. I did not derive much assistance from these clauses. While they arguably bolster the plaintiff’s argument that Clause 12.1 is not restricted to third party claims, they do not shed any additional light on the ambit of Clause 12.1 given my finding that it is a general indemnity provision.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>I now move on to the relevant context. While the parties have adduced a great deal of evidence in relation to what transpired both before and after the execution of the CBSAs, I must emphasise that the court can only take into account the facts necessary to establish the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties at the time of the contract (see [66] above).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Admissibility of extrinsic evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>A preliminary issue is the admissibility of the extrinsic evidence which has been tendered. This issue arises because of the parol evidence rule, which survives in Singapore law through s 94 of the Evidence Act. As the Court of Appeal noted in the seminal case of <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>, this is a rule of evidence which operates where the contract was intended by the parties to contain all the terms of the agreement (at [112]). This requirement is clearly satisfied here due to Clause 14.1 of the CBSAs, the entire agreement clause. Hence, no extrinsic evidence is admissible “to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from” the terms of the CBSAs (see s 94 of the Evidence Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>Having said that, extrinsic evidence is admissible under proviso (<span class="font-italic">f</span>) to s 94 to aid in the <span class="font-italic">interpretation </span>of written words. In the words of the Court of Appeal, such evidence can be used to <span class="font-italic">explain and illuminate </span>the written words, but <span class="font-italic">not to contradict or vary them</span> (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [132(f)]). This is a fine but important distinction. In addition, and notwithstanding my finding that the language of Clause 12.1 is unclear, ambiguity is not a prerequisite for the operation of proviso (<span class="font-italic">f</span>). The extrinsic evidence, however, must be: (a) relevant; (b) reasonably available to all the contracting parties; and (c) relate to a clear or obvious context. Apart from these three requirements, there is no strict rule that evidence of prior negotiations or of the parties’ subsequent conduct cannot be admitted, although the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>noted that the position in relation to evidence of subsequent conduct may require fuller scrutiny in the future (at [132(c)] and [132(d)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>In the present matter, given the ambiguity surrounding the language of Clause 12, there is no real risk that the extrinsic evidence would lead to the court to contradict or vary the written words. This is a case where illumination is required. The extrinsic evidence tendered by the parties for this purpose can be placed into two broad categories. First, there is the evidence of the pre-contractual negotiations between the parties including the Term Sheets, the discussions in August 2007 and the Salzburg meeting in September 2007. Second, there is the evidence of the parties’ conduct subsequent to execution of the 2007 and 2008 CBSAs (see [23] to [28] above). In my view, both categories of evidence are admissible and fulfil the requirements set down in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>For a start, the evidence is relevant as it directly relates to the terms of the CBSAs and the commercial bargain between the parties. While it is true that the Term Sheets and pre-contractual negotiations, for instance, do not represent the final position agreed upon, they are nevertheless objective evidence which shed light on the common assumptions held by the parties when they were negotiating the CBSAs. These assumptions would have necessarily influenced them when they ultimately executed the CBSAs. The evidence of the parties’ subsequent conduct is of less relevance. But I accept that their post-contractual conduct may show what they would have reasonably known and intended <span class="font-italic">at the time of the contract</span>. Second, the evidence of the discussions and meetings between the parties, both prior to and after the execution of the CBSAs, would necessarily have been available to all the contracting parties. The last requirement is that the evidence must relate to a clear or obvious context. Here, the plaintiff argues that the evidence of the pre-contractual discussions and meetings should not be admitted as the facts are patently unclear. This is true in relation to the purported 7 August 2007 meeting and the First and Second Oral Agreements, of which there is insufficient evidence. But there is no reason why the other pre-contractual evidence, such as the Term Sheets, the telephone and email discussions between KC and Lee on the PGs in August 2007 and the Salzburg meeting, should be excluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>This is not to say that the different items of extrinsic evidence, though admissible, are of equal relevance. Their impact on the interpretation to be given to Clause 12.1 is a separate issue, to which I now turn.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Term Sheets and discussions in August 2007</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>Starting with Term Sheet 1, it was merely a draft which set out the indicative terms of the investment, and did not represent the final and detailed position between the parties. Various amendments were then made which led to the Final Term Sheet, particularly the revision of the PG clause to make it clear that only Lee and Ho will provide PGs based on their initial shareholding of 50% in Polimet. Both Term Sheet 1 and the Final Term Sheet also referred to an indemnity to be provided by Polimet as the “Investee”. But it is common ground that neither party discussed the indemnity clause until the Salzburg meeting in September, which took place after the Final Term Sheet was signed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>Similarly, the evidence relating to the 3 August 2007 telephone conversation (see [50] to [52] above) and the emails of 3 and 8 August 2007 sent by Lee to Chia (see [51] and [55] above) indicates that the parties did not apply their minds to the indemnity clause at the negotiation stage, although they were particularly concerned about the PGs. Hence what the evidence of the Term Sheets and the August 2007 discussions reveals is that Lee, Ho and Ong were worried about their personal liability and therefore focussed on the PGs. They did not discuss the indemnity clause because they appear to have assumed that the PGs and their personal liability under the investment were coterminous. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>In one sense, this assumption was clearly wrong. As both Ong and Lee conceded,

</div> the Initial Shareholders had various personal liabilities under the CBSAs. These included an obligation to provide an additional cash injection of US$500,000 as working capital if the dumet manufacturing line was not fully operational by a certain date (Clause 9.2(xxvii)). They also gave warranties and made representations relating to the Group Companies’ business, assets, accounts and so forth (Clause 7 and Schedule 3). Finally, there is Clause 12 under which the Initial Shareholders were all jointly and severally liable for, at the very least, losses caused by third party claims. Thus it is apparent that the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability under the investment was not limited to the loss of their shares in Polimet.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>On the other hand, it appears that what the Initial Shareholders were concerned with, quite naturally, was the personal consequences to them if there was <span class="font-italic">default</span> on the sizeable loan to be disbursed by KC to Polimet. On this, I have already rejected the Initial Shareholder’s contention that there were oral agreements between the parties that, if Polimet defaulted, the Initial Shareholders would only lose their shares and be personally liable to the extent of any PGs granted by them (see [56] and [60] above). Nevertheless, this was clearly the assumption on which the Initial Shareholders operated, at least until the Salzburg meeting. The question is whether this was a purely subjective belief which the Initial Shareholders held or was one which both<span class="font-italic"> </span>parties shared. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>Considering the evidence, my view is that when the Final Term Sheet was signed, both parties were operating under the <span class="font-italic">common </span>assumption that, if Polimet defaulted, the plaintiff’s only recourse against the Initial Shareholders personally would be under the PGs provided by Lee and Ho. This is why both sides focussed their negotiations on the PGs and never applied their minds to the indemnity clause. It is also why, as Chia knew, Ho was reluctant to provide a PG for 100% of Polimet’s liabilities and needed to be persuaded to do so. Indeed, the same assumption would have been shared by any reasonable business person who was at that point in time privy to the objective communications between KC and Lee leading up to the Final Term Sheet.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Salzburg meeting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>Hence the evidence of the Salzburg meeting is important. It was the first and indeed only time Clause 12 was specifically discussed before the execution of the 2007 CBSA. Lee admitted that Chia went through with her the main clauses of a draft of the 2007 CBSA, including Clause 12. She however prevaricated on the issue of what exactly Chia told her about the scope and nature of Clause 12. Initially, she claimed that Chia had represented to her that Clause 12 was merely a third party indemnity clause.

</div> Crucially though, Chia did not assert that either he or Lee specifically considered, let alone discussed, the possibility that Clause 12.1 was broad enough to make the Initial Shareholders personally liable for all the sums which were to be disbursed to Polimet. In this respect, Chia’s evidence is equivocal. It appears that, apart from Chia reading out and going through what Clause 12.1 says on its face, there was no real discussion as to its scope. Indeed, if Chia had informed Lee, at the Salzburg meeting, that the Initial Shareholders would be personally liable for all the sum which were to be disbursed to Polimet, I would have no doubt that the Initial Shareholders would not have proceeded with signing the CBSAs (see [105] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">102 </span>The evidence of the Salzburg meeting therefore supports the Initial Shareholders’ case that neither party attached any significant weight to Clause 12.1. They did not consider its impact on the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability in the event of Polimet’s default and were still operating under the common assumption that it was the PGs which mattered in this regard. As Chia told the court, the main purpose of the Salzburg meeting was for him to walk through the relevant draft documents with Lee and to assure her that they “capture[d] the same substance” set out in the Final Term Sheet.

</div> In other words, neither party considered Clause 12.1 as altering the commercial bargain between them.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Execution of 2007 and 2008 CBSAs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">103 </span>For completeness, I note that the actual execution of the 2007 CBSA was unremarkable. It is clear that the Initial Shareholders did not go through the legal documents in any detail when they signed them. Certainly, there was no specific discussion on Clause 12. The same is true of the 2008 CBSAs, which were simply based on the terms of the 2007 CBSA. Hence, the facts concerning the execution of the 2007 and 2008 CBSAs do not assist me in construing Clause 12.1.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the pre-contractual negotiations and commercial context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">104 </span>The background evidence of the pre-contractual negotiations, taken as a whole, leads me to the conclusion that the parties could not have intended for Clause 12.1 to impose a personal obligation on the Initial Shareholders to indemnify the plaintiff for all the sums owing by Polimet. The fact of the matter is that neither party applied their minds to the issue when the CBSAs were executed. But if the question had been raised at the time of contract, then a reasonable business person in the parties’ shoes would have understood that Clause 12.1 was not an indemnity for Polimet’s debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">105 </span>The commercial context and the bargain between the parties must be kept in mind. A key part of this bargain was the PGs given by Lee and Ho. As KC knew, both of them were concerned about their personal liability under the investment and only agreed to grant the PGs after Chia suggested that they could be limited to Lee and Ho’s 50% shareholdings in Polimet. Having gotten this compromise, it would have made no sense for Lee and Ho to have agreed to be exposed to 100% of Polimet’s liabilities <span class="font-italic">via</span> the indemnity clause. Similarly, Ong and Yap were not directly involved in the negotiations and it is implausible that they would have agreed to participate in the investment on such onerous personal terms. Yap, in particular, had a mere 3% stake in the investment. So for him to have agreed to what, in substance, would have been an unlimited and primary obligation to repay all of Polimet’s debts in the event of its default would have been incredible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">106 </span>Next, even though Clause 4 of the PGs states that the obligations of the guarantors are “additional to, and not instead of, any obligations contained in the [other transaction documents]”,

</div> it is difficult to see what commercial reason there was for KC to have specifically required the PGs from Lee and Ho if the indemnity clause already covered a default by Polimet. Chia sought to explain that the PGs were valuable as they were a sign of commitment from Ho and Lee and allowed the plaintiff to “enforce quicker” the 50% they covered.

</div> It is true that the PGs, which contain specific provisions on payment and exclude Lee and Ho’s rights to require the plaintiffs to first exhaust its remedies against Polimet, might be easier to enforce than Clause 12.1. However I am not persuaded that the practical benefits of a limited PG over an unlimited personal indemnity were so significant as to explain the insistence of KC that Ho and Lee provide PGs. The truth, it seems to me, is that KC did not consider that Clause 12.1 applied to Polimet’s default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">107 </span>Against this, the plaintiff submits that it would not have made financial sense for KC to have participated in what was a highly risky investment with only the 50% PGs from Ho and Lee, and without any right to seek recourse against Ong, the Group Companies’ largest shareholder. According to Chia, KC was only comfortable accepting the limited PGs as they were in addition to the indemnity that it expected from the Initial Shareholders. He pointed out that the net asset position of the Group Companies at that time was a fraction of the financing sought; thus it was insufficient for KC to only hold the shares and assets of Polimet, along with the PGs, as security. Chia argued that this was especially so because the dumet business which the Group Companies wished to acquire consisted of land, machinery and other assets located in China and realising such assets would be a complex and uncertain enterprise. KC also viewed the investment with a heightened sense of risk as it was KC’s first investment in China. This line of argument seems plausible at first blush, but it faces several difficulties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">108 </span>First, it ignores the fact that this was not an ordinary loan where one would expect considerable caution from the creditor, but a mezzanine investment. It involved greater risk, but also greater potential reward. KC had the option to subscribe for the shares of Polimet and would have directly profited if the business had taken off. As Chia testified, KC’s investments are based on the growth potential of a company.

</div> Second, the interests, fees and redemption amounts for the loan of US$5.5m were considerable. So KC was adequately compensated for the risk it took. Third, it is not as if KC did not have any security. They had the PGs and securities over the assets and shares of Polimet. Finally, and crucially, even if it would have made commercial sense for KC to have obtained a full indemnity from all the Initial Shareholders, particularly Ong, to cover Polimet’s debts, there is no actual evidence that this was the object of Clause 12.1. In fact, the evidence suggests that the plaintiff’s argument that the indemnity was central to the risk allocation between the parties is an afterthought. The only contemporaneous negotiations on the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability in the event of Polimet’s default were focused on the PGs, and the indemnity clause was never discussed in any detail. Thus I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s submission that the commercial context of the case is in their favour.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Post-contractual conduct after the execution of the CBSAs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">109 </span>I derived much less assistance from the evidence of the parties’ conduct subsequent to the execution of the CBSAs.

</div> This claim is not made out. As I noted earlier, under the terms of the CBSAs, only the Issuer is under obligation to repay the full redemption amounts <span class="font-italic">pursuant to </span><span class="font-italic">the Payment Schedule</span> (see [85] above). Insofar as Preamble B suggests that the Initial Shareholders have a similar obligation, it is clearly wrong. Next, the preamble makes no reference to the indemnity clause. So it cannot be construed as a clear and equivocal representation by the Initial Shareholders that they were liable to repay the redemption amounts under Clause 12.1. Thus there can be no estoppel either. In my view, the language of Preamble B is at best a neutral factor. It fails to assist the plaintiff.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>There are then the facts surrounding the Proposed 2011 CBSA and the legal advice of Yip HW of Richard Wee &amp; Yip on the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability under the CBSAs (see [24] and [25] above).

That was when Ong – or for that matter any of the parties – first considered the possibility that the Initial Shareholders might be held personally liable for Polimet’s debts <span class="font-italic">under the CBSAs</span> rather than the PGs. The fact that Ong and Lee subsequently sought legal advice on this issue and abandoned the Proposed 2011 CBSA after being unable to get a “straightforward” answer from Yip HW, who issued his equivocal legal advice on Chia’s instructions,

That was almost five years after the time of contract and, unsurprisingly, these items of extrinsic evidence are of limited utility. Starting with the letters of demand which were sent in 2012 (see [26] above), not much can be inferred from the fact that they named all five defendants, including Ong and Yap, who did not respond. The letters also do not make any reference to Clause 12.1. In addition, the Initial Shareholders’ failure to respond or object to them is understandable as the parties were still in negotiations during that period of time and looking for a possible “white knight” investor to rescue Polimet.

Ong testified that Chia reassured him at this meeting that Ong’s liability was limited to the loss of his shares and nothing more. This is difficult to accept given my finding that there never was any oral agreement between the parties to this effect. In addition, KC had already sold the plaintiff to GDAF by then, so there was no reason for Chia to go out on a limb and make such a representation. Hence I do not accept that what transpired at the meeting supports the Initial Shareholders’ case.

This was after the plaintiff’s solicitors had issued two demands earlier in the same month, the first dated 15 August 2013 to the defendants to cancel the CBSAs and to demand payment, and the second dated 20 August 2013 to Lee and Ho to demand payment pursuant to their PGs.

I do not place any weight on this evidence. Clause 12.1 was not discussed in the correspondence or brought to Soong’s attention.

</div>
</div> I find that unilateral mistake does not apply to the present case, although it is arguable that the parties entered into the CBSAs under a common mistake as to the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability in the event of Polimet’s default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span>Before I set out my analysis of both types of mistake, it must be kept in mind that these are alternative defences which presuppose that Clause 12.1 is broad enough to cover losses arising from Polimet’s default. The Initial Shareholders argue that, even if this was the case, the plaintiff’s claim should still fail because they made a mistake as to the meaning and effect of Clause 12.1 of which the plaintiff was aware (unilateral mistake) or that was made by both parties (common mistake).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span>The defence of unilateral mistake can be easily dismissed. Even if the Initial Shareholders had been mistaken about the scope of Clause 12.1, and assuming that this mistake was sufficiently important or fundamental (see <span class="font-italic">Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502 at [34] (“<span class="font-italic">Digilandmall</span>”)), there is no indication that Chia or Yeo would have known of the mistake at the time of contract. As I found earlier, neither party applied their minds to the scope of Clause 12.1 until well after the execution of the CBSAs. While Chia knew that Clause 12.1 was a general indemnity, he had not considered the possibility that it was broad enough to be enforced as an unlimited personal indemnity against the Initial Shareholders for all the sums owing by Polimet. This is the reason why there were no serious discussions on the indemnity clause during the course of negotiations. Thus, not having considered the matter themselves, Chia and Yeo could not have known of the Initial Shareholders’ purported mistake at the time the CBSAs were executed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>It is less clear if the doctrine of common mistake applies. On the one hand, I have found that neither party applied their minds to Clause 12.1 until well after the execution of the CBSAs and that there were no firm oral agreements on the Initial Shareholders’ personal liability under the investment. This supports the plaintiff’s position that neither of them could have been mistaken about the nature and effect of Clause 12.1. At the same time, the evidence suggests that the parties, at the time of negotiations, were operating under a common assumption that, if Polimet defaulted, the Initial Shareholders would only be personally liable to the extent of any PGs granted by them, if any (see [98] and [99] above). Therefore, and assuming that Clause 12.1 is broad enough to cover losses arising from Polimet’s default, the parties’ assumption would have been wrong and they would have entered into the CBSAs under a common mistake as to Clause 12.1’s “effect on the [Initial Shareholders’] liability under the 2007 CBSA”, as pleaded by the defendants.

In the latter case, it was held that there is no equitable jurisdiction to grant remedy for common mistake in circumstances which fall short of those in which the common law held a contract void (at [126]).

Hence, it is certainly arguable that the common mistake made by the parties – as to the effect of Clause 12.1 on the Initial Shareholders’ liability under the CBSAs in the event of Polimet’s default – is sufficient to warrant the equitable remedy of rectification sought by the Initial Shareholders (albeit not on the exact terms which they seek).

The applicable principles were recently examined by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">iTronic Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Swee Leon and another suit </span>[2016] 3 SLR 663 (“<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>In essence, the question is whether the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in comparison with the greatest that could conceivable be proved to have followed from the breach (<span class="font-italic">Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage and Motor Co Ltd</span> [1915] AC 79<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 87). This test is qualified by the “strong initial presumption” that that the parties themselves are the best judges of what is legitimate in a provision dealing with the consequences of breach in a negotiated contract between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power (<span class="font-italic">iTronic </span>at [177] relying on the landmark UK Supreme Court case of <span class="font-italic">Cavendish Squ</span><span class="font-italic">are Holding BV v Makdessi</span> [2016] AC 1172). As was observed in <span class="font-italic">iTronic</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [177]), it is not for the courts to relieve a party from the consequences of what may prove to be an onerous or possibly even a commercially imprudent bargain. Thus, a clause will not become a penalty simply because it results in overpayment in particular circumstances and the parties are allowed a generous margin to determine the agreed damages to be payable upon breach (<span class="font-italic">iTronic</span> at [176] and [177]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">126 </span>Applying these principles to this case, it is clear that Clause 5.5 does not contravene the penalty doctrine. First, the defendants have not really adduced any evidence to show that the default interest rate of 2% per month is out of line with that imposed in comparable loans of such a nature. While they submit that it is “common knowledge” that the returns on bond subscriptions in the open market would range between 3% to 6% per annum,

</div> this assertion is unsubstantiated by any material. It is unclear to me what kind of bond subscriptions the defendants are referring to, particularly whether they are comparable to the CBSAs. The plaintiff, by contrast, adduced unchallenged evidence that private equity funds, similar to mezzanine funds such as KC, typically target an internal rate of return (“IRR”) of between 20% and 25%.

</div> Thus Polimet’s default deprived KC of the opportunity to deploy the funds for other investments which could conceivably have generated such annualised returns. The plaintiff also relied on statutory guidelines which stipulate that late interest charged under a licensed business loan will only be considered “unconscionable or substantially unfair” if it exceeds a rate of 4% per month (see r 11(1) of the Moneylenders Rules 2009 read with s 23(6) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed)). While the CBSAs may not fall within the scope of these guidelines, they are a further indication that the default interest rate of 2% per month is not extravagant and unconscionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">127 </span>Just as crucially, the defendants have not rebutted the “strong initial presumption” which applies to negotiated contracts between properly advised parties of comparable bargaining power. There is no dispute that the terms of the CBSAs were specifically negotiated. The Initial Shareholders were advised by AFG and Chua, and the commercial terms of the CBSAs were not unilaterally imposed by KC. For instance, the coupon rate was lowered upon Lee’s specific request and she had the full opportunity to review the terms of the 2007 CBSA when the drafts were presented to her. So, even if the default interest rate is high, this is not a case where the court ought to intervene. In such circumstances, I find that Clause 5.5 is valid and enforceable.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>In conclusion, these are my findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff’s claim against the Initial Shareholders for the outstanding sums owing by Polimet under Clause 12.1 of the CBSAs is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Against the defendants, I find that the default interest provided for under Clause 5.5 of the CBSAs is valid and enforceable. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third party claim against Chia and Yeo is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">129 </span>I now invite the parties to make their submissions on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><br/></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hri Kumar Nair, SC, Shivani d/o Sivasagthy Retnam, Tan Ben Mathias and Zhao Liwen Constance (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff and third parties;<br/>Tan Chee Meng, SC, Sngeeta Rai and Lim Xian Yong Alvin (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
