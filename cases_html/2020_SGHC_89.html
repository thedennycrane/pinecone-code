These are four companies whose shares are held by the Plaintiffs as well as the 1st and the 2nd Defendants.  In the alternative, the Plaintiffs asked for an order for the buy-out of their shares in the four companies “on terms to the satisfaction of the Court”.

The residue of his estate – including shares in the Companies – was given to the Sisters “in equal shares absolutely”.  Mother and the three other siblings did not receive any shares of the Companies under Father’s will.  The Sisters were appointed as the trustees and executors of Father’s will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It will be seen that after Father’s death, the Sisters each hold 25% of the shares in each company, subject to the following minor differences.  In TBL, Doreen holds one more share than the other Sisters; and in YP, Doreen and Blossom each hold one share more than Ivy and July.  These differences in the TBL and YP shareholdings came about through the following events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In the case of TBL, the company has an odd number of shares in TBL (4,261 shares).  After 1,065 shares were apportioned to each sister, the extra share ended up with Doreen.  It is Blossom’s and Ivy’s case that Doreen had represented to them that ownership in the extra TBL share could not be divided between shareholders; and that on the basis that each sister would have an equal one-quarter share in the extra TBL share, they  had “entrusted” Doreen with their respective one-quarter shares for her to hold on their behalf.

</div>  It is Doreen’s and Julie’s case that Blossom, Ivy and Julie had unanimously and unconditionally agreed to let Doreen have the extra TBL share because she was the eldest sibling.  According to Doreen and Julie, there was never any understanding or agreement that each sister would own a one-quarter interest in this extra TBL share: Doreen has at all material times been (and continues to be) the sole legal and beneficial owner of the extra TBL share.

</div>  As to why they became directors of the Companies, Blossom and Ivy had a different version of events from that put forward by Doreen and Julie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 While there were varying accounts among the Sisters as to how the Companies’ affairs were managed post 17 June 2003, broadly speaking it was not disputed that in the immediate aftermath of Father’s death in April 2003, Julie was the only one of the four Sisters who worked fulltime in CCM (the company providing management services to the three property-owning companies).  At that point, Doreen was an academic who split her time between Singapore and Australia; Ivy resided primarily in Malaysia and also Australia; and Blossom, whilst based in Singapore, was then in fulltime employment with Hewlett-Packard (although at trial she alleged that even whilst employed by Hewlett-Packard, she had spent a portion of her time working in the CCM office).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In 2004, Doreen gave up her academic position in order to work alongside Julie in CCM.  In February 2010, Julie took a leave of absence from CCM which lasted till August 2010.  Sometime in 2010, following Julie’s decision to go on a leave of absence, Doreen invited Blossom to join her in working in CCM, and Blossom agreed.  When Julie returned to work in August 2010, Blossom had already started working fulltime in CCM; and she continued to do so until her resignation on 28 July 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Throughout these proceedings, Doreen and Julie have used the term “working directors” to describe their positions in CCM.

It was also not disputed that she continued to do so after her return from Australia to Singapore in 2012.  Ivy herself has alleged that she was “generally prepared to leave the day to day handling of Singapore business operations to the other Sisters (which concerned Singapore properties), but … expected to be kept abreast on all matters pertaining to the Companies”.

Julie asserted that the other three Sisters had agreed to the properties being sold to her at this price, but Ivy – who was responsible for the sale arrangements – had then changed her mind and asked Julie to “match the price of RM 2.7 million”.

Since Julie herself was a party to the agreement and could not sign the agreement as CCH’s representative, Blossom’s refusal to co-sign meant that Doreen had to fly back from Australia to co-sign together with Ivy; and this also had to be done in a rush by 31 December 2013, before a new capital gains tax came into effect on 1 Jan 2014.  Blossom, for her part, maintained that Julie had “concealed” her intention to make Alan a co-purchaser when she first made an offer for the JB Properties; and that by including Alan, Julie had contradicted her own avowed intention to purchase the JB Properties “to preserve … Father’s legacy”.

CCM had been serving as the managing agent for the RV Building, but in the period following 28 July 2016, CCM’s service agreement with MCST 325 was terminated.  A new managing agent was subsequently appointed.  The two sides blamed each other for the termination.  Blossom and Ivy also claimed that Doreen and Ivy made other allegedly nefarious moves such as writing to question Blossom’s engagement of an unlicensed contractor to address serious spalling concrete issues at the RV Building;

At the directors’ meeting in January 2017, for example, Doreen had requested that Alan be appointed as her alternate director when she was unable to attend due to an urgent medical appointment.  The request was not acceded to by Blossom and Ivy.  On 15 February 2017, Doreen informed them that Alan had been appointed as a “Management Consultant / Advisor” to the Companies.

Blossom and Ivy charged that their approval was required for any salary increase, and that this particular increase was “unauthorised” because Doreen and Julie had effected it without their prior approval.  Although Doreen explained that the increase in Julie’s salary was “to be expected” in view of her having to step in to “helm the business” after Blossom’s sudden resignation, both Blossom and Ivy refused to accept the explanation;

</div> and the issue of Julie’s salary increase remained a point of contention between the two sides.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The sense of grievance which Blossom and Ivy professed to feel about the “unauthorised” payments to Julie was aggravated by their discovery that Alan’s company Goodstar Developments (S) Pte Ltd (“Goodstar”) was being paid $4,280 for Alan’s management consultancy services, as well as by the Sisters’ disagreement over the issue of dividends.  In respect of this latter issue, Doreen and Julie had taken the view that CCH and TP – which owned all the units in the RV Building – needed to conserve cash for all the repairs needed to the building.  As such, CCH and YP had not paid out dividends from 2016 and 2014 respectively (It is not disputed that TBL continued to pay dividends throughout the same period, though Blossom and Ivy have complained that the amount of dividends paid has decreased.).  Blossom and Ivy were upset about this, particularly since Julie’s salary increase in CCM was effected after the halt to dividend payments by CCH and YP.

This offer was not taken up by Blossom: a reply sent by Ivy on behalf of Blossom and Ivy herself  raised objections to a number of things, from Doreen’s use of to a “common email address” (ccm2012@singnet.com.sg) to send her 25 August 2017 email, to the perceived “insinuation” that Blossom had “not been performing her responsibilities as a director”.  Another attempt was made by Doreen on 7 September 2017 to invite Blossom back to CCM to “helm” the company as a working director; and Doreen also proposed that she and Julie leave their positions as working directors to “pave the way” for Blossom.

Alan ended up renting a room in the office from 2003 to 2011, and “[lending] his business experience and acumen to CCM’s operations on an ad hoc basis” – a fact which Blossom and Ivy were always aware of and raised no objections to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In 2004, as Julie was expecting another child, Doreen resigned from her academic position at National University of Singapore (“NUS”) to join CCM fulltime as its second working director.  Neither Blossom nor Ivy was interested in becoming a working director at that juncture.  Blossom was content to take no part in the management of the Companies and to focus instead on her job at Hewlett-Packard.  Ivy was then living in Malaysia; and although she agreed to help oversee CCH’s Malaysian properties, the actual management of these properties was conducted by third party local representatives in Malaysia, with any administrative work being done back in the office in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In or around May 2009, Julie had thoughts of resigning her directorships.

</div>  In the end, Julie did not resign – but in early 2010, she decided to go on a leave of absence.  As the sole working director in CCM at that point, Doreen became concerned that she would be unable to manage things by herself.  She therefore invited Blossom to join her in working in CCM.  Blossom was initially reluctant to do so but eventually agreed; and Doreen suggested that she look after the administrative and personnel matters in CCM.

Doreen and Julie did not dispute that the relationship between them and Blossom – and the relationship between them and Ivy – became increasingly strained from around this time onwards.  They attributed the cause to Blossom’s and Ivy’s behaviour.  In particular, both of them decried what they perceived as Blossom’s “high-handed approach in relation to the business and staff in CCM”.

Blossom would also get the staff to pass Julie cheques to co-sign.  According to Julie, there were occasions when as a matter of prudence, she needed to seek clarification about the payments before signing the cheques – and yet when she tried to raise questions about certain cheques at a meeting, Blossom had simply stormed out of the meeting.

This drew the ire of Blossom and Ivy, which in turn led to Mother approaching Julie to ask her to give up the room so that Blossom and Ivy could turn it into a “meeting room for general usage”.  Eventually, it was decided that an area in the open office would be partitioned off to create both a meeting room and a room for Julie – but although the matter seemed to have been resolved, tension between the Sisters continued to simmer.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The sale of the JB Properties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As with Blossom and Ivy, so too with Doreen and Julie, the sale of the JB Properties and the abortive sale of the Melaka Properties were two key flashpoints.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In respect of the JB Properties, Julie testified that as early as August 2013, she had expressed her interest in buying these properties in order to have something to remember Father by.

This unhappy state of affairs, according to Doreen and Julie, was due to Blossom’s and Ivy’s unreasonable behaviour.  For example, Julie asserted that the decline in revenue from the RV Building over the years was wholly the doing of Blossom and Ivy.  She noted that as the Council members of MCST 325, Blossom and Ivy had ignored her feedback on the deteriorating condition of the RV Building and refused to carry out repairs.  This aggravated the already poor condition of the building.  There were fewer and fewer units in good condition to be tenanted out – which led in turn to a decline in the revenue generated from the RV Building.

It will be remembered that Blossom and Ivy had alleged that it was Alan who was actively pushing for an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale of the Properties at the meetings.  Alan had a different account of the two meetings.  According to Alan, at the first meeting, Blossom had once again put forward the proposal for a share swap among the Sisters, whereas Ivy had proposed the sale of the RV Building.  No agreement was reached at this first meeting.  Nor was any agreement reached at the second meeting, as Blossom continued to press for a share swap and Ivy for the sale of the RV Building.  Vincent suggested that Alan could proceed with the share swap on Doreen’s behalf since he held her POA, and Blossom agreed with his suggestion.  When Alan replied that it would not be correct for him to proceed with a share swap without consulting Doreen, Blossom left the meeting in a huff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 On 28 July 2016, less than a week after the second meeting, the company secretary Jenny Tang resigned.  On the same day, Blossom tendered her resignation as “an employee” of CCM “with immediate effect”, whilst Ivy too wrote to the other Sisters announcing her “retirement” from “involvement in the Singapore operations”.  This spate of resignations, all on the same day, meant that the AGMs could no longer be held on the rescheduled date of 29 July 2016.  Doreen and Julie believed that Blossom and Ivy had “engineered” this train of events with the intention of creating “more trouble” and thereby getting their own way.  According to Doreen and Julie, it was no coincidence that Jenny Tang was employed by a company called Comwell which was “owned or controlled” by Blossom’s brother-in-law.

This included what Doreen and Julie described as their “high-handed” treatment of the staff – including, for example, an ugly incident in August 2016 in which Blossom had gotten the elderly Chua to accept two packages without any explanation and had also procured his signature on “the bottom of a rolled-up document”, but then rejected his request for a copy of whatever he had signed as well as his attempt to return the packages.

At the TBL AGM on 27 September 2016, when Blossom as retiring TBL director was up for re-election, Doreen and Julie took the position that it was in the “best interests of TBL” not to re-elect her.  As such, they refused to vote for her re-election.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Julie’s salary increase </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Among the various examples of Blossom’s and Ivy’s attempts to create “trouble”, the matters which appeared to draw the most antagonism from them were the increase in Julie’s salary from CCM; Alan’s involvement in the Companies; and the question of remedial works and repairs at the RV Building.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As to the former, Doreen and Julie asserted that the increase in Julie’s monthly gross salary from $2,020 to $6,000 was reasonable, given that her salary had not changed since 2011.  More importantly, Julie had needed to handle nearly the entire workload in CCM after Blossom’s and Ivy’s abrupt departure in July 2016, as Doreen was then back in Australia.  Doreen and Julie were of the view that as the only two working directors in CCM following Blossom’s and Ivy’s departure, they were empowered to decide on matters of salary adjustments without seeking the other two’s permission.  When it transpired, however, that Blossom and Ivy were using their opposition to the salary increase as the excuse for refusing to approve CCM’s audited accounts, Doreen proposed in early September 2017 that Blossom could return to CCM as a working director while she and Julie would leave their positions to “pave the way”.

After Blossom’s and Ivy’s sudden departures in July 2016, Alan had stepped in again to help Julie in the office, and he had done so without remuneration for nearly half a year.  It was only in February 2017 that Doreen and Julie decided to put things on a formal footing by having CCM enter into a contract with Alan’s company Goodstar for the provision of management consultancy services.

Goodstar was paid $4,280 monthly for Alan’s services to CCM.  Doreen and Julie found Alan’s assistance to be beneficial to the Companies: in their view, Blossom and Ivy were simply raising spurious objections when they insinuated that he could not be trusted with the Companies’ “confidential information”.

At one stage, Blossom had even engaged an unlicensed contractor (a “Mr Kam”) to repair the spalling concreate – a job which Mr Kam was unqualified to do – and had insisted that an elderly female CCM staff supervise him despite Alan offering to do so.

The need for the BCA-directed remedial works as well as the repairs to the individual units was the reason why subsequently, leases in the building were renewed on 6-month terms: these shorter leases ensured the safety of tenants by allowing Doreen and Julie to arrange for tenants to vacate the units in time for the extensive works to be conducted.

It was Julie’s evidence that all the other Sisters had raised no objections to Doreen’s suggestion; and that was why CCH and YP had not been issuing dividends since then.

Whilst Blossom and Ivy blamed Doreen and Julie for the termination of CCM’s services, Doreen and Julie had a different explanation.  They pointed out that CCM’s service agreement had no fixed term or expiry date: what was required was for MCST 325 to re-appoint CCM as managing agent at its AGM.  On 7 April 2017, however, MCST 325 wrote to CCM demanding a copy of its service agreement for the “re-appointment of [CCM] as managing agent” – and stipulating that if no written reply was received by noon on 11 April 2017, the MCST “shall conclude” that CCM wished to “terminate [its] service”.  Given the absence of any fixed term in the service agreement and given that CCM’s re-appointment had always been done without MCST 325 requiring any documentation from it, Doreen and Julie were somewhat bemused and did not respond.  They were taken aback when on 21 April 2017, MCST 325 wrote to them to say that in view of the “no-reply”, it had concluded that CCM had “decided to terminate [its] contract…as managing agent for [the MCST], effective from 1st May 2017”.

Insofar as a share swap was concerned, they noted that there had never been any agreement entered into between the Sisters – so it could not be said that they had “reneged” on a share swap.  In any event, a share swap was not a viable option because whilst Blossom favoured a share swap, such an option would have required Doreen and Julie to set aside their respective wishes: out of a desire to have something to remember Father by, Doreen wanted to keep the TBL Building and Julie wanted to keep the RV Building.

Their evidence was that at the meeting on 10 February 2017, Blossom and Ivy had indicated their willingness to sell their shares in CCH and YP – <span class="font-italic">not all their shares</span>.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In my view, having regard to the manner in which the two sides pleaded their respective cases, the issues in contention were as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Whether the Companies were a quasi-partnership or akin to a quasi-partnership, run on a relationship of mutual trust and confidence between the Sisters;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Whether this relationship between the Sisters had irretrievably broken down;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Whether the management of the Companies was deadlocked;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Whether Blossom and Ivy were trapped in the Companies; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Whether it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to wind up the Companies.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Clearly these issues were intertwined: the proposition that the Companies were a quasi-partnership or akin to one, for example, was fundamental to Blossom’s and Ivy’s argument about the breakdown of the “mutual trust and confidence” upon which the Sisters had allegedly come together to run the Companies.  I will address each of these issues in turn and explain my reasons for finding against Blossom and Ivy on these issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I start first with a summary of the applicable legal principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When the members of a company will be subject to equitable constraints on the exercise of their legal rights </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The key legal principles governing the “just and equitable” jurisdiction under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CA were laid down comprehensively by the Court of Appeal (“CoA”) in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 827 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span>”).  This was a case in which the petitioner – one of the two shareholders and directors of the company Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd (“Evenstar”) – brought an application for its winding-up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CA.  The CoA noted that the House of Lords – and in particular, Lord Wilberforce – had in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd</span> [1973] AC 360 (“<span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span>”)  given context to the concept of “just and equitable” in the former s 221(1) of the Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK) (presently s 122(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK), which is the equivalent of our s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CA); and that Singapore courts have followed <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span> in s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) cases.  The CoA noted in particular (at [29]) the following seminal passages from Lord Wilberforce’s judgement, in which he considered the circumstances in which the “just and equitable” provision would be invoked in order for equitable considerations to be superimposed on the exercise of legal rights by shareholders in a company (at 379–380):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The words [just and equitable] are a requirement of the fact that a limited company is more than a mere legal entity, with a personality in law of its own: that there is room in company law for recognition of the fact that behind it, or amongst it, there are individuals with rights, expectations and obligations <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> which are not necessarily submerged in the company structure … The “just and equitable” provision does not … entitle a party to disregard the obligation he assumes by entering a company, nor the court to dispense him from it.  It does, as equity always does, enable the court to subject the exercise of legal rights to equitable considerations, that is, of a personal character arising between the individual and another, which may make it unjust, or inequitable, to insist on legal rights, or to exercise them in a particular way.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would be impossible, and wholly undesirable, to define the circumstances in which these considerations may arise.  Certainly, the fact that a company is a small one, or a private company, is not enough … <span class="font-italic">The superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more, which typically may include one, or probably more, of the following elements: (i) an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship involving mutual confidence – this element will often be found where a pre-existing partnership has been converted into a limited company; (ii) an agreement, or understanding, that all, or some (for there may be ‘sleeping partners’) of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business; (iii) restriction upon the transfer of the members’ interest in the </span><span class="font-italic">company – so that if confidence is lost, or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is these, and analogous factors, which may bring into play the just and equitable clause, and they do so directly, through the force of the words themselves.  To refer, as so many of the cases do, to “quasi-partnership” or “in substance partnerships” may be convenient but may also be confusing.  It may be convenient because it is the law of partnership which has developed the conceptions of probity, good faith and mutual confidence, and the remedies where these are absent, which become relevant once such factors as I have mentioned are found to exist: the words “just and equitable” sums these up in the law of partnership itself.  And in many, but not necessarily all cases there has been a pre-existing partnership the obligations of which it is reasonable to suppose continue to underlie the new company structure.  But the expressions may be confusing if they obscure, or deny, the fact that the parties (possibly former partners) are now co-members in a company who have accepted in law, new obligations.  A company, however small, however domestic, is a company not a partnership or even a quasi-partnership and it is through the just and equitable clause that obligations, common to partnership relations, may come in.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The notion of unfairness at the heart of the “just and equitable” jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span>, the CoA pointed out that the exercise of the courts’ jurisdiction to superimpose equitable considerations pursuant to s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) was not limited to the three circumstances mentioned by Lord Wilberforce in his judgement.  Rather, the broad underlying principle was that (at [31]) –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the notion of unfairness lies at the heart of the “just and equitable jurisdiction in s 254(1)(i) of the CA … [T]he section does not allow a member to “exit at will”, as is plain from its express terms.  Nor does it apply to a case where the loss of trust and confidence in the other members is self-induced.  It cannot be just and equitable to wind up a company just because a minority shareholder feels aggrieved or wishes to exit at will.  However, unfairness can arise in different situations and from different kinds of conduct in different circumstances.  Cases involving management deadlock or loss of mutual trust and confidence where the “just and equitable” jurisdiction under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) has been successfully invoked can be re-characterised as cases of unfairness, whether arising from broken promises or disregard for the interests of the minority shareholder.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span> provide a useful illustration of how the courts look at the issue of unfairness in the context of an individual case.  In <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span>, the petitioner and his older brother Mike were the only shareholders and directors of Evenstar, with the plaintiff holding 13.5 % of the shares and Mike holding 86.5%.  The petitioner had agreed to Mike’s suggestion that Evenstar be used as the corporate vehicle for them to pool their shares in another company (“Sinwa”) which was subsequently listed.  In the court’s view, the brothers had entered into “what was substantially a quasi-partnership using the company [Evenstar] merely as a vehicle for an agreed object”: the brothers’ partnership in Evenstar was “premised throughout on the fundamental understanding that their association would only continue as long as the petitioner was a willing party” (at [43]).  The evidence showed that Mike had assured the petitioner he could exit from Evenstar by pulling out his Sinwa shares whenever he wanted, provided Mike was given the right of first refusal on these shares; further, that Mike had breached this assurance to the petitioner by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, refusing the petitioner’s request to pull out his Sinwa shares and offering an unfair and unreasonable price for the latter’s Evenstar shares.  In granting the petitioner’s application for the winding-up of Evenstar, the court made it clear that the mutual trust and confidence between the brothers that was necessary to run the business of Evenstar had not broken down: any distrust or loss of confidence by the petitioner in Mike did not stem from the way Mike was managing the affairs of Evenstar.  Instead, the unfairness in this case flowed from Mike’s breach of his promise to let the petitioner pull out from Evenstar: it had “left the petitioner trapped in Evenstar and placed him at the mercy of Mike” (at [42]).  While Mike’s promise was not enforceable as a contract for lack of essential terms, that did not mean that as a matter of justice and equity, the court could not give effect to it on terms that were just and equitable to the petitioner, or for that matter to both brothers, if this was called for.  In the event, the court made a winding-up order as sought by the petitioner, but subject to a number of conditions aimed at allowing the parties time to try to settle their dispute before the winding-up order took effect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a family company may be akin to a quasi-partnership and attract the superimposition of equitable considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Some two years after its decision in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span>, the CoA provided further guidance in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 (“<span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>”) on the exercise of the “just and equitable” jurisdiction under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CA.  In that case, the appellant (“Chi”) had brought applications to wind up the companies set up by his late father, in which he and his two brothers “Chuen” and “Ching” were the shareholders and directors.  The High Court granted the winding-up applications, and the CoA upheld the High Court’s decision, citing in its judgement the following reasons.  Firstly, the CA found that this was “a case of real deadlock amongst the three brother-directors”.  Whereas previously at least Chi and Chuen had been able to agree on most key decisions in the running of the companies (even if it meant Ching was often left out in the cold), by the time of the winding-up proceedings, it was clear that even the relationship between Chi and Chuen had deteriorated badly into “total mistrust”.  As the CoA put it (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[N]o decision could be made because any proposal by one brother would be shot down by the other two.  This is a case of a three-way impasse.  The Companies are just limping along with the three employees managing the daily affairs with no leadership provided from the board of directors.  Accordingly … there is a case of real deadlock amongst the three brother-directors.  The management of the Companies is at a stalemate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Having found deadlock amongst the three brothers, the CoA noted that existing case law appeared to suggest that where a company is not in substance an incorporated partnership, such matters as a deadlock – or more generally, members’ inability to work in association with one another – “may not be relied upon as a ground for winding up, as the rationale for allowing a winding up on such grounds would be absent” (at [24]).  The CoA also noted, however, that Lord Wilberforce in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span> did not rule that the “just and equitable” analysis was only to be applied in situations of quasi-partnership.  On a review of other case law, the CoA concluded that in certain circumstances, family companies could be considered akin to quasi-partnerships (at [31]), stating as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have at [19] above pointed out that a person who joins a company should accept and work within the framework set out in its memorandum and articles of association.  The reason an incorporated partnership is treated somewhat differently is because of the express or implicit understanding among the partners before incorporation as to how the new company is to be run or managed and equity will not allow a person who is a party to that understanding to renege on that understanding.  Compare that situation with that of a company formed by a patriarch for his family: it would be clearly the expectation of the patriarch that the children would co-operate, work the company and make it grow for the common good of themselves and their descendants.  When a child receives shares in such a company from the patriarch, either during the latter’s lifetime or under his will, the child is not really entering into the company of his or her own free will.  So the rationale alluded to at [19] above does not apply to such a scenario.  Quite naturally he or she should aim to work harmoniously with his or her siblings in managing the company and in fulfilling the hopes of the patriarch, and in turn to prosper the company.  Co-operation and mutual trust among sibling shareholder or directors are central to such a family company and their absence is as critical as in a quasi-partnership, and would accordingly warrant its winding up.  Where such a company is in a deadlock because the siblings cannot see eye to eye, it is difficult to perceive why it is necessary to insist that unless a company is set up in the way which was done in <span class="font-italic">Yenidje</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… and <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span>, resort to the just and equitable jurisdiction of the court to order a winding up should not be available.  Ultimately, whether equity should intervene in such situation must necessarily depend on the justice of the case.  In a situation like the present, the unfairness comes in the sense that it would be unfair to insist that the siblings remain together in the company instead of allowing them to go their separate ways …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>, the court found that there was ample evidence that the patriarch Mr Chow had intended the companies he set up to be family companies.  In particular, he had made special provision in the articles of association of each company to ensure that his wishes of wealth distribution and management involvement for male descendants were achieved.  For example, the articles of association of two of the companies expressly provided that all adult male descendants of Mr Chow were entitled to be appointed as directors of the companies.  The three sons had direct shareholdings in the companies and also inherited substantial shares from Mr Chow.  Their sister was not a director and had no direct shareholding in the companies, only holding an indirect interest <span class="font-italic">qua</span> beneficiary of part of their late mother’s estate.  The CA held (at [33]–[34]) that in the circumstances –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… the Companies may be considered akin to quasi-partnerships because of their private, domestic nature and the inherent assumption in the setting up of the Companies, that the shareholders and directors as descendants of the patriarch, would work in concert to grow the Companies, enhance the family fortune and perpetuate the legacy.  Admittedly, not all family companies in the broader sense of the term would automatically be analogous to quasi-partnerships.  Only where the family interest is closely related to the raison-d’etre of the company, will mutual trust and confidence be as important as in a quasi-partnership. </span> For example, if three siblings decided to incorporate a company to start manufacturing toys, their family relationship would be incidental to the business of the company, and the court would have to consider how the business was being run to see if there existed partnership-type obligations of mutual trust and confidence, in order to begin the inquiry of whether there were just and equitable grounds to wind it up.  But where, as in the present case, the family interest is fundamental to the purpose of the company, then the inextricability of the family relations from the business relations amongst the directors may provide justification for equitable winding up of the company because in such a set-up mutual trust and confidence are paramount.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the Companies were not quasi-partnerships, it was clear that mutual trust and confidence among the brothers was the cornerstone of the entire set-up… <span class="font-italic">[T]</span><span class="font-italic">he Companies and their directors’ relationships shared certain characteristics with quasi-partnerships: not only were the shares of the Companies closely held and not easily transferable to outside parties, and not only did the directors hold their positions due to ties of blood rather than to business acumen or commercial considerations, but the parties really had not on their own accord voluntarily on their own accord entered into legal relations with one another to promote some common business interest.  Instead, they inherited or were endowed their shares and directorships by their parents, based on the latter’s understanding or aspiration of furthering the family’s interests cohesively</span>… [T]here is no dispute that the Companies were vehicles to accumulate wealth rather than profit-driven business ventures.  All the directors and shareholders are members of the same family whom the late patriarch expected to get along and uphold the family name and legacy.  Thus mutual trust and confidence were inherently essential to Mr Chow’s objective in incorporating the Companies.  Upon the breakdown of such mutual trust and confidence, the entire purpose of the Companies was destroyed, notwithstanding that the Companies’ properties continued to yield rental income.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah and others v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Yong</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2015] 5 SLR 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>”), the plaintiffs and the 1st and 2nd defendants were all brothers who held shares in two companies (“SSH” and “Kenson”).  The remaining shares were held by other family members.  All but one of the parties were directors of the two companies.  From 2010 onwards, the relationship between the plaintiffs on the one hand and the 1st and 2nd defendants on the other hand began to deteriorate: for example, there were steps taken by both sets of brothers to remove each other from the board of SSH.  The proceedings involved <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> a minority oppression action by the plaintiffs against the 1st and 2nd defendants seeking relief under s 216 of the CA from what they alleged was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct of the defendants in SSH and Kenson.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In this connection, the CoA in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span> noted that the conduct falling within the courts’ purview under s 216 CA was limited to specified categories whereas s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) was phrased more generally as requiring the existence of “just and equitable” grounds and not limited to any particular category of conduct; further, that the “just and equitable” and “oppressive” regimes under our CA each had their respective spheres of application.  However, the CoA also took pains at the same time to highlight (at [37]) that it also recognised that “these two jurisdictions, though distinct, do in fact overlap in many situations since they are both predicated on the court’s jurisdiction to remedy any form of unfair conduct against a minority shareholder.  In this regard, although s 216 CA does not expressly adopt the “just and equitable” principle, the concept of unfairness is common to both sections”.   Although the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> were pursuing a minority oppression action under s 216, I found the High Court’s reasoning pertinent and helpful in relation to the issue of when a company may be subject to equitable considerations.  Referencing <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span> (see the passages cited above at [120]), the court stated at [106]–[107]:

The archetype of this, of course, is the quasi-partnership, i.e. a company within Lord Wilberforce’s first category … In this special class of companies, an extended measure of unfairness will take into account otherwise unenforceable expectations which arise from the members’ personal relationship of mutual confidence rather than from the company’s constitution, and which expectations are not necessarily submerged in the company’s structure…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[G]reater scrutiny is needed in the case of quasi-partnerships because the members of closely held company based on a personal relationship of mutual trust and confidence are inevitably prepared to accept a great degree of informality in spelling out the fundamental understandings and expectations underlying their investment and are more vulnerable to being locked into that investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The High Court also noted (at [109]) that in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>, the CoA had made it clear that family companies could share the characteristics of a quasi-partnership.  In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>, the plaintiffs argued that both the companies (SSH and Kenson) were quasi-partnerships or akin to quasi-partnerships; and that accordingly the court should look beyond the confines of the parties’ strict legal rights and obligations and instead look for informal or implied understandings between the parties which give rise to legitimate expectations between them.  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, the plaintiffs argued that they each had a legitimate expectation of participation in the management of each company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The High Court found that while SSH and Kenson were no doubt “family companies” in the broad sense that all its members who were natural persons were members of a family, neither company was a quasi-partnership or a company akin to a quasi-partnership.  There was thus no scope for the superimposition of equitable consideration.  Instead, the measure of commercial unfairness would be defined by the parties’ legal rights and their legitimate expectations derived from and enshrined in the companies’ constitutions; and against these measures, the court held that the plaintiffs had not been treated unfairly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In coming to these conclusions, the court found the following facts relevant.  Firstly, it was clear that “LKH” – who was the father of both plaintiffs and defendants and the founder of both companies - had run the companies as an autocratic patriarch.  He decided whom to appoint as a director and decided when they should cease to be a director.  Importantly, even though the parties were family members, their relationship in the two companies was not based on mutual trust and confidence between the members.  Unlike the companies in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>, LKH did not set up and run SSH and Kenson “with the inherent assumption … that the shareholders and directors, as descendants of the patriarch, would work in concert to grow the [companies], enhance the family fortune and perpetuate the legacy”.  On the contrary, LKH had an overriding say in both companies up till his death.  All the parties accepted LKH’s authority and his decisions unquestioningly.  So while it was true that there existed in each company a bilateral relationship of mutual trust and confidence between LKH and each son, it was clear that there was no such relationship between each son and all the other sons.  In particular, even as between each son and LKH during his lifetime, there was never any expectation or any basis for any expectation that each son would be involved in managing SSH or Kenson so long as he wished.  In SSH, for example, only the 1st plaintiff (“LKW”) and the 1st defendant (“LBY”) had assisted LKH in managing the company during LKH’s lifetime.  After LKH’s death, these two took over the management of SSH without objection; whereas the other parties were non-executive directors who did not participate, who did not expect to participate, and who did not ask to participate in the management of SSH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 It should be added that in an abundance of caution, the court went on to consider what the position would be if it were assumed that the parties’ relationship as members of SSH and Kenson were personal relationships based on mutual trust and confidence, as a result of which they did not document the fundamental understandings and expectations underlying their investment in the companies.  On the evidence before it, the court found that there was no implied or informal understanding between LKH’s sons that they would each be entitled to participate in the management of the business of SSH or Kenson.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“Unfairness” in the context of a deadlock situation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 1 SLR 763 (“<span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> <span class="font-italic">(Capitol)</span>”), the CoA also provided further guidance as to how the notion of unfairness would operate in a deadlock situation.  In <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> <span class="font-italic">(Capitol)</span>, the respondent companies were holding companies in which the appellants held 50% of the shares, with the other 50% being held by another company (“Chesham”).

The respondent companies’ articles of association contained a clause (clause 22) which stipulated that if any member wished to transfer his shares, the remaining members had a right of pre-emption, and the price of the shares was either to be agreed or (if disputed) to be the fair value as determined by the company auditor.

</div>  Since “at least 17 June 2003” (the date on which the Sisters were appointed as directors in the Companies) “[u]ntil recent years”, the Sisters had, “as directors and shareholders of the Companies, associated with each other (and their Mother) in the conduct of the Family Business on the basis of the personal relationship that they had with each other”.  The Family Basis was thus run on the basis of a relationship of mutual trust and confidence between the Sisters.  In particular, it was a common understanding between them that they would each be entitled to participate in management of the Companies.  In the premises, the Companies were said to be “in effect a quasi-partnership between the Sisters”, or “in any case managed as such by the Sisters since 17 June 2003 together with the Mother until recent events”.

My reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 To begin with, I should point out that it was never adequately explained by Blossom and Ivy exactly what they meant in describing the Companies as a “Family Business”.  From the manner in which they presented their case, it would seem they wanted to persuade me that in the first place, Father had incorporated and run the Companies as “family companies” and with the intention of using them to hold the Properties “for the family’s benefit” – just like the patriarch in <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Assuming this was their intention in describing the Companies as a “Family Business”, I did not find that the evidence supported such a description of the manner in which Father had set up and run the Companies.  In fact, it was clear to me that Father had run the Companies rather like LKH in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> ran his companies: as an authoritarian – even autocratic – figure, who made all major decisions in the management of the Companies’ business, and who had an overriding say in the Companies up till his death in 2003.  Ivy, for example, admitted in cross-examination that the Companies were really set up by Father as the vehicles for holding his investment properties; and he could do whatever he wanted with the Companies.

Although he had seven children (including two sons), Father bequeathed the shares in the Companies only to the four Sisters.  This would appear contrary to any purported intention to have the Companies run as a “<span class="font-italic">Family Business</span>” [emphasis added] that would benefit successive generations.  Father also did not see fit to specify in his will that the Sisters were to refrain from disposing of their shares to non-family members.  Indeed, Father said nothing at all in his will about how the Companies were to be preserved – or for that matter, whether they were to be preserved at all.  There were no provisions in his will for the Companies to be continued as a source of wealth accumulation and wealth distribution for successive generations.  Nor did Father see fit to specify in his will that each of the four Sisters should have an equal say in the Companies and/or each of them should participate equally in managing the Companies.  In fact, contrary to Blossom’s and Ivy’s assertion that the Sisters were “expected” after inheriting their shares to” manage the Companies together”,

</div>  As I explained earlier, I found the evidence showed that Father ran the Companies and made the decisions as to the Companies’ affairs: neither Mother nor any of the Sisters participated in the management of the Companies during his lifetime; and there was no evidence to show that after his death, Mother suddenly took on an active management role in the Companies.  Perhaps most revealing was the fact that after Father’s death, Mother had brought proceedings to seek maintenance from the four Sisters in their capacities as executrices and trustees of Father’s estates – and in the affidavit filed in support of those proceedings, Mother had stated clearly that she was a homemaker who had not been involved in the administration or management of the Companies’ affairs.

Neither Blossom nor Ivy produced any evidence to show that they had at any point challenged the veracity of those statements.

</div> in attempting to bring about harmony between the Sisters, this fact – even if true – did not demonstrate that Mother had played an active part in running the Companies.  It was clear from the evidence of all four Sisters that Mother was aware of the tensions between the Sisters and had tried to help smooth over their differences: Julie, for example, gave evidence of Mother’s attempts to persuade her to reach some compromise with Blossom and Ivy over the sale of the JB Properties.

</div> The deep-seated antagonism between Blossom and Julie was relevant: <span class="font-italic">inter alia,</span> it provided good reason to doubt the narrative of the Sisters coming together to run the Companies in “mutual trust and confidence”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Next, while it is true that the Sisters appointed themselves directors of the Companies on 17 June 2003 (insofar as they were not already directors), I did not find that this fact in itself demonstrated some shared intention to work in concert to preserve the Companies as a continuing source of wealth for the family and its future generations.  Instead, it appeared to me that the decision to appoint themselves as directors was really one of convenience and self-interest.  By 2003, after Father’s death, the only two directors who remained were Mother and Chua.  Both were in their 70s by then: Mother was, in her own words, a “homemaker”; and as for Chua, it was not disputed that he had served as Father’s employee for many years without actually exercising any directorial functions.  These two remaining directors were in no position to run the Companies.  At the same time, there was self-interest on the Sisters’ part in ensuring that they got themselves appointed as directors of the Companies.  Blossom conceded that as executrices and administrators of Father’s estate, they needed to sort out the estate, which was sizeable;

</div>  From what I could see of the evidence, therefore, the Sisters’ decision to appoint themselves as directors was one of expediency, made as part of the Sisters’ efforts to try to sort out Father’s estate.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Sisters’ discussions about cashing in on their inheritance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 On the evidence available, I agreed with defence counsel that the Sisters were trying to find some agreed means of monetising their inheritance – and that this explained at least in part why they kept the Companies going in the meantime.  The bulk of the value of their inheritance lay in their shareholdings in the Companies – and through these shareholdings, in the properties owned by the Companies.  As seen earlier, in May 2009 when the Sisters were discussing what to do about the Companies if Julie resigned as working director, Ivy had proposed as an option the sale of all the properties and the voluntary winding up of the Companies.

Those who still have [Father] in their hearts can either pool their funds together to do something in [Father’s] name or remember [Father] in their own way.  Wrapping up CCH and TBL will be a long process but at least this is one direction I can focus on…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In cross-examination, Ivy admitted that her “key thought process” in writing this email was focused on how the Sisters could cash in on their inheritance.

Tellingly, again, despite prefacing the substantive contents of her email with the remark that the information was for the objective of easing “[business] management”, the various options set out by Blossom in the email actually went beyond “easing business management”.  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, she referred to the option of an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span> sale of most of the Companies’ properties; and in relation to YP, in particular, she noted that if the RV Building were to be sold <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc</span>, YP would be </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… left with one TBL unit which can be sold.

</div>  Essentially, therefore, Blossom and Ivy were saying that since the Sisters were the only siblings to be bequeathed shares in the Companies by Father, the “family interest” must be understood to refer only to the interests of the four of them (and possibly Mother).  This appeared to me to be a self-serving and ultimately circular argument.  It was also not supported by the objective evidence.  Whether one defined the “family interest” as the interests of the entire Tan family (Mother and all seven siblings) and their descendants, or as the interests of the four Sisters and the Sisters’ descendants, there was no evidence that Father had intended the Companies to be the means by which such “family interest” was preserved and advanced.  Neither the Companies’ articles of association nor Father’s will alluded to a “family interest” which the Companies were to be used to look after.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Doreen and Julie acknowledged the existence of a relationship of mutual trust and confidence in their email communications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In closing submissions, it was argued on behalf of Blossom and Ivy that Doreen and Julie had in the course of their email communications acknowledged the existence of a relationship of mutual trust and confidence between the Sisters.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Reading the email as a whole, however, it was impossible to come to any such conclusion.  If anything, read in context, the above sentence which Blossom and Ivy relied on was actually an acerbic reference by Julie to the seven years of relative peace which she and Doreen had enjoyed prior to Blossom joining CCM as a fulltime director in late 2009.  This was obvious from the sentence which followed immediately after, in which Julie – in an obvious reference to Blossom – commented that “the new ‘boss’ is trying to stir matters up again”.  The other comments in the email left no doubt that far from admitting there had previously been cooperation and mutual trust between the Sisters, Julie was of the view that Blossom’s “stirring” or trouble-making was not new.  Hence, for example, her comment to Blossom that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the recent commotion in the office between Dor[een] and I over the “banking” issue is <span class="font-italic">a classic example of yet another of your political play</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Indeed, as defence counsel pointed out, Blossom’s and Ivy’s case – as put to Julie in cross-examination – charged that Julie had (upon Father’s death) been “the only one running the show” until Doreen joined her in CCM; that Doreen and Julie had thereafter been “running [their] fiefdom in the CCM office”; and that “basically, the two of [then] could do what [they] liked in the office”.  Such a contention essentially ran contrary to a narrative in which <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Sisters had come together (with Mother) in June 2003 to run the Companies on the basis of their “mutual trust and confidence”</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In the circumstances, even though the Sisters were family members, their relationship in the Companies was not based on mutual trust and confidence.  This was not a case where the Sisters came together to “co-operate, work the company and make it grow for the common good of themselves and their descendants” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Chao Hick Tin JA at [31] of <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen</span>).  Instead, they were in my view very much in the same position as the warring siblings in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>; and the observations of the High Court in that case<span class="font-italic"> </span>resonated in the present case.  In the present case, as in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>, whilst the Sisters had accepted Father’s authority unquestioningly and whilst there might have existed a bilateral relationship of mutual trust and confidence between Father and each of the Sisters, I found that there was no such relationship as between the Sisters themselves. On the evidence adduced, even as between each sister and Father during his lifetime, there was clearly never any expectation (nor any basis for an expectation) that each sister would participate in managing the Companies.  After Father’s death, the Sisters’ conduct also did not conform to a shared understanding of an equal right to participate in management.  I found that the Companies were not a quasi-partnership, nor could they be said to be a “Family Business” akin to a quasi-partnership.  There was no scope for the superimposition of equitable considerations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a legitimate expectation on the Sisters’ part that each would be entitled to participate equally in managing the Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In the event that I was wrong in making the above findings, I also considered Blossom’s and Ivy’s case on the assumption that the Sisters’ relationships as members of the Companies were based on mutual trust and confidence, as a result of which they did not document certain fundamental expectations underlying their association with each other in the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In this connection, Blossom’s and Ivy’s case (in a nutshell) was that there existed an unwritten, common understanding between the Sisters that each of them was entitled to participate equally in the management of the Companies.    They contended that Doreen and Julie were in breach of this legitimate expectation.  I should add that in their Statement of Claim, it was also stated that there was a “common understanding … that the Sisters would each … treat each other fairly and/or be transparent in their dealings with each other in the management of the Family Business / Companies”.

</div>  However, the exact nature and scope of this other alleged “common understanding” was never explained; and it appeared to be no more than an attempt at including in the pleadings some vague reference to notions of “fairness” and “transparency”.  The focus of Blossom’s and Ivy’s evidence throughout the trial was on their right to an “equal say and stake” in the running of the Companies, and on the manner in which Doreen and Julie had allegedly deprived them of such right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 On the basis of the evidence before me, I did not find Blossom’s and Ivy’s contentions to be made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 In the first place, even after the Sisters appointed themselves as directors of the Companies, only Julie joined CCM as a working director.  In this connection, as mentioned earlier, whilst Blossom and Ivy voiced reservations about the use of the term “working director”, I did not see anything controversial about using the term as convenient shorthand for referring to those directors who worked fulltime in CCM.  Blossom herself admitted upon cross-examination that she too had “in certain communications” referred to Doreen and Julie as the “working directors of CCM” (though she claimed she had “followed” their use of the term).

</div>  I did not believe this allegation because none of the Sisters – including Blossom herself – had averted to any such “request” in their AEICs.  In any event, despite the many caveats and qualifications she sought to raise, even Blossom could not deny that after 17 June 2003, Julie was the only one of the four Sisters who worked fulltime in CCM.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I also noted that when Doreen resigned her position at NUS in 2004 to join Julie in working fulltime in CCM, this was because Julie was expecting another child in 2004, and Doreen knew it “would be difficult for her to handle the workload in CCM by herself”.

</div>  In other words, Doreen’s decision to join CCM as a working director in 2004 was made out of sisterly concern – and not due to any “common understanding” that each Sister had the right to participate equally in managing the Companies.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 As for Blossom and Ivy, following the Sisters’ appointment as directors in June 2003, there was no evidence at all of either of them requesting to be involved in the management of the Companies.  For that matter, there was also no evidence of either of them expressing any expectation that they should be involved in the management of the Companies.  In cross-examination, Blossom alleged that before joining CCM fulltime in 2009, she had already been involved in managing the Companies because she would go in to work in the CCM office “every Saturday”.

</div>  Again, I did not believe this allegation.  If Blossom had indeed been actively involved in managing the Companies since mid-2003, and if she had indeed spent her lunchtimes and Saturdays working in the CCM office, it was simply not believable that she should have failed to mention such a significant fact in her AEIC.  Moreover, Blossom’s story was proven false by the evidence of the Sisters’ email communications.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Thus, for example, the Sisters’ email communications in May 2009 were instructive.  Around this time, Doreen had informed the other Sisters that Julie was thinking of resigning from her CCM position.  In her response,

</div> Ivy alluded to Father having built the Companies “to feed generation after generation”.  In the first place, this description of Father’s plans was highly romanticized and inaccurate, given the manner in which Father had dealt with the Companies, both during his lifetime and in his will (see [142]–[145] above).  Further, and more pertinently, Ivy herself made the following observations about how the Companies should be managed – and by whom – if Julie were to resign:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nan [Julie]’s done a good job for the last 5-6 years … I couldn’t have done better.  Who amongst us 3 can take over … Pi [Blossom] does not want to get involved (only standby if none of us are around). (dorrect [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>me if I’m wrong)  You [Doreen] have [MCST] 641 and TBL … don’t think you should take any more in your current state of health.

TBL, the 2 management companies and YP.

This may take 2-3 years.  Meanwhile Nan is [resigning] in June.  I am sure there is nothing any of us can say to stop her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Considering that Ivy was one of the Plaintiffs, her comments in this email chain were revealing of the Sisters’ attitude towards the Companies and their role in managing these entities.  In her email, Ivy herself showed little inclination to be involved beyond her existing role in looking after the properties in Malaysia where she lived.  In addition, Ivy’s observation that Blossom “does not want to get involved” – and would only “standby” if none of the other Sisters were around – flew in the face of Blossom’s claims at trial about having worked every Saturday in CCM and having been involved in managing the Companies even before 2009.  There was certainly no evidence of Blossom responding to refute Ivy’s observations.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Critically, too, Ivy’s alternative proposal that all the properties be sold – and the Companies voluntarily wound up – showed that there was no common understanding among the Sisters that the Companies should be preserved as a “Family Business” which each of them would participate equally in managing.  It should be noted that none of the other Sisters responded to voice any consternation about the notion that selling the Properties and winding up the Companies might be an option.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Ivy followed up the above email with a further email to Julie on 2 June 2009,

</div> in which she alluded to Julie’s intention to get Blossom “to open her mouth” – apparently a reference to the Sisters’ discussions at that time about what to do with the Companies if Julie resigned as working director.  In that email, Ivy implored Julie to think of how she wanted to “handle” CCH and added:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Looks like you want to <span class="font-italic">be like her [Blossom]</span><span class="font-italic"> … sit back and take the dividends and not query?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Again, these observations as to Blossom’s attitude towards the running of the Companies were revealing, especially since these were observations made before the present proceedings were ever contemplated.  In cross-examination, Ivy attempted to disavow these observations, claiming that she had not previously known about Blossom going to work at CCM “on Saturdays and even at her lunchtime”.

</div> for instance, Ivy had suggested the possibility of “employ[ing] someone” whom they all knew to “entrust the business to”.

</div>, none of them alluded to a shared understanding that each should participate equally in managing the Companies.  Instead, while Ivy carped at the amount she was to receive, Doreen grumbled at the relatively lighter load Ivy had in overseeing CCH Malaysia, Julie adopted a “can’t care less and hands-off attitude”, and Blossom made cryptic references to the need to “[avoid] the possible situation where the one who’s been ‘running’ the company uses the reflection of DF [directors’ fees] for purposes other than that for the good of all”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I noted that subsequently, towards the end of her testimony, Blossom tried to retract this admission, claiming instead that there had been a “discussion” and an “agreement” among the Sisters about each purchasing an equal number of Mother’s shares.  According to Blossom, she had erroneously admitted in cross-examination that there was no such agreement only because she had thought that defence counsel was referring to “a written, formal agreement … signed” by the Sisters.  I found Blossom’s testimony in this respect quite unbelievable.  Defence counsel had never said anything about a “written, formal agreement” when cross-examining her, so there was no basis for her to think he was confining his questions to “written, formal” agreements.  Indeed, when it was first put to her that there was no agreement among the Sisters to purchase Mother’s shares in equal proportions, she had not only admitted there was none, but had added that nevertheless, “the mere fact” that they had taken up equal amounts” of Mother’s shares indicated an intention to maintain the “equality” of their respective stake in the Companies.  The belated – and novel – allegation about a “discussion” and an “agreement” among the Sisters to each purchase an equal number of Mother’s share thus appeared to be a disingenuous attempt by Blossom to “rewrite” an unfavourable portion of her testimony.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I also noted that in her own email to Mother’s then lawyer (one Samuel Yuen) on 12 March 2014,

The Sisters did not come together (whether with or without Mother) to run the Companies as a “Family Business” on the basis of personal relationships of mutual trust and confidence.  There was no common understanding between all four Sisters that they would each be entitled to an “equal say and stake” in the running of the Companies.

This was because even if the Companies were not a quasi-partnership and not subject to equitable considerations, a shareholder might still have legitimate expectations derived for the company’s articles of association (or for that matter, the CA), and the conduct he complains of might have departed from these expectations to the extent that it had become unfair (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> at [103]).

No materials were produced by Blossom and Ivy to persuade me that this was the case.  CCM’s articles of association also clearly did <span class="font-italic">not</span> mandate that the unanimous approval of all four Sisters – or for that matter, of all directors (including Mother) – had to be obtained for any increase in these monthly salaries.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Thirdly, Blossom was in fact presented with the opportunity to put a stop to the allegedly unauthorised and unfair payment of Julie’s increased salary.  In August and September 2017, through emails copied to the other Sisters, Doreen invited Blossom to return to work in CCM.  Doreen informed her that once she returned to CCM, Julie’s salary would be readjusted.

In addition, although Blossom sought to argue that Doreen and Julie would have “hindered” her efforts at management if she had returned to CCM as working director, she had to concede that this was pure speculation on her part, because the bottomline was that she never tried to take up Doreen’s offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 If the payment of Julie’s increased salary had truly been a “visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder [was] entitled to expect” , one would have expected Blossom to accept with alacrity the offer for her to return to helm CCM – and for Doreen and Julie to leave their positions as working directors.  Had she done so, she would have been able to put an end to the payment of the allegedly unauthorised and unfair salary increment.

Doreen represented to Blossom and Ivy that ownership in a Share of TBL could not be divided between shareholders and that she could hold the Extra TBL Share.  On the basis that each Sister would have an equal one fourth share in the Extra TBL Share, Blossom and Ivy had acceded to Doreen’s request to allow Doreen to hold the Extra TBL Share.  Blossom and Ivy did not at that time appreciate or direct their minds to the possibility that shares could be held in joint names.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 According to Blossom and Ivy, it was Doreen who had represented to them that “ownership in a Share of TBL was indivisible”; and that “[i]f they trusted her, she would hold [their] respective one quarter interest in the Extra TBL Share for [them], in her name”.

According to Blossom and Ivy, they had written to Doreen in May 2016 to ask for the return of their respective one-quarter shares, but Doreen had unfairly and wrongfully refused to return them what was rightfully theirs.

If indeed Doreen was holding three-quarters of the extra share in equal proportions on behalf of her three Sisters, there was no reason why Julie would want to act against her own interests by abstaining from claiming her one-quarter share in the face of Blossom’s and Ivy’s claims for theirs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Secondly, Ivy actually admitted in cross-examination the veracity of Doreen’s evidence about the meeting with Mr Cheong, his advice to the Sisters and the Sisters’ agreement to let Doreen have sole beneficial ownership of the extra TBL share.

</div>   In other words, Ivy admitted in cross-examination to the key elements of Doreen’s case regarding the extra share.  Ivy then sought to qualify her admission by claiming that despite the Sisters’ agreement to let Doreen have sole beneficial ownership”, Doreen had “on the side” reached an agreement with her (Ivy) to hold a one-quarter share on her behalf.

</div>  I did not find Ivy’s attempted qualification credible because if the Sisters had unanimously agreed to let Doreen have sole beneficial ownership of the extra share, it made no sense at all for Doreen concurrently to agree to hold one-quarter of the share on Ivy’s behalf (or indeed, on any other Sister’s behalf).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Even Blossom admitted to the meeting between the Sisters and Mr Cheong – although oddly, she professed not to recall anything about the advice given by Mr Cheong on the extra TBL share during that meeting.  This alleged memory lapse seemed to me to be rather far-fetched.  Given that Blossom claimed to remember a representation by Doreen about the indivisibility of the extra share and Doreen’s willingness to be “entrusted” with her Sisters’ respective one-quarter shares,

</div> it was unbelievable that she should remember nothing at all about Mr Cheong’s advice on the very same issue.  In my view, far from having a memory lapse regarding Mr Cheong’s advice, Blossom was simply unwilling to admit that he – and not Doreen – was the one who had told the Sisters the ownership of the extra TBL share could not be divided; further, that she was unwilling to admit this fact because it fitted with Doreen’s evidence that the other Sisters had, upon hearing that advice, agreed to let Doreen have the entire extra share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Blossom’s and Ivy’s conduct through the years also corroborated Doreen’s version of events.

</div>  It was less than a week after Doreen’s announcement that Blossom sent her email of 26 May 2015 to all the Sisters.  Even then, it was noteworthy that in broaching the subject of the extra TBL share with Doreen, Blossom never once claimed ownership of her purported one-quarter interest.  Instead, what she said was this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Is Sis [Doreen] planning to relinquish your responsibilities of all companies shares and if not, which ones?

Even then, when Doreen replied emphatically to reject their demands, neither Blossom nor Ivy took any further action.  Indeed, in an email to the other Sisters on 30 September 2016

I did not believe their claims about Doreen holding one-quarter shares on their behalf.  As such, there was nothing “unfair” about Doreen’s rejection of their demands for the “return” of these one-quarter shares.  In my view, these claims were clearly trumped up by Blossom and Ivy as a reaction to their own fears about Julie getting the extra TBL share.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sale of the Malaysian properties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Next, insofar as the sale of the JB Properties and the aborted sale of the Melaka Properties were concerned, I did not see any basis for finding that Doreen and Julie had treated Ivy (or for that matter, Blossom) “unfairly” in the course of these transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 In respect of the sale of the JB Properties, I did not think it could be disputed that the Sisters had initially agreed to sell them to Julie at RM 2.3 million – and that Ivy had subsequently changed her mind about the sale price, with Blossom’s support.

</div>  This equally belated and surprising allegation was refuted by Blossom’s testimony: when cross-examined about the discussion at the Sisters’ meeting, Blossom had asserted that after Julie informed the others of her wish to buy the JB Properties for RM 2.3 million, Ivy had “<span class="font-italic">also informed the board that there was another sincere buyer at 2.7</span>… So at that meeting, [the Sisters] had agreed to let Julie have it even though it [was] a lower price”.

</div>  There was no reason for Blossom to lie in her recollection of the discussion, given that she was Ivy’s co-plaintiff.  Her testimony therefore proved Ivy a liar: Ivy <span class="font-italic">did</span> mention the RM 2.7 million offer at the Sisters’ meeting; and the allegation about having kept quiet because of Doreen’s instructions was clearly a last-minute invention to make Doreen look bad.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 I also did not find Blossom’s stated concerns about the inclusion of Alan as co-purchaser to be at all reasonable.  Whatever Julie’s personal motives for buying the JB Properties, she eventually agreed to the increased price of RM 2.7 million – and did in fact pay it.  CCH had nothing to complain about, therefore – and in my view, neither did the Sisters.  I did not think it logical to say that Julie was preserving Father’s memory any less if she held the properties jointly with her husband.  In any event, as defence counsel pointed out, Blossom and Ivy had been prepared to sell these properties to a third party – which made Blossom’s purported concerns about Julie’s personal motive for the purchase rather hypocritical.  Blossom’s eventual refusal to sign the sale and purchase agreement – which forced Doreen to rush back from Australia to sign in her place – appeared to me to be an act of sheer pettiness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 As for the aborted sale of the Melaka Properties, again I did not find that Doreen and/or Julie acted “unfairly” or even unreasonably in the whole process.  Again, it could not be disputed that Ivy was the one who changed her mind and increased the sale price after initially agreeing to sell to Doreen at the valuation price of RM 750,000.  Even if Ivy’s motive in changing her mind was a laudable one (in that she claimed she was only acting in the company’s interests), Doreen for her part could hardly be faulted for deciding not to proceed, in light of the hefty increase in the sale price (to RM 1.025 million) within just one month.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 As for Doreen’s conduct after she decided not to proceed with the purchase, I did not find that she tried in any way to obstruct the sale to Pastor Francis.  As far as I could see, her email of 19 August 2014 simply reminded Ivy that she needed to get a directors’ resolution signed by all the directors before proceeding with the sale to Pastor Francis.  This could hardly be considered a controversial point since the directors’ resolution of 16 August 2013 had given approval for CCH to dispose of the properties subject to a “separate Directors’ Resolution” being “prepared and approved once the disposal has been agreed”.

There was no evidence of any objections from Blossom and Ivy to his presence in the office.  Blossom and Ivy were also well aware that shortly after Mother’s death, Doreen – who had been in ill health and who wanted to return to Australia – had told CCM staff on 1 July 2016 that she had given Alan her POA and that the staff should report to Alan on “business matters”.

</div>  Although initially Blossom appeared to deny knowing that Alan was assisting Julie in the office after her own resignation from CCM’s employment in July 2016, she qualified this denial by saying that she did not know if he was assisting “<span class="font-italic">in any official capacity</span> because Doreen did not announce until February 2017”.  This appeared to me to be an implicit admission that Alan had indeed been helping out in the office; and under further cross-examination, Blossom conceded that following her own resignation from CCM’s employment and bearing in mind her own evidence about the responsibilities she had shouldered in CCM, it would have been reasonable for Alan to help Julie out in the office.  While she tried to argue that Alan’s input was unnecessary because she had assured the staff that they could call her for help even after her resignation, she also conceded that she had put a stop to any such arrangement.  She blamed the staff for this, claiming that they had sent her “hostile, disrespectful messages” – but admitted that she had omitted to mention such messages anywhere in her AEIC.  In short, therefore, I did not believe Blossom and Ivy were unaware that Alan had already been helping Julie in the office after Blossom’s resignation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 While Blossom grumbled that Doreen “did not announce [Alan’s involvement] until February 2017”, it was not disputed that Alan (and Goodstar) had received no payment between July 2016 and February 2017.

</div> I did not see any basis for this argument.  Blossom and Ivy did not cite any provision of the CA or any clause in CCM’s articles of association which mandated the approval of the Board for the company to contract for professional services such as management consultancy services.  There was no evidence that the entire CCM Board’s approval was required in order for the company to contract for consultancy services (or indeed, any sort of professional services).  I did not think this could have been the only time that CCM had contracted for professional services, bearing in mind its role as a managing agent to the other companies.  If there had been evidence of a practice whereby the Board’s approval was required for the company to engage professional services, no doubt Blossom and Ivy would have produced such evidence – but they did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In relation to the contract between CCM and Goodstar, Blossom and Ivy further argued that Julie had breached her duty of disclosure under s 156 CA by failing to declare her interest in the contract.  With respect, this was again another baseless argument.  Blossom and Ivy were well aware that the “Tang Siew Kwong (Alan)” referred to in Doreen’s email of 15 February 2017 was Julie’s husband.  Indeed, they themselves made a point of stating that fact in their reply to Doreen on 16 February 2017.

Again, I found this suggestion baseless. Whilst it was true that Alan did not produce any written reports, I accepted his evidence that his practice was to convey his views verbally to Julie and Doreen.  Given the nature of their relationship, I did not find it anomalous or unreasonable that his communications with these two sisters should have been of a more informal nature.  Moreover, quite apart from Doreen’s and Julie’s evidence that he had provided assistance to them in running CCM’s operations, it was clear that the staff of CCM too had been accustomed to turning to Alan for advice or input.  Thus, for example, Lee Bee Khim (“Kim”)’s evidence showed that when she discovered the incomplete state of the remedial works done by Suntec Real Estate’s contractors at the RV Building, she had turned to Alan for input, and this had led to his notifying Doreen and their lodging a report with the BCA.

This allegation, if true, would have been a material fact in the context of Blossom’s and Ivy’s case about being unfairly shut out from management decisions and/or being unfairly denied access to information.  Yet, oddly, it was never pleaded and instead only surfaced in Blossom’s AEIC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 Secondly, when Kim was asked about this matter, she testified that prior to the tenant filing suit, the tenant’s lawyers had been writing to CCH – and she (Kim) had kept Blossom and Ivy updated on the matter even at that pre-filing stage.

</div>  It was not disputed that Kim was the point person for CCH in relation to the conduct of DC Suit 3773.  She was unshaken in her testimony, despite cross-examination; and I accepted her version of events.  It must be remembered that at the time DC Suit 3773 of 2013 was commenced, Blossom was still employed fulltime as a working director in CCM; and she was in charge of administrative matters and the staff (including Kim) in the office.

</div>  I did not find it believable that Kim would somehow have been able to keep from Blossom’s knowledge all correspondence of a litigious nature being faxed to the office. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Indeed, Kim’s testimony was proven true by the evidence of Blossom’s own email communications.  In her email to the other three Sisters on 19 September 2016, in response to an email dated 16 September 2016 from Doreen in which the latter had informed the other Sisters that they were “required to exercise due diligence as directors under instructions from the High Court in respect of DC Suit 3773 of 2013”, Blossom stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">I had already authorised Julie way back in 2013 to lodge an affidavit concerning Khim’s AEIC</span>.

To begin with, if there had really only been one particular board meeting at which she and Ivy were “shut out from asking questions” about DC Suit 3773, this incident must have stuck in her memory – and yet she did not see fit to specify when this board meeting took place or to give any details of it.  In cross-examination, defence counsel highlighted to her minutes from a Board meeting in August 2015 which clearly recorded comments she had made about DC Suit 3773 at a board meeting.

In any event, given that the suit was brought against CCH and that all four Sisters were then directors and shareholders of CCH, it did not make sense that Doreen and Julie should have wanted to stop Blossom and Ivy from asking questions or making comments about DC Suit 3773, whether at the start of the suit or later on.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Managing agent for TBL and MCST 325</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Blossom and Ivy also alleged that Doreen and Julie had acted unfairly in “unilaterally causing” CCM to cease to be managing agent for TBL

</div>  Both explained that it was the company secretary who had referenced article 74 (in the minutes of meeting) as the relevant article to be relied on for not re-electing Blossom.  When referred in cross-examination to the TBL articles of association, both Doreen and Julie candidly agreed that the reference to article 74 was mistaken.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 It was not disputed that at the AGM on 27 September 2016, there was no resolution passed to reduce the number of directors on the TBL board. Nor was it disputed that Blossom’s place on the board was never filled up by someone else.  On a plain reading of article 87, therefore, it would appear that Blossom should have been deemed re-elected to the TBL board; and Doreen and Julie were in error in voting against her re-election.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 However, assuming Doreen and Julie had infringed article 87 of the articles of association, this did not automatically lead to a finding of “commercial unfairness”.  As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> noted, conduct that is unlawful may not be unfair.  I still had to consider the relevant circumstances to assess whether there was a “visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect”.  In this connection, having regard to the instances highlighted by Doreen and Julie of Blossom’s disturbing behaviour <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> CCM’s staff and operations and the disruptive manner in which she had resigned from CCM, I found that they did have good reasons for being concerned about her ability to discharge her duties as a director of TBL  I also found it revealing that although Blossom did ask for clarification as to the reasons for her non-re-election, she did not demand to be reinstated – which suggested that she was cognisant of the grounds which Doreen and Julie had for their decision.  She also did not seek to highlight article 87 to Doreen and Julie at any time prior to their cross-examination during the trial in late 2019, even though on her own evidence she had already become aware of the provision in 2018.

</div>  In fact, upon further cross-examination, Blossom switched tack and claimed that what she was concerned about in relation to TBL was the “substantial” amount of cash which had been placed in fixed deposits instead of being placed in other investments.  This appeared to me to be a rather belated – and glib – shift in position.  In any event, saying that TBL’s cash was placed in fixed deposits rather than in potentially higher-yield but also higher-risk investments was a completely different thing from saying that the company’s “operations and growth [were] crippled”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 As for CCH, YP and CCM, it was not disputed that these three companies have generated revenue through the years and continue to do so.  As defence counsel pointed out, Blossom’s and Ivy’s dissatisfaction was really with the RV Building: in the main, the decision by Doreen and Julie to shorten the leases for units in the building so that tenants would have vacated the building by the time major remedial and repair works commenced (which decision Blossom and Ivy claimed was taken without their approval), and the corresponding decline in rental revenue for the period.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 I make the following points.  Firstly, the fact that Blossom and Ivy were not consulted on the decision to shorten the individual leases did not signify that the operations of CCM (or of CCH and YP) were “crippled”.  By 28 July 2016 Blossom had resigned from CCM’s employ.  Ivy too had announced that she was retiring “from involvement in the Singapore operations”

</div>  Having deliberately removed themselves from involvement in the “daily running” of the Companies’ Singapore operations, they had no basis for complaining if - in their capacity as the remaining working directors of CCM - Doreen and Julie made decisions on the duration of the leases to be entered into for individual units in the RV Building. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 Indeed, I would also make it clear that from what I could see, Blossom’s and Ivy’s abrupt departures from CCM in July 2016 were clearly coordinated: they both wrote in on the same day, and their letters contained numerous similarities, right down to the use of the same header (“Without prejudice”) and footer (“This letter is considered received and read upon the opening of the email or hardcopy”).  Even leaving aside the suspicious timing of the company secretary’s resignation, it was plain that Blossom’s and Ivy’s stratagem was to disavow any responsibility for the tedious day-to-day operations of CCM while leaving themselves free – as directors of CCM – to carp and cavil at the decisions made by Doreen and Julie.  This is why I have described their dissociation from the daily operations as a deliberate move on their part.  Moreover, it did not appear to me that they raised criticisms or objections out of a genuine desire to provide constructive input: rather, it appeared that they were deliberately non-constructive in the various criticisms they raised.   This was seen for example in their objections to the decision taken to carry out repairs to individual units in the RV Building and the related decision to shorten leases for these units.  Their suggestion that tenants should have remained in the RV Building even as the mandatory remedial works on the spalling concrete were carried out seemed to me not only spurious but irresponsible.  The further suggestion that “it’s happened before” was admitted by Blossom to be unsupported by any evidence in her own AEIC.

The building was old and clearly not in good condition.  Over the years, Julie had highlighted to MCST 325 that an increasing number of units were becoming “non-tenantable” due to wear and tear.

</div>  That the physical deterioration of the building had reached a critical stage was borne out by the directions issued by the BCA in 2017 for mandatory remedial works.  These remedial works concerned primarily extensive repairs to spalling concrete around the building and waterproofing of the roof to address long-standing water seepage problems.  As for the individual units in the RV Building, even Blossom – who insisted that “<span class="font-italic">some</span>” units were “not so bad” and still “tenantable” – was compelled to concede that the “majority” of units were in a “terrible condition”.

If this were true, however, one would have to question what MCST 325 had been doing over the years in terms of its oversight of the building.  Moreover, if it were true that most units were in poor condition due to the lack of maintenance over the years, then Blossom and Ivy could hardly have any basis for complaining about the decision to carry out repairs to individual units at the same time the BCA remedial works were being done.  Indeed, in cross-examination, Blossom acknowledged that “perhaps” the same decision would have been reached even if all four Sisters had discussed the matter together.

Both Blossom and Ivy also rejected Doreen’s suggestion that they pass the CCM accounts so as not to delay the AGM, and that the issue of Julie’s salary increment be taken up at the next board meeting as an “operational concern”.

As I pointed out earlier, if the payment of the increased salary was really such a critical issue that it transcended operational concerns, I would have expected Blossom to seize the opportunity to return to CCM and to halt these payments.  That she refused the opportunity told me that her real concern was not the salary payments: instead, what she and Ivy clearly wanted was to retain some form of leverage over Doreen and Julie, and to keep the pressure on them.  This, in my view, was also why they rejected Doreen’s suggestion that they pass the CCM accounts first and then discuss the salary issue at the next board meeting.  Other than the issue of Julie’s salary increment, Blossom and Ivy have never suggested any reason why the CCM accounts could not be approved.  As to the salary increment, their complaint was that it had been effected without the prior unanimous approval of the CCM board.  However, if this was the case, it had nothing to do with the accuracy of the CCM accounts, and there was no need to hold up the approval of these accounts.  They could easily have discussed the lack of board approval at a board meeting (as <span class="font-italic">per</span> Doreen’s suggestion): there was no question of Doreen or Julie being able to “sweep” the issue “under the carpet” if this was done.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 In the circumstances, I rejected Blossom’s and Ivy’s argument that the delay in the approval of the CCM accounts represented further evidence of a deadlock.  In my view, the reason given by them for not being able to approve these accounts made no sense and was plainly trumped up so as to provide them with yet another source of leverage over Doreen and Julie.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 As for their complaint that the staff of CCM had “turned against” them,

</div> they failed to explain how this was indicative of a “deadlock” within the Companies.  In the first place, as I noted earlier, even if it were true that the staff resented or feared them, it appeared to me that this was because of the way they had chosen to treat the staff: see for example [10] to [52] of Kim’s AEIC.  More pertinently, Doreen had already made it known that she and Julie were prepared to leave their positions as working directors if Blossom returned to CCM fulltime.  If Blossom had taken up Doreen’s offer to return to CCM, therefore, she would have been the sole working director; and she could then have hired new staff if she truly had concerns about the existing staff’s willingness to work with her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 There were miscellaneous other allegations raised by Blossom and Ivy in relation to their claims of “deadlock”.  For example, they alleged that Julie had refused to sign cheques.  However, apart from their bare assertions, there was no objective evidence of Julie having refused to sign cheques <span class="font-italic">for no good reason</span>.  Julie herself testified that she would seek clarification from the staff when she came across cheques she had queries about; and if the staff were unable to provide clarification, she would not sign the cheque.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 I rejected Blossom’s suggestion as being baseless.  It should be borne in mind that Doreen had drafted the letter without the benefit of legal advice.  Whilst Doreen as a layperson might not have been cognisant of the need for certain caveats or qualifications to be made express, what mattered was how the Sisters themselves understood the letter of undertaking to operate.  In this respect, it should be noted that Ivy – as Blossom’s co-plaintiff – was very clear that she understood the letter of undertaking to permit the sale of their shares to third parties if consent was obtained from the other Sisters.  In her AEIC (at [14]), Ivy’s description of the undertaking which the Sisters had agreed was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [the] Sisters also agreed and undertook amongst themselves that they would not sell their shares to third parties, without consent from the other Sisters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 Even Blossom’s claim about the prohibitive effect of the letter of undertaking was something which was raised belatedly in cross-examination: she admitted that she “might have missed it out” in her AEIC.  Indeed, it appeared to me to be something Blossom had <span class="font-italic">invented</span> in the course of the trial.  This was because she had been at pains in her AEIC to emphasise repeatedly how she and Ivy were trapped in the Companies: I did not find it believable that she would have “missed out” something as pertinent as the purported prohibition which the letter of undertaking imposed on sales to third parties.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 Furthermore, Blossom’s own evidence contradicted her claims that she had genuinely believed the letter of undertaking to prohibit any sale to third parties.  In her AEIC (at [275]), she had stated that she and Ivy could not find any buyer for their shares.  This necessarily implied that the two of them had tried – albeit unsuccessfully – to find third-party buyers for their shares; and in cross-examination, she alleged that they had “checked with [their] auditors, and they have come back and said no, 50 per cent, no one – they couldn’t find anyone interested”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 I must add that although Blossom and Ivy sought to argue that nobody would have been interested in buying 50% of the shareholding in companies where the management was “deadlocked”, I did not find this argument persuasive.  I have already explained why I rejected their argument that there was management deadlock in the Companies.  I also found the argument that nobody would have been interested in a 50% shareholding wholly speculative, since no evidence was provided in Blossom’s and Ivy’s AEICs to show that they had actually approached third parties.  Given that all four Companies were indisputably viable going concerns and that they owned fully paid-up properties in good locations, it did not seem to me at all obvious that “nobody” would have found the prospect of a 50% shareholding in the Companies remotely attractive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 It appeared to me that Blossom and Ivy were conscious of the speculative nature of their argument: in cross-examination, both suddenly purported to give details of efforts they had made to find third-party buyers for their shares.  I did not find these belated claims credible.  No objective evidence was produced by either of them to substantiate these claims.  In particular, no evidence – whether in the form of emails or text messages – was put forward to substantiate their claims as to having checked with the auditors (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Blossom) and with a “real estate agent” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Ivy).  Indeed, given the rather startling claim by Ivy that she had managed through a real estate agent to find a third party “willing to buy 100 per cent” of the shares in the Companies, it was unbelievable that she should apparently have failed to retain any evidence of the offer and/or to communicate it to any of the other Sisters.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 As for Ivy’s assertion that she had asked NLA’s then managing partner Lee Kian Eng Jerry (“Jerry”) to look for a third-party buyer for her shares and Blossom’s, this was emphatically refuted by Jerry, who testified that Blossom and Ivy had never asked him to find third-party buyers for their shares.

</div>  Instead, what he had done was to try to help them find a buyer for “their River Valley properties”.  I believed Jerry’s testimony on this subject.  This portion of his testimony was not seriously challenged.  There was no sensible reason in any event why he should have wanted to lie about what it was he had tried to help Blossom and Ivy find purchasers for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 On the evidence adduced, it was clear to me that Blossom and Ivy had never actually made any efforts to find third-party buyers for their shares.  These were claims they came up with belatedly at trial to try to bolster their story about being “trapped” in the Companies.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Multiple opportunities for Blossom and Ivy to exit from the Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 On the evidence adduced, it was also clear that Blossom and Ivy actually had multiple opportunities to exit from the Companies, albeit in stages rather than all at once - but that they rejected these opportunities unreasonably as part of a deliberate strategy to pressure Doreen and Julie into purchasing all their shares in the Companies in a single transaction.  It was also clear that even when Doreen and Julie had caved in and offered to buy all their shares in the Companies in a single transaction, Blossom and Ivy continued to make arbitrary – and ultimately exorbitant – demands which caused the deal to fall through.  In other words, Blossom and Ivy blocked their own exit from the Companies by their unreasonable conduct.  I explain below my reasons for arriving at this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 At the outset, I should make it clear that I did not accept Blossom’s and Ivy’s argument that the only viable option for their exit from the Companies lay in their being able to exit <span class="font-italic">all four Companies at one go</span>.  There was no sensible reason why this should be so.  Assuming they managed to exit only some of the Companies first, there was nothing to stop them from proceeding to negotiate their exit from the remaining Companies.  In particular, since much of the conflict between the Sisters related to their differing views over what to do about the condition of the RV Building, and since Blossom and Ivy were also disgruntled at the lack of dividends from CCH and YP, it made sense for them to exit these two companies first if they could, before taking stock of what to do next with their shares in TBL and CCM – and negotiating their exit from these companies if necessary.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The board meeting of 10 February 2017 and the correspondence thereafter </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 One of the opportunities for Blossom and Ivy to exit at least two of the four Companies arose at the board meetings of the Companies on 10 February 2017.  It was Blossom’s and Ivy’s case that they had offered to sell Doreen and Julie all their shares in all four Companies at this meeting.  Doreen’s and Julie’s case was that at this meeting, Blossom and Ivy had only offered to sell their shares in CCH and YP – and that was what Doreen and Julie offered to buy in their letter via email of 14 March 2017.

</div>  On balance, having examined the evidence available, I accepted Doreen’s and Julie’s version of events.  In the first place, although Blossom and Ivy claimed that their personalised comments on the minutes of the meetings showed that they had offered to sell all their shares in the four Companies, I found these personalised comments to be self-serving and unreliable, having been penned by none other than Blossom and Ivy themselves <span class="font-italic">after</span> the meetings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 Blossom’s and Ivy’s self-penned comments about having offered to sell <span class="font-italic">all </span>their shares did not appear in any case to jibe with what was recorded by the company secretary in the minutes of meetings.  The company secretary had recorded in the minutes of the CCH and YP board meetings that “Ivy and Blossom will also consider selling out their shares at the valuation done by Jerry”.

</div>  If Blossom and Ivy had indeed expressed their intention to sell their TBL and CCM shares at the Valuation Price stated in the 2016 Valuation Reports, there was no reason why the company secretary should have failed to record such expression of intent in the minutes for these two companies, when they had done so for CCH and YP.  Blossom’s explanation that the omission in the TBL minutes must have been due to her not being a TBL director was both glib and nonsensical.  There was no sensible reason why the company secretary would have deliberately omitted any mention of the intended sale of her TBL shares on the ground that she was no longer a director of TBL.  Moreover, Ivy was certainly still a director of TBL at the time; and no mention was made in the TBL minutes of any offer by Ivy to sell her TBL shares.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 A perusal of the 14 March 2017 letter from Doreen and Julie also showed that at that stage, they were clearly offering to buy Blossom’s and Ivy’s shares in CCH and YP – and not all their shares in all four Companies.  Doreen and Julie addressed the letter to CCH and YP; and in the letter, they berated Blossom and Ivy for having – in their capacity as council members of MCST 325 (the MCST for the RV Building) – made decisions “not in accordance with government guidelines regarding the maintenance of the building and hence risking tenants’ and public safety”.  They also noted that Blossom and Ivy had refused to spend “so much money on repairs as the building is old” and had refused “to make good defects in the building”.  The letter ended with the following paragraph:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Given that you have no interests in the businesses of the companies and have expressed at the last Board of Directors Meetings on 10 February 2017 that you are ready to sell your shares, we have indicated that we can buy your shares</span> in order to continue our Father’s legacy.

</div>  Her insistence that nevertheless Doreen’s and Julie’s offer in the final paragraph to buy her shares and Ivy’s was an offer to buy all their shares in all four Companies appeared to me to fly in the face of the evidence.  In particular, her narrative would make nonsense of the clear statement in the final paragraph that “[g]iven that [Blossom and Ivy had] no interests in the businesses of [CCH and YP] and [had] expressed at the last Board of Directors Meetings on 10 February 2017 that [they were] ready to sell [their] shares”, Doreen and Julie had “indicated that [they] [could] buy [Blossom’s and Ivy’s] shares”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Blossom’s and Ivy’s response to the 14 March 2017 letter was instructive.

There was no way they could have genuinely believed the letter to have come from anyone other than Doreen and Julie.  Indeed, some of the remarks in their reply of 20 March 2017 were clearly directed at Doreen and Julie – for example, the remark about “facts communicated to both of you via emails and physical meetings”.  When cross-examined, Blossom admitted that when she received the 14 March 2017 letter, <span class="font-italic">she knew that it came from Doreen and Julie</span>.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 In short, it was plain that Blossom and Ivy knew the 14 March 2017 letter came from Doreen and Julie.  Having regard to my findings at [283] to [286] above, it was also plain that they knew Doreen and Julie were offering to buy their shares in CCH and YP.  Why then did they pretend not to know whether the letter was “authentic” instead of taking up this offer?  In my view, this was a regrettable example of greed and calculation rearing their ugly heads.      Once they saw that Doreen and Julie were willing to buy their shares (and willing to buy these shares in spite of – or perhaps, <span class="font-italic">because of</span> – their exasperation with Blossom’s and Ivy’s behaviour in these two companies), Blossom and Ivy decided to shift the goal posts so as to try to get Doreen and Julie to buy their shares in all four Companies.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 This was in fact Doreen’s and Julie’s narrative.  I should add that quite apart from the evidence, this narrative made much more sense simply as a matter of logic.  Blossom and Ivy claimed that Doreen and Julie kept “stringing them along” and applying pressure to make them cave in and sell all their shares at the “heavily discounted” Valuation Price.

This was the case whether one accepted Blossom’s and Ivy’s contention that they had wanted to sell their shares in all the Companies in February 21017, or one accepted Doreen’s and Julie’s contention that the offer had only been to sell the CCH and YP shares.  Even as at 30 June 2017, Blossom was still willing to sell at the Valuation Price, although Ivy was not.  In the circumstances, as the prospective sellers, it would have been entirely reasonable for Blossom and Ivy to state the price they were looking for, if indeed both of them were no longer willing to consider the Valuation Price.  In this connection, it should be remembered that while the articles of association of CCH, YP and TBL did not provide for a mechanism for determining the price to be adopted in a share buy-out between members, CCM’s articles specifically provided for the prospective seller to name the price he regarded as the fair value of his shares: see clause 29 of CCM’s articles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 When pressed in cross-examination, Blossom claimed – somewhat confoundingly – that she had not actually changed her mind after the 30 June 2017 meeting about selling at the Valuation Price.

</div> Doreen and Julie wrote to Blossom and Ivy pointing out that they had “kept changing [their] minds” previously, and asking them to clarify how they intended to proceed and at what price they intended to sell their shares.  In my view, Doreen’s and Julie’s request was a reasonable one.  The observation that Blossom and Ivy had kept changing their minds was warranted.  After having declared their willingness to sell their shares on 17 February 2017, they had rebuffed Doreen’s and Julie’s offer on 14 March 2017.  Further, despite having been willing on 17 February 2017 to sell at the Valuation Price, by 30 June 2017 Ivy had changed her tune and was claiming she would “no more” sell at the Valuation Price.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 Notably, Doreen’s and Julie’s letter of 7 August 2017 stated clearly once again that if no agreement could be reached on their purchase of Blossom’s and Ivy’s shares, the latter could “also consider selling to other parties”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 If Blossom and Ivy had genuinely wanted to sell their shares and to exit the Companies, they could – and should – simply have stated their proposed sale price.  In doing so, they would have been able to confirm whether Doreen and Julie were willing to meet the proposed sale price; and if there was no agreement on the price, they could then have reviewed their options – which included the possibility of selling to other parties.  Instead, they chose to respond on 17 August 2017 by accusing Doreen and Julie of having no genuine intention to buy their shares, and even declaring that there was “nothing more” for them to say.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 This accusation was plainly unfounded, because even after this abrupt rebuff, Doreen and Julie continued to engage Blossom and Ivy.  On 25 August 2017, Doreen wrote to them again noting that much of their unhappiness appeared to centre on CCM and the issue of Julie’s salary, and indicating that she and Julie were willing to purchase their shares in CCM.  In their reply on 5 September 2017, Blossom and Ivy dismissed this offer, claiming there was “no point in continuing this correspondence any further”.  In so doing, they claimed that it was because Doreen and Ivy had “refused[d] to confirm” their willingness to “buy out [their] entire shareholding in all the four companies” and “further refused to name [their] price”.  On 7 December 2017, Blossom and Ivy filed the applications to wind up all four Companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 I found Blossom’s and Ivy’s behaviour – as described above – entirely unreasonable.  As I have already noted, since they were the prospective sellers and since earlier discussions about the sale of shares had already focused on the Valuation Price as the purchase price, Blossom and Ivy could and should have made known the price at which they wished to sell, instead of acting coy and then playing the blame game with Doreen and Julie.  Their reaction to Doreen’s email of 25 August 2017 was also very much exaggerated.  Whilst Doreen’s email stated an offer to buy the CCM shares, the rest of her email made it clear that the offer to buy the CCM shares was intended to address directly Blossom’s and Ivy’s complaints about the management of CCM and in particular about the increase in Julie’s salary from CCM.  There was nothing in Doreen’s email which suggested that she and Julie were closing the door on the possibility of buying the shares in the other companies.  It was Blossom and Doreen who closed the door themselves by declaring an end to the correspondence and filing the winding up applications shortly thereafter.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The decision to file for winding up of the Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 Blossom’s and Doreen’s behaviour – in breaking off correspondence and then filing for winding up – must also be seen in the context of their earlier behaviour.  I have earlier explained why I found that their abrupt resignations on 28 July 2016 were really a deliberate ploy to disavow any responsibility for the daily operations of CCM while leaving themselves free (as directors) to attack the decisions made by Doreen and Julie.  Of particular vehemence were their attacks on the decisions regarding repairs at the RV Building and the shortening of leases, and on the decision to increase Julie’s salary from CCM (the latter being a focal point for their refusal to approve CCM’s 2016 accounts).  Seen in context, this course of conduct had an underlying agenda.  The attacks on Doreen’s and Julie’s decisions as working directors of CCM constituted a source of constant pressure and aggravation – which Blossom and Ivy knew would lead to their caving in to demands sooner or later.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 Thus, for example, after Blossom and Ivy had persisted in refusing to pass CCM’s 2016 accounts, Doreen’s and Julie’s increasing desperation to resolve this issue – and to forestall further sanctions from ACRA – could be seen in their offer to buy the other two’s CCM shares on 7 August 2017,

</div>  Both attempts were rebuffed by Blossom and Ivy, who then proceeded to raise the stakes – and correspondingly, the pressure on Doreen and Julie – by applying to wind up all four Companies.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 That these pressure tactics worked could be seen in the fact that even after the filing of the winding up applications and right up to the trial, Doreen and Julie continued to engage Blossom and Ivy (through their respective counsel) in negotiations to purchase their shares.  Indeed, not only did Doreen and Julie continue to engage Blossom and Ivy in negotiations, they made a number of significant concessions in the course of these negotiations.  In my view, the parties’ inability ultimately to close the deal for the share purchase was entirely due to Blossom’s and Ivy’s continued, unreasonable demands. I explain below why I came to this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The negotiations post commencement of winding up proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 It should be noted at the outset that by the time of the trial, parties were agreed on what the purchase price to be paid by Doreen and Julie should be.  Both Blossom and Ivy agreed in cross-examination that the purchase price for all their shares was to be based on the Valuation Price, with the total purchase price agreed at S$63,150,836.39.

</div>
</div>  I should add at this point that the existence of such an agreement made it all the more difficult to appreciate the purpose of their counsel’s unexpected attack in cross-examination on Jerry’s impartiality and his valuation methodology.  I will deal with this point shortly.  For now, it should be noted that with the purchase price being agreed among the parties, Doreen and Julie had given way on a number of issues which had been stumbling blocks during earlier stages of negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 Thus, for example, insofar as the payment of additional conveyance duty (“ACD”) was concerned, Doreen and Julie had earlier requested that Blossom and Ivy pay for this item – which request they had then moderated to a request that the other two pay 50% of the ACD.  Doreen’s and Julie’s rationale for asking that the other two bear part of the ACD was that ACD had been introduced on 11 March 2017 at 18% and had subsequently been raised to 34% on 6 July 2018.  As such, if Blossom and Ivy had accepted their offer to buy at least the CCH and YP on 14 March 2017, they would not have had to pay ACD at the considerably higher rate of 34%.  To my mind, Doreen’s and Julie’s request was not unreasonable.  After all, Blossom and Ivy had declared their willingness to sell their CCH and YP shares on 10 February 2017 (as documented in the CCH and YP minutes of meetings); and Doreen and Julie had responded with an offer to buy these shares on 14 March 2017: as noted earlier, the fact that the sale was not consummated at that stage was entirely due to Blossom’s and Ivy’s delay tactics in pretending to doubt the authenticity of the 14 March 2017 letter.  Be that as it may, when Blossom and Ivy refused to pay any part of the ACD, Doreen and Julie dropped their request and agreed that they would pay the entire ACD amount – which would come to a very large sum at 34%.  Under cross-examination, Blossom and Ivy were obliged to concede that this represented a compromise by Doreen and Julie.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 Blossom sought to qualify this concession by denying that it was a compromise of any significance.  The key point I would highlight, however, is this: Blossom and Ivy have repeatedly accused Doreen and Julie of “putting up a false pretence” and having no real intention to allow them to exit the Companies.  If this were indeed true, then it would make no sense for Doreen and Julie to continue to engage them in negotiations <span class="font-italic">and </span>to make numerous concessions in these negotiations.  If Doreen and Julie had been determined to thwart Blossom’s and Ivy’s efforts to exit the Companies, they had no reason to concede any disputed items or to try to move towards a settlement agreement.  Instead, if they had harboured such a mischievous agenda, it would have been far more consistent with that agenda to dig in their heels and to force the other two to litigate every issue to the bitter end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 As another example, this willingness to compromise and to continue negotiations could be seen in Doreen’s conduct <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the extra TBL share.  It will be recalled that Doreen had been extremely upset at Blossom’s and Ivy’s accusations regarding her retention of the extra TBL share.  Blossom’s and Ivy’s proposal – that a clause be included in any settlement agreement to the effect that they relinquished any right to the extra share – was really adding insult to injury since any such clause would imply that Blossom and Ivy had some sort of right to (or interest in) the extra share in the first place.  Even then, Doreen had continued with the negotiations over this point.  At one stage, having already backed down from her original proposal that Blossom and Ivy expressly acknowledge in the settlement agreement her ownership of the extra share, she suggested that they acknowledge her ownership by way of a side letter – and not in the settlement agreement itself.  When Blossom and Ivy refused to budge on the matter, Doreen went several steps further: she simply agreed not to pursue the allegation regarding the extra TBL share.  This effectively laid to rest an issue which had been a source of persistent contention between the Sisters.  Even Blossom had to admit that this was a significant act of compromise by Doreen which removed one of the obstacles to the finalisation of the settlement agreement.

</div>  The key terms of the offer are summarised at [535] of the Defendants’ closing submissions.  In gist, the total purchase price remained agreed between the parties at S$63,150,836.39, and all other terms were agreed, save for five issues.  Having examined the evidence and considered the parties’ testimony at trial, I concluded that Blossom and Ivy were entirely unreasonable in insisting on having their way on these outstanding five issues.  I explain below my reasons for coming to this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Blossom’s and Ivy’s demand for a 3-month completion period</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">309 Insofar as completion of the sale and purchase of all the shares were concerned, Doreen and Julie had proposed a completion period of 6 months.  This was shorter than the completion periods they had previous proposed (of up to a year, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>).  However, Blossom and Ivy were adamant that the completion period could only be 3 months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 In my view, Blossom’s and Ivy’s insistence on a 3-month completion period was not only unrealistic: it was extremely unreasonable and ultimately spiteful.  It must be remembered that the total purchase price for the shares came to more than S$63 million.  This was a substantial sum by any objective standards.  It was hardly surprising that Doreen and Julie would require some time to arrange for the necessary funds from the banks.  Blossom’s claim that financing could be “done for less than three months” was one which she was unable to substantiate with any evidence; and she conceded that she had “limited knowledge” in this area.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 When asked why the completion period had to be 3 months and no longer, neither Blossom nor Ivy was able to give a coherent explanation: they simply ended up insisting that they wanted Doreen and Julie to produce “compelling reasons” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Blossom) and “concrete evidence” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Ivy) that a period of more than 3 months was necessary.  This was baffling, since it had already been explained to them by defence counsel that 6 months was the period that Doreen and Julie estimated to be required safely to complete all necessary procedures for obtaining financing.  It was also explained (and not disputed) that Doreen and Julie already had letters of offer that they had worked on with the banks;

</div>
</div> in other words, this was not a case where Doreen and Julie had sat back, done nothing, and then pulled the 6-month timeline out of thin air.  Moreover, at the trial, Doreen and Julie had offered a further compromise by proposing that while the completion period be set at 6 months, they would endeavour to complete earlier.

</div>  This was clear proof of their sincerity in trying to reach a settlement for the sale and purchase of the shares.  I found it most regrettable that Blossom and Ivy rejected even this further compromise, again with no coherent explanations.

As defence counsel pointed out, this was not a situation where there were competing potential buyers for the shares and where Doreen and Julie needed to put up earnest money to secure an option to purchase.  Blossom and Ivy themselves had proclaimed that they had no other buyers for the shares.  This was also not a situation where the buyers of the shares were strangers to them: there was no prospect of Doreen and/or Julie running away and evading their contractual obligations once a settlement agreement was inked.  Indeed, as defence counsel pointed out in cross-examination, once the settlement agreement was signed, Blossom and Doreen would have the protection of various contractual remedies should Doreen and Julie breach their obligations. With respect, therefore, there was no reason at all for Blossom and Ivy to insist doggedly on a non-refundable 10% deposit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 To make matters worse, Ivy added to the list of demands by asserting in cross-examination that not only should Doreen and Julie give a non-refundable deposit, they also needed to give a “letter of intent” before a settlement agreement could be signed.

</div>  This was a demand which had hitherto never been put forward and which Ivy could provide no cogent explanation for when asked.  With respect, the lack of compunction which Blossom and Ivy showed about producing new demands in the midst of trial showed that they were simply determined – and perhaps spitefully so – to make things as difficult for Doreen and Julie as possible.  Their inability to reach an agreement on the sale of their shares and to exit the Companies was due to their own behaviour.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Blossom’s and Ivy’s demand for information on the details of any nominees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 A further example of Blossom’s and Ivy’s apparent determination to make things difficult for Doreen and Julie was their persistent demand that the other two must confirm not only the names of any nominees to be used in the purchase but also the number of shares such nominees would purchase in each company.  They went so far as to make it known through their lawyers that in the absence of such disclosure, they would not agree to sell their shares.

In fact, when faced with the assurance from Doreen and Julie, Ivy did an abrupt about-face: she pivoted to claiming instead that she needed to know the details of any nominees because she had concerns about “money-laundering”.

</div>  This lament, to my mind, merely exposed the insincerity of Ivy’s – and also Blossom’s – position.  If they were so intent on parting ways with Doreen and Julie that they had been prepared to look for third-party buyers for their shares, what difference did it make to them whether or not Doreen and Julie used nominees for their purchase?

</div>  In gist, in order to derive the value per share of one of the Companies, one of the factors taken into the computation was the amount of that company’s capital and reserves as at 31 December 2015.  The figure for the company’s capital and reserves consisted of two components: one would be the share capital, the other would be the retained earnings as at 31 December 2015.  The Valuation Price would thus have factored in the Companies’ retained earnings as at 31 December 2015.  In the circumstances, I agreed with the defence that Blossom’s and Ivy’s insistence on being paid dividends from the Companies’ retained earnings prior to 31 December 2015 constituted an unreasonable – indeed, unprincipled – position.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 In this connection, I noted that in cross-examination, Ivy suddenly stated that she was “now” challenging the 2016 Valuation Reports because she wanted to “[ask] for… an explanation of why” the Companies’ retained earnings should be discounted at 50%.

</div>  This belated “challenge” was in my view without merit.  Firstly, it was never raised in Ivy’s AEIC.  She herself conceded that she had not raised such a challenge “before”.  Secondly, not only was this “challenge” never mentioned in Ivy’s or for that matter Blossom’s AEIC, neither of them produced any evidence to discredit this (or any other) part of the valuation methodology in the 2016 Valuation Reports.  In fact, when Jerry was called as a witness, he was expressly reminded by counsel at the start of cross-examination that he was merely a witness of fact and not an expert witness.

</div> that the retained earnings were not “discounted at 50%” per se: what happened was that each company’s capital and reserves – which included its retained earnings as at 31 December 2015 – were factored into the computation of the value per share before a discount was applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">321 For the reasons explained above, I found that Blossom’s and Ivy’s demand for payment of dividends from the retained earnings prior to 31 December 2015 was another example of how they had put up their own obstacles to the share sale which would have permitted their exit from the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Blossom’s and Ivy’s rejection of the proposed setting aside of S$150,000 by CCH </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 Finally, Doreen and Julie had proposed that CCH set aside S$150,000 for the legal costs and contingency funds which might be needed any liabilities arising out of DC Suit 3773.  It will be recalled that this was the suit filed by one of the tenants in the RV Building.  Given that the suit was brought against CCH and that its outcome was still uncertain, the proposal that CCH set aside some funds to meet any liabilities arising from the suit appeared to me eminently reasonable.  Blossom and Ivy did not put forward any sensible reason for rejecting this proposal.  With respect, their position appeared to be another regrettable instance of a mean-spirited desire to make things as difficult for Doreen and Julie as possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 To sum up, therefore, Blossom’s and Ivy’s contention that they were “trapped” in the Companies was completely without merit. The evidence before me showed that even after their filing of the winding up applications, Doreen and Julie were still prepared to engage in negotiations in an effort settle the purchase of Blossom’s and Ivy’s shares.  It was open to Blossom and Ivy to conclude the sale of their shares and to bring about the allegedly longed-for exit from the Companies; and it was due to their own unreasonable and often spiteful behaviour that they were unable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The attacks on the 2016 Valuation Reports and on Jerry Lee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 In the course of the trial, despite having agreed to the Valuation Price being used as the basis of the purchase price for their shares and despite confirming their agreement in cross-examination, Blossom and Ivy decided – belatedly and without forewarning – to attack both the valuation methodology and Jerry Lee’s impartiality.  It is necessary for me to put on record my disapprobation of these tactics.  The objections and challenges to the 2016 Valuation Report – and to Jerry’s impartiality – were never pleaded.  Nor were they elucidated in Blossom’s and Ivy’s AEICs.  They also chose not to call any expert witness to testify on any alleged flaws in the valuation methodology employed in the 2016 Valuation Reports.  Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, their counsel took pains to point out to Jerry at the start of cross-examination that he was only a witness of fact and not an independent expert.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 Given the serious nature of the challenges which then emerged in counsel’s cross-examination, and in particular the attacks on Jerry’s professional integrity, the relevant allegations should have been pleaded so that the defence would not be subject to litigation by ambush.  With respect, by choosing to keep these serious allegations “in reserve” until Jerry was on the witness stand, Blossom and Ivy displayed a lack of good faith.  Indeed, having agreed to the use of the Valuation Price as the basis for the purchase price, it was an audacious act of duplicity for them suddenly to declare – through their counsel during Jerry’s cross-examination – that the 2016 Valuation Report should not be relied on “partly because of the circumstances and also because it is out of date”.

</div>  From defence counsel’s reaction, it was clear that this volte-face came as a bolt from the blue.  I certainly did not think the complete absence of any forewarning to the defence could be excused simply by the assertion that Blossom and Ivy had prayed in their statement of claim for the alternative remedy of a share buy-out on “terms to the satisfaction of the court”:

To put it bluntly, there was no excuse for these guerilla tactics.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 For these reasons alone, I would have had no hesitation in dismissing the challenges to the 2016 Valuation Reports and to Jerry’s impartiality.  However, given that counsel sought to bring up these challenges several times in Jerry’s cross-examination, I would make it clear that I found no merit in these challenges in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 Briefly, in the course of cross-examination, counsel for Blossom and Ivy apparently sought to impugn the application of the discount by Jerry in the 2016 Valuation Reports by pointing out that it was a different rate of discount from that applied in an earlier report he had produced on 23 September 2013.

</div>  This 2013 valuation report had been produced for the purpose of facilitating the Sisters’ purchase of Mother’s shares.  Counsel’s point appeared to be that Jerry had applied a lower rate of discount in the 2013 valuation report, as compared to the rate applied in the 2016 report.  Jerry explained, however, that there was a sound reason for the difference: basically, the rates of discount applied for shares of listed companies in 2013 were a different set of figures from those applied for shares of listed companies in 2016.

</div>  This appeared to me to be a reasonable explanation.  It was not suggested to Jerry that the figures used in the 2016 Valuation Reports were fake or made-up in some way.  Moreover, since Blossom and Ivy had elected not to adduce an expert witness to give an opinion on the 2016 Valuation Reports, they had no evidential basis for challenging the figures used by Jerry in arriving at the rate of discount in the 2016 reports – or for that matter, the size of the discount itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 As for the attack on Jerry’s impartiality, this was equally baseless.  In brief, during Jerry’s cross-examination, counsel for Blossom and Ivy brought up the fact that he had a longstanding friendship with Doreen, and that she had lent him money at one point for which she had sued him for repayment.

</div>  The insinuation appeared to be that Jerry was therefore beholden to Doreen and biased in her favour when he produced the 2016 Valuation Report.  Counsel initially suggested to Jerry that Doreen had told him the valuation report was to be produced for the purposes of a buy-out, that Doreen was “<span class="font-italic">seeking to fix a number</span>” for the shares to be bought “at a discount”,

</div>  However, when it was highlighted that these allegations had never been pleaded, he sought instead to couch them, not as an accusation of bias and conspiracy, but as a “suggestion” that Jerry had given “a much larger discount” in the 2016 report “compared to 2013 … in the context of what Doreen had communicated to him”.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 I found this suggestion to be baseless.  Jerry himself readily agreed that Doreen had told him the 2016 Valuation Reports was for a sale and purchase of shares.  He also recalled that one or some of the other Sisters had told him the same thing (although he could not recall whom exactly).  Clearly, he did not view Doreen’s statement to him about a sale and purchase of shares as a secret to be kept between them.  He also explained that he had not informed the other Sisters of the loan from Doreen because he had viewed his personal indebtedness to Doreen as being separate from the professional engagement of NLA for the drafting of the Valuation Reports; and in any case, he had not been swayed by Doreen in drafting the reports.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 The fact that Jerry had known Doreen for many years was also no secret: this was something which would have been known to Blossom and Ivy at the point they obtained the 2016 Valuation Reports.  Furthermore, the existence of a longstanding relationship in itself would not be sufficient reason to reject the 2016 Valuation Reports.  In <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping</span>, for example, the CoA held (at [116]) that the existence of a longstanding relationship between one of the parties and the company auditor who had certified a certain “fair value” for the shares was not a reason <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to reject the value given by the auditor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">331 In addition, the suit which Doreen filed against Jerry in August 2017 and the repayment of a personal loan – and the default judgement she obtained against him in November 2017 – would have been a matter of public record.  In other words, Blossom and Ivy had ample opportunity at all material times to make known their distrust of Jerry’s position vis-à-vis the drafting of the reports and/or their rejection of the reports.  They never did so, which suggested that they had no issue with Jerry’s professionalism and integrity.  In cross-examination, Doreen did not appear at all evasive about her longstanding relationship with Jerry and the loan she had given him.  On the contrary, she was forthright in revealing that she had sued Jerry in relation to the loan so that she could preserve her claim against his estate in the event of his death.  This was because she had been told of his ill health following a stroke and had been advised to take action before he passed on.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">332 Lastly, although counsel for Blossom and Ivy contended in cross-examination that the 2016 Valuation Reports were “out of date” and that “now the company prices have moved”, no evidence was produced by either Blossom or Ivy of the alleged current “company prices”.  Again, they had ample opportunity to obtain an independent expert opinion to substantiate the contention that the Valuation Price was “out of date” – but they chose not to do so.  In fact, as I have already noted, they chose not to say anything about this in their pleadings, and even confirmed during the trial that parties had agreed on a purchase price based on the 2016 Valuation Price.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">333 For the reasons explained, I found Blossom’s and Doreen’s challenge to the 2016 Valuation Reports – and their attacks on Jerry’s impartiality – to be devoid of merit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Doreen and Julie “reneged on the Share Swap”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">334 Lastly, I note that in the Statement of Claim, it was pleaded that Doreen and Julie had “reneged on the Share Swap”.

Having found against them on all these issues, I should also make it clear that I saw no other reason to warrant the winding up of the Companies.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 It was not disputed that all four Companies were viable going concerns; that the properties owned by CCH, YP and TBL were all fully paid-up and unencumbered; and that each of the company possessed total equity ranging from S$500,000 (in CCM’s case) to nearly S$16 million (in TBL’s case).  As I noted earlier, whilst CCH’s, YP’s and CCM’s revenue had dipped in the last few years due to the remedial and repair works being conducted within the RV Building, it was not disputed that as at the time of the trial, CCM had already started marketing the building to prospective tenants; and given its popular location (on River Valley Road), there appeared to be no reason to disbelieve Doreen’s and Julie’s assertions that CCH and YP would be able to resume generating rental revenue once all works were completed.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">337 Having regard to the circumstances, and given the drastic effects of a winding up order, I was unable to conclude that the winding up of the Companies would be “the best solution for all the parties involved”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">338 I have earlier also noted that where the attempt to invoke s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) is made in the case of a company that is a going concern, the court may look to see if there is a motive behind the application: <span class="font-italic">per</span> the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Leong Soon</span> (at [53]).  From the evidence available, it appeared to me that Blossom and Ivy did not really want the winding up of the Companies.  Rather, as I alluded to earlier, their filing of the winding up applications was simply another of the tactics they deployed to ratchet up the pressure on Doreen and Julie.  I have explained earlier my finding that on 10 February 2017, they had indicated their willingness to sell their CCH and YP shares – but when Doreen and Julie offered to buy these shares on 14 March 2017, their letter was met with baffling accusations about lack of authentication and misuse of company resources.  This then led to further negotiations for the sale and purchase of all of Blossom’s and Ivy’s shares in the four Companies.  These further negotiations again came to naught when Blossom and Ivy (who had earlier been willing to sell their CCH and YP shares at the Valuation Price) refused to name their price and insisted that the other two state a price first.  It was Blossom and Ivy who called off the further negotiations and filed the winding up applications.  Even so, Doreen and Julie continued to engage them in negotiations for the purchase of their shares; and with the agreement on the Valuation Price as the basis for the purchase price, parties had appeared to move closer to conclusion of the sale and purchase – until Blossom and Ivy dropped another bombshell at trial by challenging the Valuation Price and arguing that the 2016 Valuation Reports should not be relied on.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">339 In short, from the manner in which Blossom and Ivy had conducted themselves throughout the pre-trial negotiations up till the trial itself, it was plain that having agreed to use the Valuation Price as the basis of the share purchase price, they nevertheless hoped to get a better deal by using the litigation process to get an order for a higher buy-out price.  This would explain, in particular, the startling attacks launched during the trial on the 2016 Valuation Reports and on Jerry Lee’s impartiality.  The existence of such a collateral purpose constituted another factor which – considered in the round with the other relevant matters I have dealt with – persuaded me that it would not be “just and equitable” to grant the application for winding up: see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Leong Soon</span> at [27] (citing <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping</span> at [77] and <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span><span class="font-italic"> (Capitol)</span> at [38]).       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">340 Given my findings above and given that the test for ordering a winding up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) CA could not be satisfied by Blossom and Ivy, there was also no basis for me to make any order under s 254(2A) for the buy-out of their shares: see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Leong Soon</span> at [28].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">341 Having regard to the reasoning and findings I have set out in these written grounds, I dismissed Blossom’s and Ivy’s action in Suit 925 of 2018.  As costs should follow the event, I ordered that Blossom and Ivy were to pay the costs of the action to the Defendants.  I directed that the quantum of these costs would be fixed by me if parties were unable to come to an agreement within 14 days of my decision.  As none of the parties has written in to ask that I fix costs, it would appear that costs have been agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Maw Shen and Mark Jerome Seah Wei Hsien (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Sim Chong and Joan Tee (Sim Chong LLC) (instructed), Singh Ranjit and Ravleen Kaur Khaira (Francis Khoo &amp; Lim) for the 1st and 2nd defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
