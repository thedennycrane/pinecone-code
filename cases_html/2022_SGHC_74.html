More information would have been needed on the financing options, and the board would only have acted after a review of all the relevant information and an analysis of the same. At a series of board meetings from 30 January 2019 to 4 June 2019, the Rabobank Loan Facility was discussed. Various members of the board had reservations about the key terms of the Rabobank Loan Facility, including the financial covenants and repayment schedule, and they wanted an understanding of CSAPL’s financial position. Mr Jagetia failed to address the concerns of the board which, as SVP of CSAPL, was for him to do. Mr Jagetia was not blocked in the Financing Efforts.

When Mr Jagetia brought up the issues at a board meeting, Mr Steenberg mentioned that there is no mention in the CSAPL SVP Contract or the CSAPL’s shareholders agreement that all information “needs to go through [the] SVP”. In any case, it would be “entirely unpractical as it will create an unnecessary bottle neck to make one person the sole contact for all information”. As a multinational corporation, “nowhere in the company is there one person that all communications go through”.

For context, it is not seriously disputed that the STI from January 2018 to March 2018 while Mr Jagetia was DMD of CIPL (the “CIPL STI”) is still due to him. The first dispute is over which entity is liable to make the payment (whether CSAPL or otherwise). Mr Jagetia takes the view that CSAPL should pay him S$114,800 for the CIPL STI.

The legal test for implication of a term in fact<span class="font-italic"> </span>is well-established. In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”), a three-step process is set out (at [101]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Finally, at the third step, the court considers the specific term to be implied. The term must be one to which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had it been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this regard, the first step cannot be glossed over or sidestepped. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>took pains to caution that “not all gaps in a contract are “true” gaps in the sense that they can be remedied by the implication of a term” (at [94]). Specifically, while there are at least the following three ways in which a gap could arise, it is only in the first scenario where it would be appropriate for the court to even consider if it will imply a term into the parties’ contract (at [94]–[95]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the parties did not contemplate the issue at all and so left a gap;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide a term for it because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had adequately addressed it; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide any term for it because they could not agree on a solution.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To round off, in implying a term, the court essentially gives effect to the parties’ presumed intentions by filling the gaps in the contract (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> at [93]). Consequently, the threshold for implying a term is necessarily a high one<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [100]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I should also touch briefly on the legal principles of unjust enrichment. In <span class="font-italic">Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Benzline</span>”), the Court of Appeal reiterated that a claim in unjust enrichment against a defendant requires (a) enrichment of the defendant, (b) at the expense of the plaintiff, and (c) circumstances which make the enrichment unjust (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presence of an “unjust factor”) (at [45]). One such “unjust factor” is the “failure of basis”. That inquiry has two parts: first, what was the basis for the transfer in respect of which restitution is sought; and second, whether that basis failed (at [46]). While it is less settled whether the failure of basis must be “total” (and not merely “partial”), any such uncertainty is merely academic in this case. CSAPL’s pleaded case is that there was a total failure of basis for the Annual Benefits Package in that Mr Jagetia failed to relocate to Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 With the foregoing principles in mind, I turn to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 CSAPL’s position is that, “as evidenced by the negotiations”, Mr Jagetia’s entire Annual Benefits Package was to be paid on the basis of the Relocation Obligation.

</div> In this regard, a consideration relevant to the officious bystander test is whether the implied term is “capable of clear expression” (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [98]). At the trial, CSAPL alluded to the meaning of “permanent accommodation”, “reside in Singapore”, “live in Singapore” and “working out of Singapore”. In any event, broadly speaking, Mr Jagetia claims that he had relocated to Singapore.

</div> In any case, it is evident by cl 1.4 of the CSAPL SVP Contract that parties “had contemplated the relocation issue” by qualifying the phrase “accompanying family” with “if any”. As such, despite knowing that Mr Jagetia had a wife and two children, the CSAPL SVP Contract “did not expressly require that the [Mr Jagetia’s] family must move to Singapore”.

The disagreement lies in whether there was any common understanding reached that Mr Jagetia was contractually obligated to relocate with his family to Singapore. However, if I were to accept CSAPL’s submission that the parties had a common understanding with respect to the Relocation Obligation, then the parties’ lack of contemplation was merely in respect of “recording that understanding as a term”. This does not and cannot satisfy the first stage of the test for implying a term in fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 To elaborate, CSAPL’s position is not that parties did not contemplate the issue at all, and therefore left a gap to be filled: as per [47(a)] above. Instead, the parties had indeed contemplated the particular question of an obligation to relocate. As CSAPL points out, numerous clauses in the contract, such as cll 1.1, 1.4, 4.1, 6.5, and 6.9, hint at this. Indeed, CSAPL admits that what parties failed to contemplate was the “<span class="font-italic">recording</span>” of the alleged common understanding. Thus, it appears to me that the parties chose not to clearly provide any term requiring relocation in the sense that CSAPL now contends. In my judgment, CSAPL’s admission is fatal to their own pleaded claim. I digress to observe that in relation to the CIPL DMD Contract, CIPL reserved the right to require Mr Jagetia to reside in a specified location. However, this is omitted from the CSAPL SVP Contract. The circumstances of the present case thus fall outside the situation which <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>envisions at [94] (see [47(a)] above). In other words, the “gap” which CSAPL contends is not<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>a “true gap” which the court may fill by way of implying a term in fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In any event, in my judgment, the question of whether there was any common understanding between the parties that Mr Jagetia would relocate with his family to Singapore must also be answered in the negative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 First, I agree that cl 1.4 of the CSAPL SVP Contract plainly contradicts any such common understanding. To reiterate, cl 1.4 provides that CSAPL is to assist Mr Jagetia “and accompanying family, <span class="font-italic">if any</span>, in obtaining proper documentation” [emphasis added]. In that regard, the qualifier “if any” plainly indicates that Mr Jagetia’s family members might not be relocating to Singapore with him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Second, I am not satisfied that the Annual Benefits Package was solely to compensate Mr Jagetia and his family for their relocation and for no other reason. On the contrary, I am satisfied that the undisputed evidence as a whole (including the background of the negotiation for Mr Jagetia’s compensation package) supports Mr Jagetia’s position that the three components (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Gross Annual Base Salary, STI and Annual Benefits Package) were intended to be read as a whole for compensation given his increased portfolio (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as SVP of CSAPL) from his previous position as DMD of CIPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this regard, it is common ground that initially, CSAPL offered a remuneration package comprising of a S$350,000 annual base salary, STI worth potentially S$140,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>target of 40% of S$350,000), and S$255,000 as the Annual Benefits Package.

As such, at all material times whilst parties were drafting the terms of remuneration under the CSAPL SVP Contract, it is clear that the parties’ <span class="font-italic">common</span> understanding<span class="font-italic"> </span>was that the three components were to be taken together in order to justifiably peg Mr Jagetia’s compensation package to that of CIPL’s MD.

Mr Low explained to Mr Fewkes that his “new approach” essentially “mirrors the 10% delta between [Mr Jagetia] and [CIPL MD]”.

</div> Indeed, I should also point out that other clauses in the CSAPL SVP Contract are expressly linked to living in Singapore. For example, cl 6.6 provides specifically for the installation of a telephone <span class="font-italic">in Singapore</span> to be reimbursed by CSAPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For these reasons, CSAPL’s submission that there is a common understanding that Mr Jagetia would relocate with his family to Singapore is unpersuasive. Implying the Relocation Obligation would therefore be contrary to the parties’ presumed intentions, which are of paramount importance: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [93]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Based on the analysis above, the Relocation Obligation cannot be implied in fact.

The Annual Benefits Package was not paid to Mr Jagetia to compensate for his and his family’s relocation to Singapore. Since I do not find the Annual Benefits Package “tied to” the performance of the Relocation Obligation as CSAPL contends, CSAPL’s claim for the recovery of the Annual Benefits Package, based both on breach of the implied term and alternatively in unjust enrichment for total failure of consideration, fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether CSAPL may recover the Relocation Allowance paid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As regards the claim for the Relocation Allowance, I accept CSAPL’s position that payment is contingent “[u]pon relocation to Singapore” as clearly stipulated in cl 6.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract. Nevertheless, cl 6.5 does not go so far as to stipulate in what circumstances Mr Jagetia would be considered to have fulfilled the obligation contained in this clause. It also does not state when Mr Jagetia must do so. Mr Jagetia’s obligation under cl 6.5 cannot be determined from a reading of the clause on its own, without more. I thus look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether Mr Jagetia had satisfied his obligations under cl 6.5. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In this connection, I note that CSAPL is a Singapore incorporated holding company, and the business entities are CIPL and GBPL (which operate out of India and Nepal respectively). Therefore, Mr Jagetia’s role and responsibilities did not require him to be physically present in Singapore. Indeed, Mr Yeo agreed that Mr Jagetia “could have carried out his function” from India.

</div> Although it is quite clear that Mr Jagetia’s family did not relocate to Singapore, whether, for the purpose of cl 6.5, Mr Jagetia himself had relocated to Singapore is a more vexed question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Mr Jagetia argues that he has relocated to Singapore by (a) obtaining a Singapore employment pass; (b) spending more days employed in Singapore than outside Singapore based on his tax assessment on 14 August 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 275 days employed in Singapore); and (c) being tax resident in Singapore. CSAPL, however, strongly denies that Mr Jagetia could be said to have relocated. In that regard, his tax assessment for the year 2018 shows that Mr Jagetia was “only in Singapore for 70 days” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 205 of 275 days outside Singapore for business purposes).

</div> Even as late as 12 September 2018, CSAPL agreed to the rental of a company car in India for Mr Jagetia’s work with CIPL (which Mr Jagetia had been “provided by CIPL since 2014” on lease) until March 2019. As Mr Jagetia explained, this is to account for his presence in India “approx. 10 days/month for various projects/meetings” and helps “avoid taxi costs”. In that regard, Mr Low affirmed that CSAPL is “ok with [the] arrangement for leased car to be paid by CIPL until Mar 19”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Relocation Allowance was “paid with the first available payroll”. On the objective evidence before me as set out above, I am satisfied that at all material times thereafter, CSAPL was agreeable to Mr Jagetia being (a) tax resident in Singapore; and (b) travelling to Singapore and staying in India for significant periods in fulfilment of the “relocation” under cl 6.5. It bears emphasising that CSAPL did not even provide Mr Jagetia with a serviced office in Singapore until November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I briefly deal with CSAPL’s further argument that relocation is a “specific type of consideration” which entails “uprooting” which Mr Jagetia failed to do.

</div>
</div> In my judgment, it is too late for CSAPL to now contend that relocation under cl 6.5 can only be fulfilled by the “uprooting” of Mr Jagetia and his family. Even on CSAPL’s own case, it is wholly unclear what such “uprooting” would entail given the overall circumstances of the present case – Mr Jagetia was unable to secure his employment pass until some months after the CSAPL SVP Contract was entered into, and CSAPL approved of Mr Jagetia’s request to continue leasing a company car in India until March 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Accordingly, CSAPL’s claim for recovery of the Relocation Allowance based on a breach of cl 6.5, and the alternative claim for unjust enrichment fail. For completeness, even if Mr Jagetia did not “uproot” himself to move to Singapore to the extent that CSAPL now desires, it is undisputed that Mr Jagetia was present in Singapore for a substantial period of at least 70 days (out of 275 days for which he was employed in Singapore) (see [74] above). Such stay in Singapore cannot constitute a total failure of consideration as CSAPL now contends.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to the Repatriation Allowance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I now turn to Mr Jagetia’s counterclaims.

</div> In response, Mr Jagetia submits that CSAPL’s argument is neither pleaded nor applicable on the facts since CSAPL was not entitled to terminate him under cl 11.5. For the reasons which I shall elaborate below, I agree with Mr Jagetia that CSAPL was not entitled to terminate him under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract. As the flip side to the Relocation Allowance, I am also satisfied that Mr Jagetia is likewise entitled to the Repatriation Allowance under cl 6.5 at the end of the CSAPL SVP Contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to the Annual Benefits Package from 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Mr Jagetia submits that the Annual Benefits Package is “payable in full on 1st April every year” having regard to cl 6.3 of the CSAPL SVP Contract and not every quarter of the year.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 While it is not disputed that cl 6.3 stipulates the mechanics for the payment of the Annual Benefits Package (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, promptly on 1 April as a one-time lump payment for the year), such mechanism does not and cannot in any way lead to the conclusion that Mr Jagetia is entitled to the full sum of the Annual Benefits Package for as long as the contract ends after 1 April of the year. On the contrary, cl 6.5 clearly stipulates that the figure of S$290,000 is “per annum” and as such appropriately called the <span class="font-italic">Annual</span> Benefits Package. Furthermore, Mr Jagetia’s position on this part of his Counterclaim is contradicted by his own position (which I have found earlier) that his remuneration package is to be considered as a whole<span class="font-italic"> </span>so as to justifiably peg it to the “10% delta difference” compared to the CIPL MD. Such remuneration package is clearly in respect of Mr Jagetia’s annual remuneration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Furthermore, even if CSAPL’s failure to pay the full sum of the Annual Benefits Package on 1 April constitutes a breach of cl 6.5, in the present circumstances, I am not satisfied that Mr Jagetia has shown any loss for the period from 1 July 2019 to 31 March 2020. In that regard, I also rely on my decision to allow Mr Jagetia’s three months’ salary in lieu of notice (see [148] below). Accordingly, I dismiss Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim for the remainder of the Annual Benefits Package.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The quantum of the CSAPL 2018 STI </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Turning to the CSAPL 2018 STI Claim, parties disagree on the quantum payable to Mr Jagetia. In this connection, cl 7.1 of the CSAPL SVP Contract only provides for a “a target bonus of 40% of the Gross Annual Base Salary”. As for “mechanics and calculations”, the contract leaves it open for yearly discussion with the board, with oversight by Mr Fewkes. Nonetheless, cl 7.1 provides that as a “base assumption”, “the STI structure will reflect financial performance of [CIPL] and [GBPL] and CSAPL priorities in equal proportions”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30, the employee claimed a bonus based on a bonus clause which read “[i]n addition to your salary, a bonus <span class="font-italic">may</span> be paid to you…” [emphasis added]. Based on a proper construction of the bonus clause, the Court of Appeal held that the decision to grant a bonus was entirely at the discretion of the company. An employee was not entitled to claim against his former employer a bonus which was entirely discretionary in nature. In this regard, the Court of Appeal held that even if the employee had continued to work with the employer, he “would not have a legal right to claim a bonus from them, much less if his employment was terminated in accordance with the terms of the contract” (at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In determining whether bonuses are entirely discretionary in nature, I gather the following relevant principles from the case law. While there may be situations in which an employer reserves the absolute right to declare bonuses in whatever way he deems fit, all the relevant circumstances have to be examined to ascertain whether that was the true intention of the parties (<span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee v Citra Group Pte Ltd and others</span> [2015] 2 SLR 603 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span>”) at [147] and [150]). Thus, the discretion in awarding a bonus may not be completely unfettered. Even a very broad discretion should nevertheless be exercised rationally, in <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>and not arbitrarily or capriciously (<span class="font-italic">Leiman, Ricardo and another v Noble Resources Ltd and another</span> [2018] SGHC 166 (“<span class="font-italic">Leiman</span>”) at [250]). Although such discretion may not be unfettered, the threshold for judicial intervention in the exercise of such discretion is not low, and the courts will generally not intervene unless the contracting party’s exercise of such discretion is “so outrageous in its defiance of reason that it can be properly categorised as perverse” (<span class="font-italic">Dong Wei v Shell Eastern Trading (Pte) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2022] SGHC(A) 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span>”) at [90] citing <span class="font-italic">MGA International Pte Ltd v Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2010] SGHC 319 at [106]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On the computation of the STI, the parties refer to the discussions between them, as supervised by Mr Fewkes. This is in line with what is set out in cl 7.1 of the CSAPL SVP Contract.

</div> In that regard, the CSAPL component does not provide for any contingencies where the personal objectives were unmet as a result of<span class="font-italic"> </span>factors beyond Mr Jagetia’s control. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether CSAPL retained any discretion to depart from the STI payout awarded to the GBPL MD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It is common ground between parties that Mr Jagetia’s STI payout is meant to “mirror” that of the GBPL MD. It is thus likewise common ground between parties that CSAPL did not have the discretion to compute the GBPL component in any manner which it wanted to. Indeed, even on Mr Fewkes’ evidence, the GBPL component is “mechanically” calculated. As such, any discretion was necessarily fettered by the STI awarded to the GBPL MD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The fundamental dispute is in respect of what such “mirroring” entailed in the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the interpretation of the term “mirroring”). Stated thus, it is clear that CSAPL did not have the discretion to award the GBPL component in a manner which failed to “mirror” that of the GBPL MD. While Mr Jagetia’s position is that such “mirroring” means that he was to be awarded a GBPL component based directly on the GBPL MD’s STI payout, CSAPL’s position is that such “mirroring” is satisfied precisely because the GBPL MD would have likewise been awarded an STI payout calculated with a 0% multiplicand if he was on the same “local” STI plan as Mr Jagetia (and not the CBAS STI plan). To explain, the “local” STI plan is meant to take into account only the performance of GBPL, whereas the CBAS STI plan would have taken into account the performance of the Carlsberg Group. CSAPL also explained that the GBPL MD was meant to transition to the “local” STI plan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I am unable to agree with CSAPL’s position that the GBPL component for Mr Jagetia’s STI could be said to have “mirrored” that of the GBPL MD on the basis that two different regimes applied to each person. The objective and contemporaneous evidence before me concerning Mr Jagetia’s STI before and up to the time of contracting clearly demonstrates that parties intended for the GBPL component to be directly pegged to that of the GBPL MD. In particular, Mr Fewkes had himself represented to Mr Jagetia that he <span class="font-italic">in effect</span> “would get 50% of the India STI payout, <span class="font-italic">25% of Nepal MD’s STI payout</span> and 25% based on CSAPL deliverables [emphasis added]” as his 2018 STI (see the 17 April 2018 E-mail at [86] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Crucially, there was no explanation (or even any mention) of the differences between the GBPL MD’s “CBAS” STI plan and Mr Jagetia’s “local” STI plan at the material time. Needless to say, there was likewise no explanation to Mr Jagetia before and up to the point of contracting that such difference in plan would mean that Mr Jagetia could have in effect received a 0% multiplicand regardless of the actual STI payout which the GBPL MD received. I am unable to see how applying altogether different STI plans (which leads to the different multiplicands applicable)<span class="font-italic"> </span>could in any way be coherent with Mr Fewkes’ representation that Mr Jagetia will receive “25% of Nepal MD’s STI payout”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the totality of the circumstances, I find that CSAPL did not have the discretion to award a 0% multiplicand to Mr Jagetia. In doing so, CSAPL failed to “mirror” the STI awarded to the GBPL MD. That said, I briefly clarify that this does not mean that the decision on the GBPL component was necessarily motivated by the desire to “punish” Mr Jagetia in relation to the Collateral Purposes – nor need I say more on the alleged Collateral Purposes in order to determine the issue. For the foregoing reasons, I find that Mr Jagetia is entitled to the GBPL STI component based on a multiplicand of 89.18%.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to a multiplicand of 100% for the CSAPL component</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It is undisputed that the applicable multiplicand depends directly on the achievement of the three objectives mentioned earlier in the table at [88] above. For Mr Jagetia to be entitled to a 100% multiplicand, he must show that<span class="font-italic"> </span>he met all three of the objectives. On the flipside, the failure to achieve even one of the objectives would lead to the conclusion that the CSAPL board is entitled to award him the CSAPL component based on a multiplicand of 50%. In that regard, it is undisputed that the CSAPL board retains the discretion to determine whether a particular objective has been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I find that the CSAPL board exercised its discretion reasonably in considering that not all of the objectives had been met. As for the third objective, I am not persuaded by Mr Jagetia’s arguments that obtaining board approval for three proposals presented by two of his subordinates must necessarily amount to the successful meeting of the third objective – such that the decision to the contrary must have been tainted by bias as a result of the Collateral Purposes on the balance of probabilities. In that regard, Mr Jagetia’s fails to demonstrate that the CSAPL board’s decision is “a biased one-sided report in an attempt to justify a low STI payout”.

</div> Quite to the contrary, I find that a reasonable and fair-minded employer might assess such examples as insufficient to amount to the successful “implementation of at least 2 meaningful business development projects in India and/or Nepal”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It must be emphasised that the court will not readily intervene with the exercise of discretion (see <span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span> at [90], as mentioned at [85] above). In this regard, I find that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Clark v Nomura International plc</span> [2000] IRLR 766 at [40], wherein it was held that the employer was in breach of its contractual obligations in respect of a discretionary performance-based bonus and endorsed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Daniel John Brader and others v Commerzbank AG</span> [2014] 2 SLR 81 at [102], to be helpful: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">My conclusion is that the right test is one of irrationality or perversity (of which caprice or capriciousness would be a good example) ie that no reasonable employer would have exercised his discretion in this way</span>. … Such test of perversity or irrationality is not only one which is simple, or at any rate simpler, to understand and apply, but it is a familiar one, being that regularly applied in the Crown Office or, as it is soon to be, the Administrative Court.

The same may be said of the other two objectives, to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In respect of the first and second objectives, it is undisputed that the objectives were not met. The only dispute between the parties is whether the failure to meet such objectives should be overlooked. In my judgment, that inquiry must be answered in the negative. I am not convinced that the CSAPL board is required, under the CSAPL SVP Contract, to determine that an objective is met in the event that the failure<span class="font-italic"> </span>to meet such objective was due to some other external factor beyond Mr Jagetia’s control as Mr Jagetia contends. Even if the objectives are described as “personal”, it is wholly unsurprising that someone working within the top managerial positions of a company is expected to work with other employees to drive tasks forward and complete them. As such, I find difficulty accepting Mr Jagetia’s assertion that the CSAPL component must be decided by such a granular inquiry of scrutinising the precise reasons for failure before determining, on the whole, whether the personal objectives were met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As such, I reject Mr Jagetia’s contention that he is entitled to a multiplicand of 100% for this portion of his STI.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Quantum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 From the foregoing, I allow Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim for the CSAPL 2018 STI in part.

For context, at a board meeting on 6 May 2019, Mr Stollberg stated that “any claim for CIPL employment’s bonus January to March 2018”, should be resolved with CIPL as the CSAPL board was concerned only with “the CSAPL part of [Mr Jagetia’s] employment”. Mr Steenberg further clarified that “CSAPL cannot pay a bonus for a contract not related to CSAPL”. Mr Yeo responded that under the CSAPL SVP Contract, Mr Jagetia’s “role with CSAPL was a continuation of [his] contract with CIPL and will be counted from 26 September 2014” (see cl 1.3 at [9] above). Nevertheless, the CBAS nominated directors all voted in favour of Mr Stollberg’s proposal that there be no CIPL STI payable by CSAPL.

Further, extrinsic evidence is only admissible if it satisfies the three requirements of being relevant, reasonably available to all contracting parties, and if it relates to a clear and obvious context (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B</span><span class="font-italic">-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [132(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Turning to cll 1.2, 1.3 and 7.1, I am persuaded that read together, they impose a liability on CSAPL to pay the CIPL STI. I start by considering the text of the clauses. Clause 1.2 specifically provides that the CSAPL SVP Contract “<span class="font-italic">supersedes</span>” the CIPL DMD Contract, and that “[i]n the event of any inconsistency”, the former will prevail. By a plain reading, this means that the CSAPL SVP Contract <span class="font-italic">replaces</span> the CIPL DMD Contract. However, CSAPL and CIPL are separate legal entities; CSAPL is a third-party to the CIPL DMD Contract with no rights, liabilities and obligations under the CIPL DMD Contract. Therefore, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, there was no reason to include cl 1.2 at all. Nonetheless, parties deliberately chose to include cl 1.2. This raises the question of what aspects of the CIPL DMD Contract are to be replaced by the CSAPL SVP Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Moving to cl 1.3, it backdates the CSAPL SVP Contract, providing for Mr Jagetia’s length of employment to count from 26 September 2014, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the date of the CIPL DMD Contract. As explained by Mr Yeo at [109] above, I find that this captures the parties’ agreement that the CSAPL SVP Contract is to be a continuation of employment from the CIPL DMD Contract (even though the CIPL DMD Contract is itself superseded by the CSAPL SVP Contract). In that regard, Mr Stollberg’s evidence (which is consistent with Mr Low’s evidence) is that the intention behind both cll 1.2 and 1.3 is that they were together a “seniority clause”. I find it difficult to accept CSAPL’s position since, even if there was a need to include a “seniority clause”, cl 1.2 is not strictly necessary. On the flip side, a “seniority clause” begs the question of the entitlements which Mr Jagetia would enjoy due to his seniority. For instance, this could potentially include the non-forfeiture of the CIPL STI, especially given that parties agree that their intention was for Mr Jagetia to retain the CIPL STI despite taking up the position of SVP CSAPL on 1 April 2018. Furthermore, and more fundamentally, CSAPL’s witnesses fail to satisfactorily explain the purpose for recognising Mr Jagetia’s seniority within the CSAPL SVP Contract. It seems to me that read together, the CSAPL SVP Contract provides for any outstanding obligation of CIPL (which is not inconsistent with its terms) to be undertaken by CSAPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Rounding off, cl 7.1 provides for Mr Jagetia’s entitlement to STI, and leaves the question of “STI mechanics and calculations” to the board, with oversight by Mr Fewkes. Read together with cll 1.2 and 1.3, the “STI” referred to in cl 7.1 (which is not confined to any time period) could and should include the entire period of Mr Jagetia’s employment under the CSAPL SVP Contract (which is backdated to 26 September 2014). Therefore, payment of any outstanding STI is not excluded from the CSAPL SVP Contract. Indeed, I would say that the CIPL STI for Mr Jagetia’s work from January to March 2018 is contemplated within the CSAPL SVP Contract (with the quantum to be determined by the parties). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The conclusion I reach is fortified by the context. Parties do not dispute that the 17 April 2018 E-mail satisfies the <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>requirements. Indeed, both parties rely on it. In it, Mr Fewkes set out the “2018 STI proposal”, which was meant for discussion before Mr Low was to “write it up”. Mr Fewkes stated “Jan-Mar : 25% pro-rata on final India stretch STI payout ([Mr Low] to confirm if this should be budgeted by CIPL or CSAPL)”. He added that “in practical terms, … for 2018 … [Mr Jagetia] would get 50% of the India STI payout, 25% of Nepal MD’s STI payout and 25% based on CSAPL deliverables” (see [86] above). In my view, Mr Fewkes had expressly represented to Mr Jagetia that the CIPL STI payable for January to March 2018 would be incorporated into the CSAPL SVP Contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Although Mr Fewkes also said that Mr Low was to confirm if the CIPL STI should be budgeted by CIPL or CSAPL, I agree with Mr Jagetia that this is but a budgeting matter between two companies in the same group (to be resolved<span class="font-italic"> </span>between CSAPL<span class="font-italic"> </span>and CIPL). It is for CSAPL (and not Mr Jagetia) to work out a suitable arrangement to finance the CIPL STI. Although it appears that Mr Fewkes did not follow up with Mr Low, CSAPL cannot rely on any difficulty on its part to fulfil its contractual obligations to defeat Mr Jagetia’s claim for the CIPL STI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 To round off, I note that cl 4.3 of the CIPL DMD Contract provides that Mr Jagetia “will not be eligible to receive Performance Pay if [he is] no longer employed by [CIPL]”. Mr Low states that under cl 4.3 “after [Mr Jagetia] leaves CIPL employment he cannot claim CIPL STI”.

</div> Further, the CSAPL SVP Contract also expressly provides that the CIPL DMD Contract is superseded. Yet, I also note CSAPL’s view that there is no intention for Mr Jagetia to forfeit his CIPL STI altogether. Such context supports the finding that by the terms of the CSAPL SVP Contract, CSAPL had undertaken CIPL’s liability for the CIPL STI. I should add that even if there is any ambiguity within the CSAPL SVP Contract, by the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentum </span>rule, any ambiguity must be resolved against CSAPL who drafted the CSAPL SVP Contract and additionally represented to Mr Jagetia that he is entitled to the CIPL STI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In terms of quantum, CSAPL belatedly argue that Mr Jagetia erred in his calculation for the CIPL STI. CSAPL submitted that the 2018 STI Plan “only applies to him as an employee of [CSAPL] from 1 April 2018” and thus he has “no right to demand that a 280% multiplicand be applied to him for his CIPL STI, which is for the period from January to March 2018”.

</div> I am unable to agree with such contention since the objective evidence before me leads to the conclusion that Mr Jagetia’s CIPL STI will simply be pro-rated, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>“25% pro-rata on final India stretch STI payout” as per the 17 April 2018 E-mail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Furthermore, such argument is contradicted by CSAPL’s own internal correspondence on the issue.

</div> On 1 May 2019, the CBAS nominated directors calculated Mr Jagetia’s STI from January to December 2018 based on a one-third weightage for each of the CIPL multiplicand, GBPL multiplicand and the CSAPL multiplicand respectively. On 2 May 2019, Mr Yeo reminded Mr Stollberg of the formula mentioned by Mr Fewkes in the 17 April 2018 E-mail and thus suggested that a multiplicand of 280% be used. Mr Stollberg’s reply on 3 May 2019 was that the CSAPL board can only approve the STI “related to the CSAPL contract with the SVP”.

</div> As such, the rationale behind the board’s decision not to award the CIPL STI on 6 May 2019 (see [27] above) as shown by the contemporaneous objective evidence is that CSAPL did not consider it liable to pay the CIPL STI<span class="font-italic"> </span>at all (and nothing was said about the basis of the calculation). Accordingly, I allow Mr Jagetia’s counterclaim for the CIPL STI for the sum of S$114,800.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to an annual increment </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Given the dearth of local authorities on claims in employment law for increments, I turn to consider the English authorities which Mr Jagetia relies on and CSAPL does not refute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In <span class="font-italic">Clark v BET </span><span class="font-italic">plc and another</span> [1997] IRLR 348 (at 349), the employment contract provided that the employee’s salary “shall be reviewed annually and be increased by such amount if any as the board shall in its absolute discretion decide”. Such a clause was held to mean that there is “an obligation to review the salary every year”. Furthermore, despite the purported “absolute discretion”, “if the board had capriciously or in bad faith exercised its discretion so as to determine the increase at nil and therefore to pay [the employee] no increase at all, that would have been a breach of contract”. As such, the court went on to hold that the question to be answered on the facts is “what position [the employee] would have been in had [the employer] performed this obligation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In undertaking such inquiry, the increment offered to other employees in a similar position (if any) is a relevant consideration. In that regard, it was held in <span class="font-italic">Transco plc v O’Brien</span> [2002] ICR 721 (“<span class="font-italic">Transco</span>”) that to “single out an employee on capricious grounds and refuse to offer him the same terms as were offered to the rest of the workforce is … a breach of the implied term of trust and confidence”. This is because a “capricious refusal … to offer the same terms to a single employee” is likely to cause serious damage to the relationship of trust between an employer and employee (at [17]). I caveat, however, that <span class="font-italic">Transco </span>concerned a large workforce consisting of 75 workers whereas the present case concerns mainly two other persons – the CIPL MD and GBPL MD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 What is clear from the foregoing cases is that an employee has no automatic right to an increment. Rather, the rights and obligations of parties concerning increments ultimately depend on the employment contract in question. As such, whether an employee is <span class="font-italic">contractually entitled </span>to an increment depends on a proper interpretation the clauses in the employment contract between the parties, bearing in mind the <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>principles. Where an employment contract provides for a discretionary increment, such discretion must be exercised in <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> rationally, and not arbitrarily or capriciously. These principles are consistent with the English cases above and draw upon the principles relating to bonuses (as mentioned at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I should add that by <span class="font-italic">Transco, </span>the proposition relating to the fetters on discretion in relation to awarding increments appears to hinge on the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment context. I am mindful that the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dong Wei</span> (at [70]–[93]), when discussing the issue of limits to the contractual right to terminate without cause, casted some doubt on the existence of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment context (albeit only as <span class="font-italic">obiter</span><span class="font-italic"> dictum</span>). However, at [91], the Appellate Division of the High Court also acknowledged that in relation to “contractual discretions” which relate to rights subsisting within the contracts (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>discretionary bonuses<span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Leiman</span>), there may be “restrictions … to ensure that a party’s contractual discretion [is] not exercised in a manner which deprived its counterparty of its contractual rights, or which warped their contractual bargain”. Thus, I proceed on the position set out at [126] above.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 It is common ground that cl 6.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract provides that the Gross Annual Base Salary and the STI are to be “reviewed once a year” for which the first review shall be held in April 2019 (see [14] above).

The express wording of cl 6.2 clearly defines that the review and any revision is in respect of the “Gross Base Salary” and “STI” only. In that regard, even if (as I found) Mr Jagetia’s compensation package is to be considered as a whole (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Gross Annual Base Salary, STI and Annual Benefits Package), this does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the obligation to review the compensation under cl 6.2 extends to reviewing the Annual Benefits Package as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In respect of the Gross Annual Base Salary, I find that Mr Jagetia has not proved on a balance of probabilities that a 4% increment would restore him to the position he would be in had CSAPL reviewed his Gross Annual Base Salary. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Transco</span>, which involved some 75 employees, the present case involves the potential increment of only a handful of employees at some of the highest levels of management. Thus, quite apart from the case in <span class="font-italic">Transco</span>, I am not satisfied that Mr Jagetia was capriciously singled out by CSAPL such that only he was not entitled to an increment. Upon a review of Mr Jagetia’s Gross Annual Base Salary, CSAPL could have reasonably awarded him an increment of less than 4% or none at all, without capriciously singling him out.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 On the contrary, even on Mr Jagetia’s own evidence, it is evident that other employees in CIPL holding senior management positions such as the Vice President of Corporate Affairs, Director of Business Development and Director of Legal were not offered any increment.

</div> The evidence thus does not go so far as to demonstrate that Mr Jagetia must be awarded an increment, failing which it may be said that he was singled out capriciously. In any case, it is unclear why any increment to which Mr Jagetia is entitled must be the average of the increments offered to the CIPL and GBPL MDs without more. Indeed, Mr Jagetia’s own inconsistent case on the increment he would have been offered following a review (about 5% in his pleaded case and 4% in his closing submissions) suggests the uncertainty of the damage he suffered as a result of the breach of cl 6.2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Accordingly, I dismiss Mr Jagetia’s pleaded claim for a 5% increment and reject his argument for a 4% increment of the Annual Benefits Package and the Gross Annual Salary.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mr Jagetia is entitled to salary in lieu of notice</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ positions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 CSAPL’s position is that it was entitled to terminate Mr Jagetia’s employment under cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract.

</div> CSAPL argues that given the phrasing of cl 11.5 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “[i]n case of breach of this contract”), “<span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">any breach</span> of the [CSAPL SVP Contract]” [emphasis in original] is “sufficient to entitle [CSAPL] to exercise its right of termination”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 According to CSAPL, Mr Jagetia’s “various breaches” which entitled it to terminate the CSAPL SVP Contract are as follows: (a) breach of the Relocation Obligation; (b) breach of cl 2.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract by refusing to report to CSAPL’s board on all matters concerning the Rabobank Loan Facility, including lying about the same as Mr Stollberg alleges; (c) breach of cl 2.2 of the CSAPL SVP Contract by blatantly disregarding the board’s instructions; and (d) breach of cl 5.1 by spending more than some of his working time to further the interest of CSAPLH, based on his work calendar.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The crux of the issue is thus whether CSAPL is entitled to rely on cl 11.5 to terminate Mr Jagetia for breach of the CSAPL SVP Contract. The factual circumstances surrounding Mr Jagetia’s termination have been set out earlier and will not be repeated here. However, it is worth mentioning at the outset that Mr Jagetia’s position that he was being punished for the Collateral Purposes is not determinative of the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I am wholly unconvinced by CSAPL’s submission that cl 11.5 of the CSAPL SVP Contract entitles it to terminate the same on any breach. While the phrase “including gross non-fulfilment of duties” may suggest that it is “<span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not limited to</span> gross non-fulfilment of duties” [emphasis in original] as CSAPL contends, such a phrase clearly does not go so far as to suggest that any breach would entitle CSAPL to terminate the CSAPL SVP Contract under cl 11.5. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 On the contrary, it is trite that not every breach of contract entitles the innocent party to terminate the contract. Even where a term in the contract expressly provides that “any breach” would entitle a party to terminate the contract at hand, such a phrase has been interpreted to mean “any repudiatory breach” where the contract concerns a “myriad of obligations of differing importance and varying frequency” (<span class="font-italic">Rice v Great Yarmouth Borough Council</span> [2000] All ER (D) 902 at [18] and [24]; <span class="font-italic">Dominion Corporate Trustees Ltd and others v Debenhams Properties Ltd</span> [2010] EWHC 1193 at [25] and [32]). This is because to read “any breach” literally flies in the face of commercial and business common sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out four situations which would amount to a repudiatory breach:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Situation 1: where the contract clearly and unambiguously states that in the event of a certain event or events occurring, the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the contract (at [91]);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Situation 2: where a party, by his words or conduct, simply renounces his contract inasmuch as he clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that he will not perform his contractual obligations at all (at [93]);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Situation 3(a): the condition/warranty approach where the focus is on the nature of the term breached and, in particular, whether the intention of the parties to the contract was to designate that term as one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract (at [97]); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Situation 3(b): where the focus is on the nature and consequences of the breach, in particular, where the breach in question will give rise to an event which will deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract (at [99]).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Turning to the four alleged breaches now relied on by CSAPL, I agree with Mr Jagetia’s position that only the justification put forth by CSAPL at the material time would be relevant to the inquiry of whether CSAPL was entitled to so terminate him under cl 11.5. Lying and subordination were not among the reasons that the CSAPL board had actually put forth at the board meeting on 26 June 2019 (see [30] above). It would be incorrect to consider these belated grounds that surfaced after the CSAPL board had already come to its decision, because they could not possibly have been part of the actual reasons for which CSAPL terminated Mr Jagetia’s employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I turn to the four grounds which were raised in the board meeting on 26 June 2019, upon which the CSAPL board resolved to terminate Mr Jagetia’s employment as SVP (see [30] above). In this regard, I have already found that there is no Relocation Obligation under the CSAPL SVP Contract and that the purpose of the Annual Benefits Package is not remuneration for the fulfilment of any Relocation Obligation. This deals with two of the grounds. I turn now to deal with the two remaining grounds (which are also allegations CSAPL now relies on). First, that Mr Jagetia breached cl 2.2 by refusing to answer the CSAPL board. Second, that Mr Jagetia failed to devote most of his working capacity to CSAPL in breach of cl 5.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In my judgment, the incidents which the CSAPL board relies on (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the discussion over the Rabobank Loan Facility at the board meeting on 7 February 2019 and, allegedly, correspondence over e-mail) do not amount to repudiatory breach within Situations 1–3(b) of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>. In that regard, cl 2.2 provides that Mr Jagetia “will report to the <span class="font-weight-bold">Board of CSAPL </span>with<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>daily oversight <span class="font-weight-bold">by Executive Vice President, Asia</span>” [emphasis in original] (see [10] above). On the evidence before me, it is not the case that Mr Jagetia failed to report to the CSAPL board. Indeed, the minutes of the board meeting on 7 February 2019 state:

Mr Pawan Jagetia said that he would not answer any more questions from the board members, before he had legal advice if he had to answer questions from the Board of every detail on his daily work. Mr Troels Libak Stollberg pointed out that he was not asking for details on the daily work but very specific on which banks Mr Pawan Jagetia has been in contact with regarding the refinancing which material has been shared with these banks. Mr Pawan Jagetia replied that he has already shared with the Board, why RABOBANK was the most attractive bank to consider.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Troels Libak Stollberg asked Mr Pawan Jagetia what the urgency is to push for the loan refinancing. Mr Pawan Jagetia commented that we are incurring 100,000 USD extra interest per week under the CBAS loan facility as compared to the more attractive rate from RABOBANK. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Peter Steenberg could not give Mr Pawan Jagetia mandate to continue negotiation with RABOBANK before certain material was presented, discussed and agreed to in the Board. This included the comparison between the current facility and the one currently being proposed by RABOBANK in their draft term sheet … Mr Pawan Jagetia agreed to prepare this material with the help from the external counsel …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In conclusion … it was agreed that Mr Pawan Jagetia together with the legal counsel should work on the internal lines preparing the legal and financial material for the Board for the next meeting… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 From the foregoing, it is plain that Mr Jagetia did not fail to report to the board but rather insisted that he had “already shared with” the board about the Rabobank Loan Facility. Also, Mr Jagetia continued to work with the CSAPL board in respect of the Financing Efforts. After the meeting, Mr Jagetia followed up with external counsel and reported back to the board on the same.

</div>
</div> In that regard, Mr Jagetia’s response in the midst of the heated exchange, cannot be objectively construed to be a failure to report to the CSAPL board in the totality of the circumstances. As such, Mr Jagetia’s conduct does not fall within Situation 2, Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b) in the <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>framework. For completeness, Situation (1) plainly does not apply in the present case since the CSAPL SVP Contract does not clearly and unambiguously stipulate that the innocent party will be entitled to terminate the contract upon a certain event occurring.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 As regards the alleged breach of cl 5.1, the CSAPL board was of the view that he was “devoting most of his time to further the interests of CSAPLH” such as his involvement in a “potential investment” project as well as “being named as the representative of CSAPLH as the claimant in the ongoing SIAC arbitration commenced by CSAPLH against [CBAS]”.

</div> In my judgment, such an assessment is not borne out by the objective contemporary evidence before me. The CBAS nominated directors were aware of Mr Jagetia’s role in the potential investment project as early as September 2018, but did not raise an issue with the amount of time Mr Jagetia was spending on such project at that material time.

</div> Furthermore, by the time Mr Jagetia received feedback from the board on his SVP performance on 6 May 2019, the board would have been well aware of both the arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, the feedback did not mention that the board considered Mr Jagetia’s conduct to be in breach of cl 5.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Accordingly, CSAPL is not entitled to rely on cl 11.5 to terminate Mr Jagetia without notice. In this regard, Mr Stollberg agreed that if there were no grounds to terminate Mr Jagetia under cl 11.5, he should have been served with three months’ notice under cl 11.4.
