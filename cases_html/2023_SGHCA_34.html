Section 14(2) prohibits a resulting trust from arising upon the failure of the express trust. This is an important provision to which I will return later. There is, however, nothing in the statute which prohibits a constructive trust from arising by operation of law. A constructive trust (at least one arising in the manner I have stated) falls into none of the prohibitions: it is neither a trust for sale nor an acquisition by a person intending to hold it only as a nominee. The Act prohibits trusts created by a transfer of property with the consent of, or the intention to benefit, the beneficiary. <span class="font-italic">The constructive trust, on the other hand, is imposed by law when the transfer occurs against the wishes of the beneficiary, often fraudulently, and without exception, to his detriment</span><span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37      The Parliamentary Debates reveal that the creation of a constructive trust in favour of a foreign person was never an issue which concerned the legislators. That is perhaps understandable – I do not see how giving effect to a constructive trust, at least one arising in the manner I have described, can contravene the objectives of the Act. If the property is purchased by a Singapore citizen intending to hold it absolutely, then, at face value, there is no violation of the Act: even if his investment is speculative, this is not the type of speculation which the Act is aimed at. <span class="font-italic">If, however, it happens that he was a fiduciary for some foreign person and had misappropriated the foreign person’s moneys to acquire the property, then the declaration of a constructive trust in the foreign person’s </span><span class="font-italic">favour does not in any way contravene the intention of the Act. There was no intention on the part of the foreign person to speculate in Singapore property. It cannot even be said that he intended to acquire that property.</span> <span class="font-italic">The acquisition of the property on trust for him is against his wishes</span>, and, in my view, he is entitled to trace his moneys into the property or the proceeds of its sale. <span class="font-italic">In short, a constructive trust in moneys used to purchase residential property would survive the provisions of the Act.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 From the extract above, Yong CJ was specifically referring to constructive trusts “imposed by law when the transfer occurs against the wishes of the beneficiary”, where a foreign person’s money was misappropriated and used to acquire residential property. In such a case, the foreign person had <span class="font-italic">no intention </span>to acquire the residential property in question; as a corollary, the Singapore citizen had <span class="font-italic">no intention</span> to hold the residential property on trust for the foreign person: on its terms s 23 of the RPA would not apply. The constructive trust discussed in <span class="font-italic">Intra Group</span> was one imposed by law to protect an innocent party, it was not one involving a contravention of s 23(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) by the Singapore citizen (as trustee), or s 23(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by the foreign person (as beneficiary).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Common intention constructive trusts come within the ambit of s 23 of the RPA, for they arise from the “common intention” of the parties; if the intentional conduct of the parties is prohibited by s 23 of the RPA, there is no basis to exclude common intention constructive trusts from the scope of the section. As the Judge below correctly found, “it is impossible to recognise, as a class, common intention constructive trusts which arises from an express common intention without undermining the policy of the [RPA] and the purpose of the prohibitions in it”: Judgment at [46]. This must be correct because otherwise, a foreigner can skirt the prohibitions in s 3 and 23 of the RPA and acquire an interest in residential property by alleging a “common intention constructive trust” as opposed to an “express trust”.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mdm Chee also argued that the RPA should not apply to trusts in favour of foreign persons who eventually acquire Singapore citizenship. Section 2(1) of the RPA however defines “foreign person” as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any person who is not a citizen;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) any permanent resident</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… who … has not been granted approval under section 25.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Mdm Chee was not a citizen, she was a permanent resident, and she had not been granted approval under section 25 of the RPA. The fact that she had applied for citizenship did not take her out of the statutory definition of “foreign person”. A common intention constructive trust in favour of Mdm Chee, a foreign person, was void under the RPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The RPA bars foreign persons from purchasing or acquiring an interest in residential property except by way of a mortgage, charge or reconveyance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Further, s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RPA prohibits foreign persons from purchasing or acquiring an interest in residential property except by way of a mortgage, charge or reconveyance (and Mdm Chee’s claim did not involve any of those modes).

She amended her Statement of Claim to allege for the first time that her lawyer had advised her that she could obtain 50% beneficial interest in the Sunrise Drive property notwithstanding that the purchase would be made by Mr Fan. The court noted when giving its decision on the striking out application on 10 February 2020 that it “certainly appears that [the appellant] is changing her case now that it has come to light that she was not a Singapore citizen at the time the [Sunrise Drive property] was purchased” and that her alleged discussions with Mr Fan appeared to be “an afterthought, in a bid to avoid a striking out of the claim”.
