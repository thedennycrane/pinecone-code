In the SMC complaints, she alleged that she suffered from many side effects after taking medication that Dr Chan had given her, and that she was addicted to the medication. She claimed that her relationship with Dr Chan had become more intimate as a result, and that Dr Chan had taken advantage of her knowing that she was emotionally unstable and under the influence of the medication. The SMC complaints also contained the offending words as reproduced at [8] above. Further, the respondent claimed in the SMC complaints that Dr Chan wrote her an apology letter (presumably the one referred to at [7] above) and offered her a compensation sum of $10,000 to settle the matter, but that she had declined the offer.

The appellant had admitted during cross-examination that he had suggested having a foursome with Dr Chan involving the respondent.

The appellant had also adduced evidence to show that the respondent had contacted his wife on 24 April 2018 regarding his sexual exploits while the respondent was still vacationing abroad with Dr Chan.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The law in this area is well-settled. The court is to decide what meaning the words complained of would have conveyed to an ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense (<span class="font-italic">Microsoft Corp v SM Summit Holdings Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and other appeals </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 465 at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To succeed in the defence of justification, the sting of the charge has to be proven. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 506 at [44]:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">The defendant has only to prove the “sting” of the charge, and some leeway for exaggeration and error is given. As stated by Burrough J in Edwards v Bell (1824) 1 Bing 403 at 409:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be justified; it is unnecessary to repeat every word which might have been the subject of the original comment. As much must be justified as meets the sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not add to the sting of it, that need not be justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 While the court need not “engage in a meticulous examination of every word in question or every detail of fact” (<span class="font-italic">Oei</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David and others </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 277 at [94]), the defence of justification would not be made out if a defendant’s attempt to show that the defamatory statements are true rested “largely on unsubstantiated assertions of fact, tenuous circumstantial evidence and inferences” (see <span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran v Chew Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Victor </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 at [37]). The justification must “meet the sting of the charge” (<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004 at [127]). </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">33 For the respondent to succeed in her defence of justification, she must show that the allegations contained in the offending words were substantially true. The DJ was entitled to summarise the offending words to capture the sting or the gravamen therein. I do not view her summary as a material departure from the version pleaded by the appellant.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">34 With reference to whether the offending words were justified, the court must examine whether the evidence showed that (i) the appellant and Dr Chan were colluding to take advantage of (ii) other “vulnerable woman patients”, (iii) sourcing and grooming these “patients turned victims”, and (iv) exchanging information of patients and colleagues whom they had deemed could be easily taken advantage of. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">35 The main allegation is that of “colluding … to take advantage of” “vulnerable woman patients”. This would include taking preparatory steps to do so, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the respondent need only show that the appellant and Dr Chan had colluded to <span class="font-italic">attempt</span> to take advantage of such patients. The offending words referred to “other vulnerable woman <span class="font-italic">patients</span>” (emphasis added) and referred to “patients” in the plural form in all three statements. As such, the respondent would need to show that there were multiple female patients (or potential “victims”) who were targeted by the appellant and Dr Chan. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">36 “Colluding” in its ordinary meaning refers to deliberately conspiring, cooperating or working together in secret, usually for deception and/or to secure unlawful gain or improper advantage. I do not accept that there was evidence of any collusion to take advantage of colleagues and I shall explain my reasons for taking this view in due course.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">37 To “take advantage” of female patients in the sense that the respondent had alleged does not simply mean “looking for women to have sex”. The respondent clearly linked this to exploitative and predatory behaviour involving “vulnerable woman patients”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, patients who were known to the appellant and Dr Chan and who might have been deemed to be more susceptible to becoming their sex targets, such as through manipulation or grooming. Consent to sexual activity as such is not a material consideration if they had been targeted to be taken advantage of in this manner.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">38 On the subject of “taking advantage” of female patients, it cannot be reasonably disputed that as doctors and professional men, the appellant and Dr Chan should not be having sexual relations with their patients, or facilitating each other in their efforts to bed women who are their patients or subordinate colleagues, such as nurses or junior doctors. It is both ethically and morally objectionable to do so, leaving aside for the moment the question of whether any of the females was in a vulnerable position such that they could be easily taken advantage of.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">39 Doctors are in a position of trust in relation to <span class="font-italic">all </span>their patients. Whether a female patient is in a vulnerable position vis-à-vis her male doctor is fact-specific. Given the context in the present case, this involves inquiring into whether the appellant’s and Dr Chan’s female patients were identified through the doctors’ interactions with them as patients who could be their potential sex targets, or for the purpose of one doctor passing them to the other to have sex with. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">40 The sting in the offending words lies in the appellant and Dr Chan colluding by using their positions as medical professionals to take advantage of and/or to attempt to take advantage of “vulnerable woman patients”. The key issue is whether the respondent has proven the sting of this charge. In this regard, no other “woman patients” were named by the respondent apart from K and the respondent herself. I turn first to consider whether the appellant could be said to have colluded with Dr Chan to take advantage of the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Findings in relation to the respondent </span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">41 The appellant submitted that Dr Chan had only provided medication to the respondent after she had discovered the WhatsApp messages on his phone. The respondent was therefore not a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>patient at the point the messages were sent.

Although whether a particular patient is vulnerable remains a question of fact, presumptively every female patient of the appellant and Dr Chan could be deemed to be vulnerable if the appellant or Dr Chan should initiate steps which were clearly intended as a means to have sexual activities with the patient as the end goal. If it had been established that the respondent was Dr Chan’s patient and that she was reliant on him for medical advice or medication, she was <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> vulnerable and would have been deemed to be more susceptible to Dr Chan’s suggestions. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">46 With respect, I do not agree with the DJ’s findings in relation to the respondent. To begin with, it is not clear that there was any collusion to take advantage of the respondent. The context of the message about allegedly having a foursome involving the respondent was explained by the appellant and Dr Chan. The appellant did not dispute that the message he sent to Dr Chan which mentioned “meet[ing] one day with serene” was a reference to a foursome, but he maintained that it was made purely in jest. Dr Chan had a more literal understanding of the appellant’s message and he apparently did not see any connection to the appellant’s earlier message mentioning a foursome with one ‘E’. He thought that the appellant was asking him whether the respondent was “open-minded enough” to meet if he (the appellant) was with someone else other than his wife. Their explanations suggest that they could have been talking at cross-purposes and are not inherently unbelievable given the text and context of the messages. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">47 Fundamentally, the DJ had adopted the premise that the respondent was indeed Dr Chan’s <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> patient at the time, and thus saw the message taking on a different complexion. However, I do not see how the respondent can be considered to be one among the “vulnerable woman patients” since it was not established when she even became a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> patient of Dr Chan. The DJ found that the respondent was a <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>patient on the basis that Dr Chan had prescribed her Xanax, and that he had “exercised his professional medical judgment and adhered to treatment guidelines when he assessed the suitable dosage and the number of the tablets that she should take”.

The respondent “reportedly experienced adverse reactions from these medications such as increased anxiety, headaches and amnesia”.

Parties did not agree on the truth of the contents in the document, Dr Lee did not give evidence during the trial, and the respondent, who did not take the stand, also did not give evidence on what she had said to Dr Lee. In any event, the letter written by Dr Lee was vague, and did not state when the medications were allegedly prescribed to her by Dr Chan. The same concerns arose in relation to relying on the SMC complaints as evidence of the truth of their contents. The statement in the SMC complaints that the respondent had informed Dr Chan in November 2017 that she was suffering from symptoms as a result of consuming medication was never agreed to by both parties and was not put to Dr Chan in the course of trial proceedings. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">52 I agree with the appellant’s counsel that the SMC complaints and the Resilienz Clinic letters are not evidence of the truth of their contents. The Resilienz Clinic letters were based on self-reported statements, since Dr Lee would have prepared the letters solely on the basis of the respondent’s account of events. The SMC complaints similarly record the respondent’s version of events. Based on the Resilienz Clinic letter, the respondent’s diagnosis also took place only in July 2018. In any event, the respondent was not prepared to offer evidence or undergo cross-examination, or to call any witnesses in support of her defence. I am therefore of the view that the SMC complaints and the Resilienz Clinic letters do not aid the respondent in proving her claim that Dr Chan had supplied medication to her in 2017 or at any time before April 2018.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">53 Further, there is no evidence that the appellant had known that Dr Chan had supplied the respondent with Xanax.

</div> and there is no evidence to show that the appellant in fact had such knowledge. It could not be inferred that the appellant must have known that the respondent was Dr Chan’s patient. Thus, the allegation of “collusion” between the appellant and Dr Chan to take advantage of the respondent as a female patient is also not made out. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">54 Unlike all the other women who have been mentioned in the WhatsApp messages, the respondent was in a unique position. She was already in an existing intimate relationship with Dr Chan. On the available evidence, this relationship developed well before she became his <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> patient. Even assuming she was Dr Chan’s <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> patient all along since 2017, she had never at any time complained about being vulnerable or being taken advantage of by Dr Chan until her surreptitious discovery of his WhatsApp messages in April 2018. Moreover, Dr Chan did not divulge any confidential personal information pertaining to the respondent which he had obtained <span class="font-italic">qua</span> their doctor-patient relationship. These considerations greatly attenuated her argument that she was among the vulnerable “patients turned victims”. The respondent clearly considered herself to be one such victim, but apparently only when she realised that she was not Dr Chan’s exclusive lover as she thought she might have been. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">55 If there was any relationship of trust between Dr Chan and the respondent in the circumstances, it was not founded on the doctor-patient relationship but on their existing intimate relationship. This necessarily meant that any such relationship of trust would more likely than not have existed before the respondent could claim to be his patient. Dr Chan’s decision not to register the respondent as a patient is not the subject matter of this trial even if it could be considered to be an incontrovertible breach of professional ethics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any case, taking the respondent’s case at its highest, the appellant’s WhatsApp message was a suggestion about a possible foursome which might involve the respondent. This standalone message was still at least one step removed from a plan between the appellant and Dr Chan which could amount to collusion to take advantage of the respondent. The idea may have been conceived by the appellant but no further deliberation or preparatory step was taken beyond an isolated message where the appellant had bounced the idea off Dr Chan. Dr Chan may have said that he thought the respondent would be “ok with it” but no further discussions ensued and nothing else developed from this.

</div> </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">61 The respondent argued that the appellant had failed to respect doctor-patient confidentiality by releasing the contact details of K to Dr Chan. More importantly, he had done so in order to enable Dr Chan to meet K under the pretext of purchasing a property, and potentially engage in sexual activities with her. The explanation given by the appellant that the WhatsApp exchanges related to a property purchase must be rejected for the following reasons. First, sexual topics dominated the messages sent between the two men. Second, the text of the messages showed that Dr Chan and the appellant were discussing meeting up with K for sexual activities. Dr Chan’s reaction asking “Me? Out of the blue ask her?” suggests that he did not in fact have any plans to purchase a property, as it would not otherwise be “out of the blue” to ask her out for drinks. Similarly, his reaction that he “can’t decide to go thru the property route” showed that he did not have any intention of purchasing a property. Third, K was expecting Dr Chan to contact her regarding a property purchase only because the appellant had told K that Dr Chan would do so, as a pretext for Dr Chan to contact her to attempt to engage in sexual activities.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">63 Viewing the exchange of messages in context, I note that the appellant did not divulge any confidential personal information pertaining to K, such as details of her medical condition which he had obtained <span class="font-italic">qua</span> their doctor-patient relationship. It is fairly common knowledge that property agents advertise their services widely and their contact numbers are hardly sacrosanct or confidential information. Assuming that K is still a property agent, it would be reasonable to assume that a quick Internet search will probably enable anyone to locate her contact information.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">64 I accept the appellant’s submission that the DJ had wrongly linked together the contents of the two messages in ABD3 and ABD43. On the face of the messages, they appear to be exchanges about two very different fact situations concerning different individuals. The fact that the word “game” appears in both ABD3 and ABD43 is insufficient to enable any inference that the messages are related. As stated at [25] above, the chronological order and context of WhatsApp messages, which are often abbreviated, disjointed and sometimes ungrammatical, may not always be clear. However, even if that were the case, I am not persuaded by the appellant’s attempts to characterise the exchange in ABD3 as an entirely innocuous one. The “game” was allegedly about making offers for property, but this reference to the “game” was followed with purportedly joking lewd banter by the appellant about “dilatation of her anus after her wounds heal”. I do not accept that this was nothing more than a meaningless and distasteful attempt at levity. It is irrelevant whether Dr Chan responded to it; the fact that he apparently did not is neither here nor there. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">65 In my view, the more probable inference is that the appellant was sharing K’s contact details with Dr Chan so that he could meet her to play his “game” and try his luck at getting her to have sex with him. This finds support in Dr Chan’s reply that he could not decide to “go thru the property route”. The explanations given by the appellant and Dr Chan in fact contradict this reply as they strenuously tried to suggest that Dr Chan was genuinely interested in meeting K as a prospective property purchaser. However, if Dr Chan had no immediate interest in any properties K was marketing (as he claimed), he could easily have said so directly. He did not. Instead, he said that he could not <span class="font-italic">decide</span> (whether) to “go thru the property route”. This presupposes that there were <span class="font-italic">other</span> possible “routes” in their playbook. It could only mean that there was an existing understanding between them that meeting K via the “property route” was a convenient pretext to facilitate a possible sexual liaison. Tellingly, Dr Chan did not say that he had <span class="font-italic">decided not to take that route</span>. Dr Chan’s message expressing indecision suggests that he might have had second thoughts, or he might have been considering some other “route”. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">66 Notwithstanding that Dr Chan did not proceed to meet up with K, the DJ was not wrong in her finding. By Dr Chan showing ostensible interest in a possible property purchase, this was a mere pretext to meet K. Unlike the one-off message allegedly alluding to a foursome with the respondent, there had already been prior discussions about Dr Chan taking the “property route”, as shown clearly from the appellant’s remark that K was “expecting [Dr Chan to contact her] re the property”. The appellant had also told K that Dr Chan would contact her. It followed that the “game” they spoke so knowingly of was not being explored for the first time. It would have involved Dr Chan making a ‘low-ball’ offer for property, and the likely inference was that this “property route” was part of a strategy to meet and seduce more “sluts” (a term used in their text messages at ABD43 and ABD51

</div>) by first setting up the charade of Dr Chan being a genuine property purchaser who was prepared to make some offer as an expression of interest. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">67 Dr Chan took no further steps to try to meet K but this does not change the intent and complexion of the appellant’s seeded idea – which was for Dr Chan to use the “property route” as a means to an end. On top of seeding the idea, the appellant gave Dr Chan her contact information and seemingly egged him on to act on the idea. In short, K was being set up by the appellant for Dr Chan’s possible benefit.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">68 The appellant’s act of giving Dr Chan K’s contact for Dr Chan to try his luck through the “property route” was, in my view, correctly assessed by the DJ as being tantamount to colluding to take advantage of K. It did not matter that K consented to the appellant, her doctor, giving Dr Chan her contact information as she must have thought that this was intended for a completely different and legitimate purpose. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">69 In my assessment, it was undoubtedly unscrupulous and impermissible for the appellant to try to target K, his former patient, in this manner with full knowledge that she was a property agent who would be ready and willing to meet potential clients. I do not accept the appellant’s argument that K was not a “vulnerable woman patient” merely because the doctor-patient relationship between the appellant and K had ended, and I do not agree that K was not vulnerable vis-à-vis Dr Chan. Neither does it matter that Dr Chan did not eventually meet up with K. That said, the DJ’s holding at [21] of her GD (see [22] above), which leads to the conclusion that any patient would be vulnerable vis-à-vis her doctor, is perhaps an overstatement. Vulnerability is a fact-specific assessment and the facts and context in each case have to be examined to determine whether a particular patient was a “vulnerable woman patient” targeted by the appellant and/or Dr Chan. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">70 In these circumstances, K was vulnerable since the appellant had previously interacted with her and, knowing her vocation, must have assessed that she would be more susceptible to being set up for a meeting with Dr Chan. She would hence become easy prey for Dr Chan to work his charms on, through the “property route”. K was thus vulnerable vis-à-vis the appellant, and the appellant’s attempt to set up a meeting for her with Dr Chan was driven by an ulterior and insidious motive. The appellant, by passing K’s contact to Dr Chan and discussing means by which he could meet up with K for sexual activities, had colluded with Dr Chan in an attempt to take advantage of a female patient. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">71 The appellant’s argument that K was not a vulnerable patient because she was not vulnerable vis-à-vis Dr Chan cannot hold: the offending words state that Dr Chan and the appellant had <span class="font-italic">colluded</span> with each other to take advantage of patients and had exchanged the contact details of such patients. The patient in question would be vulnerable vis-à-vis her own doctor if the factual circumstances support such a finding, and the offending words made out because there was collusion between the two men to take advantage of the said patient. By the appellant’s logic, no patient that one doctor aided the other to meet with the aim of engaging in sexual activities would be deemed vulnerable. That K was no longer a patient of the appellant also did not assist him. The appellant had gotten to know K, obtained her contact details, and assessed her suitability as a target by virtue of his status as her doctor. He had also passed on K’s contact details to Dr Chan on the day that he discharged her, and he could not possibly argue that the nexus between his knowledge of K and the doctor-patient relationship had already been extinguished.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">72 Assuming that K had actually gone on to meet Dr Chan through the “property route” and eventually agreed to have sex with him, it would still mean that this must have arisen only because the appellant and Dr Chan had colluded for Dr Chan to take advantage of K. The appellant had suggested targeting K and had given Dr Chan her contact details, knowing that K would not be likely to refuse to meet Dr Chan. Meanwhile, K would have remained blissfully unaware that Dr Chan’s only objective was sex and not a property purchase. Given the context, K was vulnerable. She would have been deceived into meeting Dr Chan who was masquerading as a bona fide purchaser. Even if she had consented to have sex with Dr Chan, such consent would not make her any less vulnerable vis-à-vis the appellant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">73 Fortuitously for Dr Chan, for reasons best known to him, he apparently did not traverse the “property route” or any other route to meet K. It may well be that he simply ran out of time to act on the idea after the respondent had accessed his handphone and seen the various WhatsApp messages. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">74 I agree with the DJ that there was justification in the instance where K was targeted. There was evidence that the appellant and Dr Chan had colluded to try to take advantage of her. In terms of the respondent’s defence, I view this as partial justification at best given that the offending words refer to “other vulnerable woman patients” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the plural form). The sting of the offending words is primarily that the appellant and Dr Chan had abused their positions of trust to take advantage of vulnerable female <span class="font-italic">patients</span>, and the nature and extent of the allegations made against the appellant and Dr Chan would no longer be <span class="font-italic">substantially true</span> if the evidence shows that only <span class="font-italic">one</span> such patient had been targeted. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">75 The respondent submitted that if she could show that the offending words were justified in respect of K, it would be enough for her to succeed in her defence of justification. This is because the passing of a patient’s information to a third party for the purposes of engaging in sexual activities is the “most serious” of the offending words.

There must be evidence of more than one patient who had been targeted, as K’s case may have been purely a one-off instance of a patient who became a possible sex target. It is not open to the court to speculate that because one patient had been targeted, there must have been others in the past or that there will be others in the future. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">77 Leaving aside discussion of K and the respondent for the moment, the undisputed evidence before the court is that whatever sexual shenanigans the appellant and Dr Chan were involved in were all consensual. No evidence was adduced of any improper means used by the duo to obtain such consent. No minors were involved. Some of the messages hint at predatory behaviour. Lasciviousness and promiscuity may be morally questionable to some, but dubious morals are not sufficient per se to indicate that any of their other sex partners had been manipulated or deceived.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Messages relating to ‘colleagues’ </span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">78 For completeness, I should add that the DJ wrongly found support from irrelevant evidence relating to the appellant and Dr Chan’s conduct in relation to “colleagues”.

The DJ took into account the WhatsApp messages in relation to other women to support her finding that the appellant and Dr Chan had colluded to take advantage of the respondent and at least one other patient K (see [22] above). However, the only pattern these four examples reveal is that the appellant and Dr Chan were both consummate opportunists, constantly looking out for women with sex in mind. But these examples did not show any <span class="font-italic">collusion </span>between them to take advantage of vulnerable women or colleagues. It was also hardly clear that these were instances where information as to potential targets was “source(d)” or “exchanged”. At the most, the four instances at [24] of the GD were examples of the appellant and Dr Chan’s individual efforts to source for potential targets – not all of which succeeded. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">84 In summary, there is sufficient evidence of the appellant having capitalised on his trusted position as a doctor by targeting K as a possible object of Dr Chan’s sexual gratification. However, I am not persuaded that the same can be said in relation to the respondent. The respondent was already having an affair with Dr Chan. There is insufficient evidence to support her claim that she was his patient. The evidence in relation to the respondent disclosed no more than a single ad hoc reference within one WhatsApp message exchange. The respondent shot out her missives to the SMC and others on her own admitted ‘impressionistic view’, but her view was somewhat jaundiced and not wholly sustainable.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">85 As the respondent has not succeeded in her defence of justification, the appeal is allowed. The appellant shall have judgment for his claim in libel and damages are to be assessed by the District Court. I shall also grant the appellant an injunction restraining the respondent from publishing or causing to be published the offending words or other words similarly defamatory of him. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">86 Nevertheless, I am unable to say that the appellant has been fully vindicated. What the appellant and Dr Chan have done outside their professional roles with their various sex partners is entirely a matter of their own personal choice. But the appellant and Dr Chan do not have any reason to hold their heads high, for there is no moral victory that either they or the respondent can lay claim to. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">87 I recognise that the appellant’s hand was forced towards litigation but this may well prove to be a Pyrrhic victory for him. In seeking to protect his reputation, he has had to subject his private sexual life to the glare of full public scrutiny in the courtroom. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">88 No doubt the WhatsApp messages are private exchanges between old friends, but it is often only in private exchanges, where one’s guard is down, that true colours reveal themselves. Ostensibly for the sake of protecting his reputation, the appellant has been compelled to come clean on having repeatedly cheated on his spouse on multiple occasions. Dr Chan has admitted to touching his colleague (one Dr P) inappropriately in the past. The incident(s) involving Dr P may be a matter for the SMC to consider looking into further, notwithstanding Dr Chan indicating (see [80] above) that he had apologised to one ‘S’ (who, in the context of the messages, is presumably Dr P). </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">89 The appellant and Dr Chan’s smug boasts of their trysts with various women, as well as the demeaning terms in which they gloatingly describe their sexual conquests, speak to their true character. They may be perfectly competent doctors and their sex lives are of course private matters. But their blatant treatment of women as sex objects sullies whatever professional reputation they might have built up for themselves. On the evidence before me, the appellant and Dr Chan have not harmed any patients directly by their conduct. There was however potential harm to K and thus the respondent was justified in her statements where K was concerned. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">90 I shall hear the parties’ submissions on the costs of this appeal and of the proceedings below. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Philip Jeyaretnam SC, Christopher Chong Fook Choy, Aw Sze Min and Mark Lewis Shan (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Ying Ping and Chua Kok Siong, Kenneth (Ong Ying Ping Esq) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
