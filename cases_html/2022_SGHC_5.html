Yong’s credit could potentially have been undermined if he had been confronted with these inconsistencies, especially since they concerned details regarding his allegation that he passed bribe monies to the appellant – an allegation which founded the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of the charges against the appellant, and which the appellant firmly denied. Yong’s credit was significant to the outcome of this case given that Yong was the only witness capable of giving direct evidence of the bribes that were allegedly obtained by the appellant.

</div> but Ong did not have personal knowledge of whether Yong did in fact give the appellant monies. Whether this was done resided exclusively within the knowledge of Yong and the appellant. Since Yong claimed that he personally passed the gratification to the appellant in cash, there was also no documentary evidence corroborating this. As a result, much of the case against the appellant hinged on Yong’s credit and credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 That said, the S$99,008 Lie would potentially undermine Yong’s credit and credibility to a lesser extent than his inconsistencies regarding the Bribe Formula and the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed. It did not appear plausible that Yong had an ulterior motive for eventually coming clean about the $99,008 and exonerating the Applicant entirely on this score only very late in the course of investigations. Nevertheless, Yong was dishonest initially, and taken alongside the inconsistencies in the other two aspects, his initial lie could not be assumed to be of no import.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Unfortunately, while the Statements (except for the 3rd CPIB Statement) threw up these inconsistencies which could have potentially undermined Yong’s credit and credibility, they<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>were not disclosed to the appellant before or at the proceedings below, and the appellant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Yong on these points. Had the relevant Statements been available to the appellant at the proceedings below, the appellant would have been able to capitalise on these three inconsistencies to further discredit Yong under cross-examination or seek to impeach his credit, bearing in mind that the appellant’s case theory had always been that Yong was lying about paying bribes to the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Although the Statements were presumptively statutorily inadmissible (see s 259(1) of the CPC), the inconsistencies revealed by the Statements in question opened up additional lines of cross-examination which Yong could have been subjected to, and provided a real chance of leading to admissible oral evidence from Yong which would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be credible (since it would have been made under oath) and relevant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>having a bearing on the appellant’s guilt or innocence). Since Yong was the one who gave the Statements, he would be expected to be able to clarify whether the inconsistencies in respect of the Bribe Formula and the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed were a result of untruthfulness, or human fallibility in communication, retention and/or recollection. He was also in a position to explain his reason for coming clean about the S$99,008 only nearly ten months after investigations commenced. Yong’s responses upon being confronted with these inconsistencies could either undermine or reaffirm his credit and credibility as the key Prosecution witness. Put another way, his responses would <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>have a potential bearing on whether his evidence that he gave bribes to the appellant ought to be believed or rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Consequently, I found that the Statements (except for the 3rd CPIB Statement) should have been disclosed pursuant to the Prosecution’s <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Remedying the Kadar breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 A <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach does not automatically cause a conviction to be overturned: <span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 5 SLR 626 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang</span>”) at [21] citing <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [120] and <span class="font-italic">Mia </span><span class="font-italic">Mukles v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGHC 252<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]. Rather, the first step is to ascertain what the consequences of the <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>breach ought to be. For the purposes of this inquiry, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the effect of the breach on the evidence against the accused;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) how the breach prejudiced the accused;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether steps can be, or have been, taken to remedy the prejudice caused; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the causes of the breach, including the conduct of the Prosecution.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As rightly noted by Aedit Abdullah J, a balancing exercise weighing these specific factors as well as the broader objectives of the administration of justice has to be carried out: <span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span>at [22]. In this regard, an acquittal is only warranted where the <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach constitutes a material irregularity which occasions a failure of justice: <span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang</span> at [21]. After deciding the outcome that ought to have flowed from a <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> breach, the next question to consider is whether the court has the power to bring about that outcome: <span class="font-italic">Lim Hong Liang </span>at [24].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Here, an outright acquittal was inappropriate as the Statements (except for the 3rd CPIB Statement) did not clearly indicate that the conviction must be unsafe. A witness’s credit and credibility must be closely scrutinised in the light of all the evidence before the court, including the witness’ explanation (or lack thereof) for the discrepancies: <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon </span><span class="font-italic">Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211 (“<span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon </span><span class="font-italic">Keong Peter</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]; <span class="font-italic">Loganatha</span> <span class="font-italic">Venkatesan and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Loganatha</span>”) at [56]. Without giving Yong an opportunity to explain the aforementioned inconsistencies, it could not be safely said that these inconsistencies strongly pointed towards an acquittal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my judgment, the appropriate course of action was to allow counsel for the appellant to further cross-examine Yong on the three defined areas of inconsistencies highlighted above at [18]. Putting Yong through further cross-examination on these three areas would adequately rectify the key prejudice caused to the appellant, that is, the deprivation of an opportunity to confront Yong with these three points of inconsistencies and fully test his credit and credibility. Since the <span class="font-italic">raison </span><span class="font-italic">d’être</span> of taking further evidence was to hear whether Yong would have any reasonable explanation to offer for these inconsistencies, a retrial <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> was not called for.

</div> this was merely a minor inconsistency which barely undermines Yong’s allegation that he had passed bribe monies to the appellant. It is insufficient to cast a doubt on Yong’s central position throughout the Statements and oral testimony, which was that there was some arrangement, be it spoken or unspoken, between Yong and the appellant that Yong could keep some of the “marketing expenses”. Yong’s evidence of such an arrangement presupposes the existence of a corrupt arrangement between the appellant, and therefore points towards a finding that Yong did in fact pass some of the “marketing expenses” to the appellant as bribes, but this still had to be considered alongside whether Yong was able to account for his various inconsistent positions on the Bribe Formula, the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed, and the S$99,008 Lie. As mentioned at [27] above, these inconsistencies could potentially lead to lines of inquiry which reveal that Yong did not in fact bribe the appellant.

</div>
</div> These sentences, read on their own, appear to support the interpretation advocated by the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, such an interpretation ignores the context in which the 3rd CPIB Statement was recorded. The 3rd CPIB Statement was a continuation of Yong’s 1st CPIB Statement and 2nd CPIB Statement. In these two earlier statements, Yong described the corrupt transactions he had with the appellant and consistently took the position that he pocketed some of the “marketing expenses” set aside by MCT. The focus of the 3rd CPIB Statement was thus to identify the MCT invoices which correspond to each corrupt transaction described in his earlier two statements.

</div>
</div>
</div> This was the issue which Yong directed his mind to when making the 3rd CPIB Statement; he did not intend to put on record a different position regarding the amount he actually gave the appellant. This is buttressed by the fact that before the 3rd CPIB Statement was recorded, Yong read his 1st CPIB Statement and 2nd CPIB Statement and told the CPIB that he had no amendments to make.

</div> In other words, at the time the 3rd CPIB Statement was recorded, he stood by his position that he pocketed a portion of the “marketing expenses”. In any case, Yong’s position at the appellant’s trial remained fully consistent with his admission that he did pocket some of the “marketing expenses”. Properly understood in its context, while the language in the 3rd CPIB Statement had been imprecise, it could not be said to reflect Yong’s position that he had passed the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> “marketing expense” to the appellant for each transaction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This conclusion is reinforced by Yong’s oral testimony at the Further Hearing.

</div> More fundamentally, this is not a material inconsistency. The appellant’s awareness as to how much bribe monies he would be receiving for each transaction is not sufficiently probative of whether the appellant did in fact receive bribes from Yong as stated in the charge, or whether the appellant knew that the alleged gratification was a reward for agreeing to transact at a price above the lowest price possible, these being the two main issues for this court’s determination given the way the appellant’s case was framed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the foregoing reasons, the analysis will proceed on the basis that Yong only gave two inconsistent accounts on the Bribe Formula.

Yong’s testimony at the Further Hearing demonstrates that he did not have any sinister, ulterior motive for admitting that he took the entire sum of S$99,008. Admittedly, Yong did not come clean solely because he was remorseful – he was motivated in part by the belief that the CPIB would soon discover that he kept the entire sum of S$99,008 for himself. Even then, this was merely a pragmatic consideration which factored into Yong’s decision to come forward with the truth. It is wholly insufficient to render Yong an untrustworthy witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As regards the inconsistencies in respect of the Bribe Formula and the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed, they arise out of Yong’s earlier statements on the one hand (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1st and 2nd CPIB Statements), and Yong’s later statements and oral testimony on the other.

</div> and effectively disavowed what he said in the earlier statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Objectively assessed, it is likely that Yong was confused when he gave evidence on the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed in his earlier statements. The 1st CPIB Statement was recorded approximately three years since the bribes were paid. It is thus entirely plausible that Yong made a genuine mistake in his earlier statements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1st CPIB Statement and the 2nd CPIB Statement), and only realised this in his 4th CPIB Statement when he was presented with a comparison between the aggregate sums he allegedly gave the appellant and the amount he allegedly pocketed for himself, as derived from his previous statements (see above at [64]). On the other hand, given that Yong readily acknowledged that the figures in the earlier statements were inaccurate without being confronted with any evidence to the contrary by SSI Xie, it is rather inconceivable that Yong had fabricated the numbers in his earlier statements and was tailoring his evidence as the investigations progressed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The appellant’s submissions were based largely on how Yong could not come up with sensible explanations when confronted with the inconsistencies regarding the Bribe Amounts Paid and Pocketed.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This ignores the fact that Yong repeatedly stated that he “cannot remember” why there were conflicting versions in his evidence. In other words, he had trouble coming up with an explanation why there were inconsistencies because he was unable to recall what went through his mind many years ago. The 1st CPIB Statement was given approximately three years after the bribe in the 8th Charge was paid. Nearly eight years after his statements were recorded and three years after he testified before the DJ in 2018, Yong was recalled as a witness at the Further Hearing. He did not have the opportunity to refresh his memory as to what he said at trial or to the CPIB. Understandably, he would face considerable difficulty explaining why there were inconsistencies in his evidence along the way. Yong did not appear to me to be an evasive witness. If at all, he was somewhat inarticulate but this, along with his inability to recollect why he took certain positions back when he gave the statements, should not be held against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The inconsistency as regards the Bribe Formula was also due to Yong’s poor articulation when the 1st CPIB Statement was recorded. As Yong explained, what he really meant by the phrase, “based on” a 3% figure, was that the 3% figure was used as a broad guideline. Even though Yong used the 3% figure in other parts of the 1st CPIB Statement to explain the actual bribe payments made to the appellant (see above at [69]), his evidence had always been that the 3% figure was merely a guideline and he did not stick closely to any method of calculation because his priority was to make a profit for MCT. This was the consistent position he took at the proceedings below as well as at the Further Hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In this connection, I address for completeness the appellant’s argument that Yong’s concept of the 3% figure being an initial guideline that was subject to subsequent negotiations was a dishonest afterthought. According to the appellant, this contradicted several paragraphs (such as paragraph 25) in the 1st CPIB Statement, which suggested that the 3% figure was a settled, post-negotiation figure.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-8c6a884c-2266-45fe-b001-c05ed358370c" data-toggle="modal" type="button">98</button></sup>

</div> However, in my view, it is not entirely clear on the face of those paragraphs whether this was what Yong really meant. In addition, at another segment of Yong’s 1st CPIB Statement, Yong claimed that “[t]he bribes for [the appellant] are calculated base[d] on 3% (per joint) of the <span class="font-italic">quotation price</span> sent to them” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> This indicated that the 3% figure was indeed used as a guide to kick start negotiations. In these circumstances, I am unable to accept the appellant’s contention that Yong’s concept of the 3% figure being an initial guideline was a dishonest claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Arguably, even if Yong had conceded that he must have lied in his earlier statements, this did not inexorably mean that the entirety of his subsequent evidence was lacking in credibility. This applies with equal force to the S$99,008 Lie Yong told in his first few statements. A trier of fact must give careful consideration to the witness’ lies as well as to his or her explanation (or lack thereof) for those lies in determining his creditworthiness (<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span><span class="font-italic"> Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 67<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [273]), and it bears reiterating that the assessment of a witness’s creditworthiness calls for a holistic appreciation of the material put before the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this connection, the veracity of Yong’s evidence and his creditworthiness were reinforced by the fact that shifts in his evidence only served to further incriminate himself while exculpating the appellant. Through the changes in the quantum of bribes for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 8th Charges, as well as the fact that Yong came clean about the S$99,008 Lie, Yong admitted to taking a total of S$124,008 more for himself than he initially acknowledged. The amount the appellant would have been liable for was correspondingly reduced. This fortifies the reliability of Yong’s evidence because as a matter of logic, a statement that is made against the interests of its maker is inherently more reliable: <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447 at [102].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Whether Yong had any reason to falsely implicate the appellant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Crucially, it has also not been shown that Yong had a motive to lie and falsely implicate the appellant. It is for the Defence to first establish sufficient evidence of a motive to make a false allegation (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [102]). Only where the Defence adduces sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case, would the Prosecution have to prove that there was no such motive (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr </span>[2019] 3 SLR 749 at [48], following <span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 374 at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the present case, the appellant has not discharged his burden. The appellant’s case theory was that Yong had pocketed all the “marketing expenses” for himself. In order to minimise his own liability, Yong falsely claimed that some of the “marketing expenses” was paid to the appellant as bribes. He had to admit to taking some of the bribe monies because he could not avoid the fact that he had made big-ticket purchases which left a paper trail. For the same reason, Yong’s evidence on the amounts he gave the appellant kept fluctuating because he wanted to see what he could get away with.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Quite apart from the fact that the shifts in Yong’s evidence further incriminated himself and correspondingly reduced the appellant’s criminal liability, the appellant’s case theory is speculative. It is unsupported by evidence even after the Further Hearing and remains implausible. Yong had nothing to gain since he had already pleaded guilty and had been duly sentenced even before the appellant was charged (see [4]–[5] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There is simply no evidence that Yong had in fact taken all the bribe monies for himself and wanted to falsely implicate the appellant to reduce his culpability. Neither is there evidence that Yong was crafting his evidence on the amount he pocketed based on the paper trail for his big-ticket purchases. There is no indication that Yong shifted his position on the amount of bribes he pocketed upon being confronted with his big-ticket purchases. Rather, as reflected in the 4th CPIB Statement which was adduced at the Further Hearing, the recording officer merely asked Yong to confirm the accuracy of the earlier figures he gave, and Yong, <span class="font-italic">on his own initiative</span>, corrected the amounts and further incriminated himself in the process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Counsel for the appellant submits that Yong admitted that his evidence as to how much he pocketed was strongly influenced by what he felt could be traced back to him.

</div> For this, reliance is placed on Yong’s acceptance of counsel’s suggestion at the Further Hearing that throughout the CPIB investigations, he realised that he could not explain his purchase of certain big-ticket items and had to decide how much to admit he had taken since there was a paper trail.

</div> I do not agree with counsel’s characterisation of Yong’s evidence. Yong was not saying that he tailored the quantum he pocketed according to the paper trail he left behind. Instead, he was saying that he had to ascertain how much he had taken, because the existence of the paper trail meant that he had to face up to the fact that he had taken some of the bribe monies. This understanding is buttressed by the fact that this suggestion by the appellant’s counsel was made on the back of several questions testing the veracity of Yong’s reasons for admitting that he took the full sum of S$99,008 for himself.

</div> In this context, Yong must have understood counsel for the appellant’s suggestion to mean that he had to admit to taking some of the bribe monies, and accordingly recall how much he had taken, because there was a paper trail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The most that can be said from this is that Yong was not completely altruistic when he chose to admit that he pocketed some of the bribe monies, in that he was motivated by the pragmatic consideration that there was evidence which showed that he must have taken some of the bribe monies. This, however, is wholly insufficient to impugn Yong’s credit or indicate that Yong harboured a motive to make false allegations against the appellant. A witness may believe that he has no choice but to admit to a wrongdoing, but this does not mean that the details of what he admitted to must necessarily be false, or that he must have been trying to absolve himself of liability by falsely implicating others. A witness who finds himself in such a situation may very well still do his best to recall and reveal the truth. This was the case on the instant facts. As argued by the Prosecution,

</div>
</div> Yong’s corrections to his evidence and his eventual testimony in court were not attempts to exaggerate the involvement of the appellant. They were the opposite. His willingness to take the initiative to correct his evidence when he noticed there were mistakes, and thereby further incriminate himself in the process, is not only uncharacteristic of someone trying to downplay his own criminal liability, but also serves to demonstrate that he was trying his best to put forward the true state of affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Notably, the appellant’s case theory intrinsically does not make much sense. The essence of the appellant’s case is that Yong was a self-serving witness who in fact dishonestly pocketed <span class="font-italic">all</span> the “marketing expenses” for himself but sought to minimise his own criminal liability by falsely claiming that he gave <span class="font-italic">some</span> of it to the appellant as bribes. It is hard to fathom why Yong would admit to giving bribes to the appellant and keeping some for himself for each transaction if he truly wanted to minimise his criminal liability. Such an admission would still cause Yong to incur criminal sanctions for corruption in respect of the amounts given to the appellant, <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> for criminal breach of trust in respect of the substantial amounts he dishonestly kept for himself. Yong was still exposing himself to prosecution for the full sum of the “marketing expenses” for each transaction. This would not be very far from the situation he would have been in if he had confessed to keeping all the “marketing expenses” for each transaction for himself. By implicating the appellant as the recipient of the bribes, this did not have the effect of minimising Yong’s own criminal liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Indeed, Yong was charged for both corruption and criminal breach of trust. When Yong pleaded guilty in 2015, the proceeded charges against him included one charge for conspiring with Ong to pay a bribe of S$78,806 to the appellant, another for conspiring with Ong to pay a bribe of S$99,008 to the appellant (which was eventually not paid), and an amalgamated charge of criminal breach of trust for keeping part of the “marketing expenses” for himself on five occasions in 2008. He also admitted and consented to have a further 31 charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These included nine counts of abetting the giving of corrupt gratification and two counts of criminal breach of trust: <span class="font-italic">Yong Hock Guan</span> at [1]–[3] and [13].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It bears emphasising that even before Yong pleaded guilty in 2015, he consistently maintained that he took a portion of the “marketing expenses” and gave the rest to the appellant as bribes. He was already prepared, right from the beginning, to expose himself to criminal liability for the full sum of “marketing expenses” for each deal, be it for dishonestly converting a portion for his own use or as a giver of a bribe. It is difficult to conceive how Yong’s admission was an attempt to minimise his criminal liability in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In these circumstances, there is no discernible reason for Yong to deviously drag the appellant down with false allegations of complicity as the recipient of the bribes. It is noteworthy that the appellant never advanced his case on the basis that Yong harboured any malice or ill-will towards him or was falsely implicating him in order to protect the true recipient of the bribes. Accordingly, there is no need for the Prosecution to prove the absence of a motive, since the appellant has not put forward a tenable basis on which such a motive can be shown or inferred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the appellant accept the gratification with guilty knowledge?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The second issue pertaining to the appellant’s conviction is whether the appellant accepted the gratification from Yong with guilty knowledge. The element of guilty knowledge requires the recipient of a bribe to know or realise that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. In particular, not only must there be a <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> between the gift received or promised and the dishonest benefit or gain conferred against the principal’s interests, the agent must perceive this to be so. The recipient must recognise that the gift is meant to act as an improper influence on his actions: <span class="font-italic">Leng </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Poh</span> at [21] and [26]. In view of the charges against the appellant, the appellant can be said to have the requisite guilty knowledge if he knows that the gratifications he received from Yong were rewards for him having agreed to purchase goods and services for Transocean from MCT at a price above the lowest possible price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I agree with the DJ’s finding that there was evidence showing that the appellant accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge (GD at [62]). The key piece of evidence which the DJ relied on in support of this finding was Yong’s testimony that it was the appellant who first hinted that he wanted something out of the business, out of each transaction. Indeed, Yong consistently maintained in his oral evidence that it was the appellant who had hinted that he wanted a bribe. Pertinently, Yong testified that the appellant suggested that some monies could be set aside on every quotation that resulted in a purchase contract.

</div> It must have been plain and obvious to the appellant that MCT was ready to accept a price that was lower than the stated purchase price for each transaction – the bribe scheme entailed the appellant taking a portion of the price paid by Transocean, and MCT obtaining an amount that was less than the price reflected on the purchase order. However, the appellant could not transact at the lowest possible price, otherwise there would be no room for his share of the deal. The appellant had structured the scheme such that he must agree to purchase, on behalf of Transocean, at prices higher than the lowest possible prices, so as to receive gratifications paid out of the stated purchase price. He cannot now disavow knowledge of this <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Against this, the appellant points to Yong’s oral testimony where he mentioned that the bribe scheme was subject to Ong’s approval, but he never told the appellant whether Ong gave his approval.

</div> This argument is unmeritorious. There is no need for the appellant to know of such details to possess the requisite guilty knowledge.

Yong and Ong, as givers of the bribe, were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for a charge corresponding to the 1st Charge faced by the appellant. Using this as a reference point, the DJ gave an uplift to eight months’ imprisonment for the appellant on the basis that the appellant’s culpability was higher than Yong’s. For this, the DJ relied on several factors, including the fact that the appellant had initiated the corrupt scheme and abused his position of trust (GD at [70]–[71] and [74]–[75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 After determining the individual sentences for each charge, the DJ found that the one-transaction rule should not be applied and ordered the individual sentences for three charges to run consecutively.

In particular, he found that the Defence’s assertion that the appellant suffered mental anguish, anxiety and distress due to the uncertainty of being subject to investigations and having his charges hanging over his head was not supported by any cogent evidence.

</div> According to the appellant, the DJ erred in three respects. First, the DJ erred in using the initial indicative sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the 1st Charge with reference to Yong’s and Ong’s individual sentences, and then calibrating the remaining sentences accordingly. Several reasons are given for this, including the fact that the appellant had a limited role to play in the scheme,

Although the general principle is that the giver and the recipient of gratification are equally culpable, many other factors must also be considered when deciding on the sentence to be imposed on the particular accused person who is before the court.

An important factor which the DJ had considered was that Ong and Yong had pleaded guilty whilst the appellant claimed trial. The fact that Yong pleaded guilty was expressly stated as one of the considerations weighing on the court’s mind when his individual sentences for the proceeded charges were determined: <span class="font-italic">Yong Hock Guan </span>at [11] and [13]. Although no written grounds were issued in respect of Ong’s sentence, it can reasonably be assumed that his plea of guilt must have been taken into account in the court’s determination of the sentence as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The appropriate sentence thus falls to be determined by reference to the factual matrix of the appellant’s case. In my view, the reasons relied upon by the DJ sufficiently justify the individual sentences imposed in respect of each charge. First, the appellant solicited the corrupt payments from Yong. This increases the appellant’s culpability as it reveals that the appellant was driven by greed and personal gain. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals </span>[2019] 5 SLR 926 had recognised that receiving parties who solicit gratification are more culpable (at [99(g)(iv)]).

At the time the offences were committed, the appellant was a manager of global strategic sourcing for the Asia Pacific region at Transocean.

</div>
</div> He was entrusted with the responsibility of negotiating prices with MCT, and the contracts he managed in this case ran into the millions. By arranging for bribe payments to be made out of the amounts Transocean paid to MCT, the appellant took advantage of the trust Transocean reposed in him and acted entirely against Transocean’s interests. Third, even though the quantum of bribes he accepted from Yong was less than the amount Yong and Ong had conspired to give him, he still accepted a substantial amount (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$270,000).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 When weighed against these considerations, the fact that the appellant was only a recipient of bribes and had a minimal role to play in the implementation of the scheme hardly made a dent in his culpability. The appellant’s argument that Transocean did not suffer any real detriment is also a non-starter. The very fact that the kickback was built into the purchase price meant that Transocean was paying more than was necessary for MCT’s goods and services. Therefore, I am not persuaded by the appellant’s arguments that the individual sentences ordered by the DJ are manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The DJ was also correct in holding that three individual sentences should be ordered to run consecutively. Quite apart from the fact that each corrupt payment accepted by the appellant related to a different commercial transaction, the one-transaction rule is ultimately an evaluative rule directed towards the enquiry as to whether an offender <span class="font-italic">should</span> be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time. In the present case, the multiplicity of offences over time and the substantial amount involved warrants the imposition of three consecutive sentences to reflect the severity of the crimes committed by the appellant. Having regard to the totality principle, the global sentence is not disproportionate or manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 On the issue of whether there has been inordinate delay, counsel for the appellant relies on the one and a half year delay from the time Yong was sentenced in November 2015 to the time the appellant was charged in May 2017, as opposed to the overall time taken since investigations commenced against the appellant in 2013. Indeed, time should only start running from November 2015, when Yong was sentenced. As a result of the appellant’s complete denial of the offences, the Prosecution, as a matter of strategy, is entitled to secure Yong’s conviction, including his sentence (since Yong’s plea of guilt could be qualified by his mitigation), before pressing charges against the appellant. The question which then arises is whether the one and a half years the Prosecution took to bring the present charges against the appellant since the time Yong was sentenced amounted to inordinate delay warranting a sentencing discount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The appellant places significant emphasis on the District Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Kee</span>, a prosecution linked to the present matter. However, the present case is distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Kee</span>. First, the court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Kee</span> at [68] found that there had been significant and unjustifiable delay in investigations and prosecution because the accused in that case faced four relatively straightforward charges. As there are twice the number of charges in the present case, the delay in charging the appellant following Yong’s conviction cannot be so readily characterised as inordinate. Second, the court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Kee</span> at [69] accepted that the delay had prejudiced the accused because the Prosecution in that case did not dispute that the accused was prejudiced in the manner highlighted by the Defence. When the accused in <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Kee</span> filed an appeal in respect of his sentence, the Prosecution again did not contest that the delay had prejudiced the accused. On the other hand, the Prosecution in the present case is disputing that the appellant had suffered actual prejudice. In particular, it submits that the appellant’s assertion that he suffered anguish or anxiety was a bare one.
