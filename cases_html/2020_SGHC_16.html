The purchase price was approximately $469m. After the sale, Daisho alleged that AST2 made a false and fraudulent misrepresentation of fact by giving advice that members of the public could access certain of the Hotel’s facilities even though the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) had stipulated that these facilities were not accessible to the public. Daisho took the dispute to arbitration (“the Arbitration”) and the tribunal (“Tribunal”) handed down an award ruling against Daisho (“the Award”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After its unsuccessful attempts to set aside the Award in the High Court and Court of Appeal, Daisho now seeks another bite of the cherry by suing the present defendant, Architects 61 Pte Ltd (“A61”), who was the project architect for the Hotel.

The misrepresentation was purportedly made by A61 to AST2 and then impliedly conveyed to Daisho. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In order to fully appreciate this case, I shall begin by tracing the background to the dispute and how the URA’s prohibition of public access to certain facilities of the Hotel came to be implemented. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Daisho is a company engaged in the acquisition and operation of assets such as hotels and restaurants.

</div> Daisho has not suggested that A61 had advised AST2 regarding how the Tour should be conducted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In other words, it follows from Mr Kohda’s evidence that A61’s purported Advice, even assuming that the Advice had been given to AST2, did not reach Daisho through the Draft Budget or the Tour. Thus, Daisho was unaware of the Advice and could not possibly have relied on the Advice purportedly given by A61 when it signed the SPA. Daisho’s evidence, on a balance of probabilities, fails to establish that A61 had directly or indirectly made any representation regarding the Advice to Daisho before it signed the SPA. Therefore, Daisho’s case against A61 is completely devoid of basic legal foundation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Even if Daisho did not know of the Use Restrictions before entering into the SPA (as it alleged), this lack of knowledge cannot be attributed to A61. A61 had advised AST2 to comply with the Use Restrictions imposed by the URA. This will become evident from my analysis below. It was not A61’s responsibility to bring the Use Restrictions to Daisho’s attention but that of Daisho’s advisers, who had been engaged to conduct a thorough due diligence check on the Hotel before Daisho signed the SPA. The purchase of the Hotel was conducted on the basis of <span class="font-italic">caveat emptor</span>. Daisho was fully aware of the implications and responsibilities of contract entered into on the basis of <span class="font-italic">caveat emptor</span> as it had engaged its own advisors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At this juncture, I shall briefly refer to a tangential issue in the Arbitration. In those proceedings Daisho alleged that representations were made by AST2 via the Tour and the Draft Budget that the public could access the Facilities. A61 relied on the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>or abuse of process to argue that Daisho could not raise this point in this Suit. A61 also referred to clause 23.2 of the SPA which provided: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Each party confirms that it has not entered into this Agreement … on the basis of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other statement whatsoever by another party or any of its Related Persons which is not expressly incorporated into this Agreement … </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It is unnecessary for me to resolve this issue because it would not have made a difference to my analysis, given my reasoning above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the basis of Mr Kohda’s evidence I dismiss Daisho’s case against A61.

</div> The Award states at paragraph 78[vii] that “the tenor of the advice from A61 was that operation of the hotel’s facilities by the operators of the hotel and not by outside businesses was consistent with the policy of the URA such that no problems would arise by receiving business from persons not resident in the hotel. This gave [AST2’s] representatives comfort that the restrictions would not pose a significant problem for the operation of the hotel.”. But this court is not bound to accept the findings the Tribunal made regarding A61, which was not even a party or a witness in the Arbitration. Since A61 was not given an opportunity to advance its case at the arbitral proceedings before the Tribunal made its findings, this court must be cautious of any of the Tribunal’s findings relating to A61. I shall now analyse the issue of whether A61 gave the purported Advice to AST2 based on documentary evidence, Mr Choy’s evidence, and A61’s witnesses’ evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Documentary evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Daisho admits that there was no documentary evidence to support the view that A61 had given the Advice. Thus, Daisho’s allegations are based entirely on oral evidence, primarily on Mr Choy’s oral evidence. A61 denies giving the Advice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the other hand, A61’s position is supported by the documentary evidence. All the documentary evidence shows that A61 informed AST2 to comply with the Use Restrictions and that A61 emphasised the importance of AST2 honouring its undertakings in the various LOUs. Moreover, the documentary evidence supports the view that AST2 did not advocate going, or intend to go behind the URA’s back by circumventing the Use Restrictions. When AST2 wished to designate certain ballrooms and meeting rooms as Hotel GFA yet allow the public to access these, there are records of A61 advising AST2 to appeal to the URA. As A61’s counsel pointed out, there is no sign that A61 suggested a “workaround” or circumvention of the URA rules

In OS 871, Daisho had unsuccessfully attempted to set aside the Award. In the Fresh Evidence Applications, Daisho sought to introduce fresh evidence (discovered in the preparation of the present suit) that would allegedly have shown that AST2 had obtained the Award by perjury. In other words, Daisho’s argument had essentially been that AST2’s witnesses (including Mr Choy) had <span class="font-italic">lied in the Arbitration</span> and that the new evidence would prove this.

</div> Both the draft and the final letter listed the storeys of the Development that the Hotel comprised, then respectively stated: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “All these areas (27526.46sqm) will be controlled and managed by Westin Hotel for the exclusive use of hotel guests and patrons”; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “All these areas would be managed by Starwood, pursuant to the terms of a management agreement, for the exclusive use of Hotel guests and patrons”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I shall refer to the text in sub-paragraphs 60(a) and (b) as the “Disputed Words”. Daisho’s counsel latched onto the inclusion of the Disputed Words to support the Advice having been made. Presumably, this was because paragraphs 7(a) and 7(d) of the statement of claim alleged that A61 had advised AST2 that “so long as the … Facilities stayed within and as part of the Westin Hotel, this would be complying with the primary focus of the Use Restrictions” and “so long as the … Facilities remained under the Westin Hotel’s control … that would be in line with the Use Restrictions”. I disagree with Daisho’s counsel. Even if A61 had made no comment on the inclusion of the Disputed Words, counsel was incorrect to focus on the words “managed by Westin Hotel …” and completely ignore the words “for the exclusive use of” hotel guests and patrons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The second set of correspondence in 2013 eventually led to the Third LOU.

</div> MGP then emailed Ms Ooi to ask what this meant, and she replied to say “[i]t means URA don’t control access by public to the hotel spaces, they only control the quantum, commercial quantum if accessible by public”. Mr Ngu explained in cross-examination that there was a minimum quantum for Hotel GFA that had to be met. If a space was accessible to the public, that area would not count towards the hotel quantum. The URA did not control what facilities should or should not be accessible to the public, just that in the former case the facilities would count towards commercial quantum and not hotel quantum.

</div> What Mr Ngu said was that if the Facilities were accessible to the public they could not be counted under the hotel quantum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The third set of correspondence was in late September 2013. On 27 September 2013, Mr Lee Beng Kian (“Mr Lee”) of the Hotel had written to Ms Ooi and Ms Yik regarding the difficulties faced by the Hotel in obtaining food licences from the National Environment Agency (“NEA”): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. Lobby Lounge: Terminology. According to NEA, Lounge is a place where only drinks are served. If we want to serve food, it has to be a cafe/restaurant/snack bar. If this is the case, according to NEA, the terminology in the BP plan needs to be amended. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4· Cook &amp; Brew: Same as above. Currently on the BP this is termed as Guest Lounge. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5· Executive Lounge: Same as above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The difficulty arose because the NEA’s position was that in order to serve food, the relevant premises had to be called a “café”, “restaurant” or “bar” as opposed to a lounge. Ms Ooi replied on the same day and attached an explanation letter she had drafted to the NEA. She stated that “I spoken [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to Mr Wee Ming from NEA, he mentioned that he is not concerned about minor discrepancies on the kitchen layout. What he require for L32 is a single layout showing Seasonal Tastes seating areas and kitchen areas”.

</div> Daisho’s counsel attempted to get some mileage out of this response by asking Ms Ooi during cross-examination whether she had explained to Mr Lee that the relevant premises could not be termed or operated as a “restaurant” as that entailed letting the public access the same. He then asked whether it would be reasonable to assume, with Ms Ooi’s knowledge of the matter, that the Hotel intended to open that facility to members of the public. Ms Ooi stated that this had not crossed her mind.

It is unnecessary to determine this issue. As I have explained, Daisho’s case fails in any event because its position was that it was not aware of the Advice and hence it could not have acted on the Advice. It was also unmeritorious and disingenuous for Daisho to allege that the Advice was manifested via the Tour and Draft Budget because A61 was not involved in these. Be that as it may and on the assumption that A61 did render the Advice to AST2, I shall address the issue of whether A61 owes a duty of care to Daisho. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The basic principles are not in dispute. According to <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”), to establish a duty of care the plaintiff must show that the harm is factually foreseeable, the relationship between the parties is sufficiently proximate, and that there are no policy considerations that negate the finding of a duty of care (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [77], [81] and [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Factual foreseeability or reasonable foreseeability is “a threshold question which the court must be satisfied is fulfilled, failing which the claim does not even take off”: <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [76].

The focus here is necessarily on the closeness of the relationship between the parties themselves” [original emphasis omitted]: <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [77]. This embraces physical, circumstantial and causal proximity as well as notions of assumption of responsibility and reliance (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [77]–[79], citing <span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span> <span class="font-italic">Shire Council</span><span class="font-italic"> v Heyman </span>(1985) 60 ALR 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 55–56): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The requirement of proximity is directed to the relationship between the parties in so far as it is relevant to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff.

I note that due diligence was in fact done in this case, and as explained further below, Daisho’s advisers could easily have noticed the Use Restrictions. An architect could reasonably expect a buyer to approach the deal carefully because of the potential repercussions in this extremely high value transaction. Mr Kohda stated in his affidavit that he had seen the Draft Budget, which indicated revenue from both residents and non-residents.

</div> This should have piqued his curiosity, since on his own evidence he had not come across any five-star hotel that was not open to the public (which would necessitate a distinction between residents and non-residents). But he failed to probe further or direct his advisers to study this limitation of the Hotel despite its potential significance. Daisho would have had to analyse the implications of the Advice and Use Restrictions on the profitability and revenue income of the Hotel during its operation. Daisho would also have had to ascertain the extent to which the Advice and Use Restrictions would affect the potential value of the Hotel.

A61 was not in any antecedent relationship with Daisho. It had been engaged to act as architect by AST2 for the Development, part of which formed the Hotel. Several years later, in a separate transaction, AST2 contracted to sell the Hotel to Daisho. There was no direct or indirect contact between A61 and Daisho at any relevant juncture, be it during the negotiation of the SPA, the Tour or review of the Draft Budget. Thus, it is inconceivable that Daisho, the buyer of the Hotel, would believe A61 owe any duty or responsibility towards Daisho, particularly because the SPA was conducted on an arm’s length and <span class="font-italic">caveat emptor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Secondly, there was no voluntary assumption of responsibility by A61.

</div> An architect gives advice within the confines of its relationship with its client, tailored to the facts and at a specific point in time. While that advice can be said to “belong to” the client in the sense of being commissioned by the client (who is free to do as it pleases, including passing it to a third party), that does not mean the architect assumes responsibility to parties to whom that advice is conveyed <span class="font-italic">by the client</span>, without the architect being consulted or giving further input. Circumstances change and advice that might have been appropriate when it was given to the client can become obsolete by the time the client passes it on. The architect cannot, by any stretch, be taken to have assumed responsibility for the advice to the third party at a later date. Seen in that light, a claim for economic loss arising from negligent misstatement differs materially from a claim for physical damage arising from negligent construction, or even economic loss arising from negligent construction (in the sense of expenses incurred to rectify damage, see <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers (formerly known as Raglan Squire &amp; Partners FE) v MCST Plan No 1075 and anor </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 134<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For this reason, the case of <span class="font-italic">Hunt and others v Optima (Cambridge) Ltd and others </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Hunt</span>”) cited by Daisho is distinguishable. In <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span>, the claimant purchasers of flats sued the builders and the architects because of defective building works. The builders had engaged the architects to inspect the buildings and issue certificates for the flats for the benefit of the purchasers and their lenders. The claimants alleged that the certificates amounted to negligent misstatements that founded a cause of action in tort. The English Court of Appeal held, reversing the findings of the trial judge, that the claim in negligent misstatement had to fail because there was no reliance on the certificates (the certificates had post-dated exchange and completion by the claimants). For our purposes, <span class="font-italic">Hunt </span>does not assist Daisho in establishing proximity because there the architects had issued certificates specifically for the benefit of the purchasers and their lenders and the court had found the architects knew the purchasers were likely to receive a draft of the certificate. In this case I have found that A61 did not and could not be expected to know that any advice it rendered would be passed on to Daisho, the buyer of the Hotel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Daisho relies on the evidence of Mr Choy, Mr Rada, Mr Kohda and Mr Kikuchi to argue that A61 knew or should have known its advice would be made available to Daisho.

To the contrary, A61 cannot be faulted if it were to expect purchasers in such high-value and arm’s length land transactions to conduct their own due diligence. Crucially, Mr Kikuchi for Daisho accepted during cross-examination that A61 would expect the buyer of the Hotel to have conducted due diligence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  Before leaving this point on proximity, I would like to comment on two clauses that A61 relies on. The first is cl 11 of the MOA, a confidentiality clause. A61 argues that because of cl 11, A61 would not expect any advice they gave to AST2 to be made available to third parties. I do not agree with this submission as cl 11 does not impose <span class="font-italic">reciprocal</span> duties of confidentiality on both A61 and AST2. This clause imposes a <span class="font-italic">unilateral </span>obligation on A61 not to disclose information on the Project. In other words, nothing in the clause prevents AST2 from doing what it pleases with the advice it commissioned. Clause 11 of the MOA states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">CONFIDENTIALITY RELATING TO THE WORKS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.01 All information on the Project is confidential and <span class="font-italic">shall not be disclosed by the Architect</span> [A61] to any other person, firm or Company with exception to the Employer’s consultants and contractors engaged to perform works for this Project. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The second is cl 23.2 of the SPA, an entire agreement clause that A61 claims precludes Daisho from relying on any representations by A61 or AST2.

</div> it is unclear whether the entire agreement clause precludes reliance by Daisho on alleged misrepresentations in tort in proceedings taken out against a third party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, A61) to the SPA. Be that as it may, these two different provisions are not directly relevant and will not affect the outcome of this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In any case, policy considerations would have negated any <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care on A61. In negligence cases, there is always a concern of opening the floodgates of liability if the scope of the duty of care is drawn too widely. Therefore, the court must guard against the spectre of imposing liability “in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class”: <span class="font-italic">RSP Architects Planners &amp; Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 653 at [75]. Precisely that danger would arise in this case if a duty of care to Daisho were imposed on A61, because that would mean A61 potentially owes a duty to any buyer of the Hotel down the road, no matter how far removed in time or space, as long as the purported Advice is transmitted to that buyer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The second policy consideration against imposing a duty of care on A61 is that doing so would undermine the rule of <span class="font-italic">caveat emptor</span>.

</div> This means that AST2 would provide any documents to Daisho regardless of whether or not there was a “physical data room” that was labelled as such. Daisho’s argument may be semantic but what is important is substance over form. Essentially, Mr Kohda admitted that AST2 would furnish any documents upon request. Thus, AST2 did not refuse any request for documents from Daisho. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 But even assuming there was no physical data room and that the LOUs were not in the virtual data room, Daisho has not made out its case.

</div> that it was <span class="font-italic">AST2’s responsibility</span> to ensure that Daisho and its advisers had access to all relevant documents for due diligence purposes. Given that documents relating to the Use Restrictions would be very relevant to Daisho at that time, if AST2 did not disclose documents relating to the Use Restrictions to Daisho it would be AST2’s fault. If the documents on the Use Restrictions (in particular, the First LOU and the Second LOU) were shown to Daisho’s advisers (WongP, EC Harris or Aylmer) Daisho would have expected its advisers to bring these documents to its attention.

Clearly, Daisho has no case against A61 and its claim must be dismissed.
