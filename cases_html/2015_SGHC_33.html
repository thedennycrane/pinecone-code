<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two accused persons were separately charged
                    for trafficking in diamorphine on 28 October 2011 but with committing their
                    respective offences in furtherance of the common intention of both. The first
                    accused is a 30-year old Malaysian. The second accused is a 46-year old
                    Singaporean. The drugs were packed in ten packets and the total weight was
                    4497.7g and the contents were analysed and found to be diamorphine weighing not
                    less than 28.5g.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The two accused were charged under
                        s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap
                    185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), read with s 34 of the Penal
                    Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), and punishable under s 33 and s 33B
                    of the Act. Section 5(1)(<em>a</em>) provides as
                    follows –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on
                        his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other
                        person is in Singapore – (a) to traffic in a controlled
                        drug…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 33 provides that any person convicted of an offence of
                        trafficking in a controlled drug shall be punished according to the relevant
                        provision in the Second Schedule. Diamorphine is a Class “A”
                        controlled drug as defined in s 2 of the Act, (under “Specified
                        Drug”). The Second Schedule provides that for offences involving more
                        than 15g of diamorphine, the punishment is death – unless s 33B
                        applies. Section 33B provides that the court may impose a sentence other
                        than death in certain circumstances. On conviction, both accused persons
                        would thus face the death penalty unless s 33B applies to
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 28 October 2011, officers from the
                    Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) saw the second accused carrying a
                    haversack to a bus stop outside the Haw Par Villa at about 11.25am. About five
                    minutes later, the first accused drove a car (a Perodua “Kenari”)
                    with the number plate JLT 8467, to the bus stop and the second accused got into
                    the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first accused then drove along Pasir Panjang
                    Road, making several turns on the way before arriving at a hilltop car park at
                    the National University of Singapore. The car stopped there for about five
                    minutes before going back onto Pasir Panjang Road from South Buona Vista Road.
                    The Kenari was then seen going into an Esso petrol station along Pasir Panjang
                    Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The car was parked near the air pumps in the
                    petrol station. CNB officers observing the car reported that a man came out of
                    the car and walked into the convenience store. Inspector Sea Hoon Cheng
                    testified that it was the second accused who went into the convenience store.
                    The car left the petrol station about 12.12pm and drove along Pasir Panjang Road
                    and the West Coast Highway. It stopped finally at a car park at Block 405,
                    Pandan Gardens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The second accused was seen leaving the car and
                    walking to Block 405. He was carrying a black plastic bag with a golden logo.
                    CNB officers moved in and arrested both accused persons. The first accused was
                    arrested in the car. The haversack carried by the second accused when he first
                    entered the Kenari along Pasir Panjang Road was found on the floor mat of the
                    front passenger seat. Three black plastic bundles were found in the haversack.
                    Two black plastic bags were also found in it as well as one newspaper wrapped
                    bundle. The black plastic bundles and the newspaper wrapped bundles were found
                    to contain granular substances analysed to be diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The second accused was arrested outside his
                    mother’s flat, unit #13-34 of Block 405 Pandan Gardens. The officers
                    searched the Block for the black plastic bag that the second accused was
                    carrying when he went to Block 405, and eventually found it among some flower
                    pots on the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floors. It was
                    searched and found to contain three newspaper wrapped bundles containing
                    granular substances. In total, the ten drug exhibits were analysed and found to
                    contain not less than 28.5g of diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The forensic evidence from Dr Alaric Koh of the
                    Health Sciences Authority showed that the newspaper wrapping found in the
                    haversack could have been from the same set of newspapers as those used to wrap
                    the diamorphine found in the black plastic bag on the staircase landing. The
                    observations and conclusion are found in paragraph 6 of the report marked as
                    P83. The observations of Dr Alaric Koh were based on a “comparison of
                    characteristics, manufacturing cut edges and possible ink transfers”.
                    Forensic evidence also showed that the clear plastic bags containing the ten
                    packets of diamorphine were manufactured by the same machine. The heat seals on
                    the clear plastic bags were also from the same sealing machine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DNA of the first accused was found on both
                    sides of the tapes used to bundle one of the black plastic bundles in the
                    haversack. His DNA was also found on the interior surface of the black plastic
                    bag of one of the three black plastic bundles in the haversack. In his
                    statements to the police, he admitted helping to put the black plastic bundles
                    into the haversack. However, he denied that he knew what were in those bundles.
                    He also referred to the person with the haversack who got into his car, and whom
                    he helped, as “Ah Boy”. The second accused testified that he got
                    into the car driven by an Indian man at the date and time stipulated in the
                    charge. He admitted that he was given a black plastic bag by that Indian man and
                    told to put it along the staircase of the 6<sup>th</sup> or
                        7<sup>th</sup> storey of Block 405. He opened the black
                    plastic bag and saw three bundles wrapped in newspapers. He denied knowing what
                    were in the three bundles and stated that he did not ask the Indian man what
                    they contained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the evidence adduced above, I was satisfied
                    that the prosecution had proved its case against both accused as charged. The
                    identity of the two persons in the Kenari car were not disputed and I thus find
                    that the prosecution had proven the fact that the diamorphine were in the
                    possession of both accused when they were in the car and that they transported
                    the diamorphine from the Esso Station to Pandan Gardens with the common
                    intention of trafficking in the drugs. I thus called upon both accused to enter
                    upon their defence. They elected to testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The first accused raised the defence of
                    ignorance. He claimed that he did not know that the plastic bags contained drugs
                    and that he had no common intention of trafficking drugs with the second
                    accused. His case was that the drug trafficking transaction that day was carried
                    out by the second accused and coordinated by one Puni. The first accused
                    admitted in his statements to the CNB that he knew Puni but asserted his
                    association with Puni as innocuous. He accepted Puni’s offer to deliver
                    the car to his (Puni’s) friend, “relax for about an hour and I
                    could drive the car back to Malaysia after his friend returned it”. He
                    claimed that Puni told him that his friend needed the car to deliver some
                    personal documents. The first accused was suspicious and asked Puni what sort of
                    documents they were. According to the first accused, Puni pulled out a bunch of
                    documents which seemed like documents relating to property transactions and
                    showed them to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first accused stated that on the material
                    day, 28 October 2011, Puni showed him the documents and said that they were
                    illegal and that was why the transaction had to be hidden behind the speakers in
                    the car. He told the first accused that his job was to drive the car from
                    Malaysia to Singapore and pass the car to “Ah Boy” and wait for
                    “Ah Boy” to return the car to him, after which, he was to drive it
                    back to Malaysia. At trial, the first accused identified the second accused as
                    “Ah Boy”. He picked up the second accused at Pasir Panjang Road
                    and drove him around until they arrived at the Esso Station where he got out. He
                    went into the convenience store to buy drinks. He testified that when he
                    returned to the car, he saw that the boot was open and he asked the second
                    accused what he was doing. The second accused told him that he was pumping air
                    into the tyres. The first accused then got back into the car where he saw
                    “some black coloured bundles on the front passenger seat”. He
                    testified that he put the black bundles into the haversack for the second
                    accused because he was asked to help. The second accused then asked him to drive
                    to Block 405 which he did. There, the second accused took some bundles from the
                    haversack and left but told the first accused to wait for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second accused similarly raised the
                    defence of ignorance. He had taken a ride from the Indian man driving the Kenari
                    and when he arrived at Block 405, the Indian man took out a black plastic
                    bag from the rear passenger seat and gave it to him. He was instructed to leave
                    it at the staircase of the 6<sup>th</sup> or
                        7<sup>th</sup> floor of Block 405. He testified that he met
                    the Indian man, who he now identified as the first accused, on 28 October
                    2011 with the view of having lunch with him. He then testified that after
                    getting into the Kenari, the first accused drove him along various roads,
                    finally ending at the Esso Station where he got out and went into the
                    convenience store to buy a drink. When he returned to the car he saw that the
                    boot was open but there was nothing suspicious about it. There was no cogent
                    reason why he agreed to meet the first accused that day. He had only met the
                    first accused once before and had no business with him. The only connection was
                    the vague, almost implied, belief that the first accused was going to help him
                    find work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the accused persons to rebut the
                    presumption of trafficking in the drugs found in their possession their
                    explanations must be cogent and consistent. I am not satisfied that they were.
                    By the second accused’s account, the first accused agreed to meet the
                    second accused on that day for the purpose of lunching with him. Their conduct
                    – driving around and making stops in a car park and a petrol station
                    – was not convincing. They spent all the time driving aimlessly and making
                    the two stops and then decided that that they no longer had time for
                    lunch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second accused testified that when he
                    returned from the convenience store to the Kenari car and saw the black bundles
                    in the passenger seat he “was shocked”. Even without any
                    explanation acceptable to him, he helped put those bundles into his haversack.
                    Then he said, astonishingly, that he was late for his Friday prayers near his
                    mother’s home. The first accused took him there and asked that he drop a
                    few bundles off at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor staircase. There is
                    no doubt in my mind that the second accused person’s story that he was
                    meeting the first accused for lunch, and the first accused person’s story
                    that he met the second accused on 28 October 2011 only because their common
                    friend Puni told him that the second accused wanted to meet him, are inherently
                    contradictory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Evidence that is required to corroborate
                    testimony will sometimes contain conflicting aspects, but they may not be
                    rejected as untruthful if there are reasons for the discrepancies that the
                    finder of fact accepts. Some of the strangest stories ever told have turned out
                    to be true; and some of the vilest lies have been sold through the mouths of
                    straight faces. Fact-finding is a practised art, and it is probably impossible
                    to discuss that subject comprehensively in this judgment. It is also not
                    necessary to do so here because there is a crucial lie that further unravelled
                    the defences of both the accused persons. Inspector Sea of the CNB testified
                    that he saw the second accused walk into the Cheers convenience store after the
                    Kenari stopped at the Esso Station. Neither accused denied that they went to the
                    Esso Station, but both claimed to be the one who went into the convenience
                    store. The reason for that claim was evident as they both knew that the black
                    plastic bundles appeared on the passenger seat while the person in the
                    driver’s seat was alone in the car. Both accused tried to disassociate
                    themselves from the appearance of the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Taking into account the evidence of Inspector
                    Sea, I am inclined to believe that it was the second accused who went into the
                    convenience store. So it was likely that the second accused was telling the
                    truth on this point and the first accused had told the lie. Further, the second
                    accused testified that he saw the first accused closing the boot of the car.
                    This was, in an unintended way, corroboration of the first accused’s
                    evidence that Puni had previously hidden documents in the speakers in the boot.
                    On this occasion, the first accused denied checking the boot because that would
                    directly implicate him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although the second accused was likely to be
                    telling the truth in saying that he and not the first accused went into the
                    convenience store, his evidence thereafter raised questions that were not
                    answered. He said that he returned to the car and saw black bundles that shocked
                    him, but he did not protest when the first accused told him that he needed to
                    put some of the bundles inside his (the second accused) haversack. He said that
                    he merely unzipped the haversack and the first accused put some of the black
                    bundles into it. This part of his evidence was to explain the bundles found in
                    his haversack. Instead of protesting, the second accused said that he was
                    already late and needed to go for his Friday prayers. When they arrived at
                    Pandan Gardens the first accused reached over the passenger seat and took a
                    black plastic bundle which he handed to the second accused and told him to place
                    on the flower pots between the 6<sup>th</sup> and
                        7<sup>th</sup> floor staircase landing. The second accused
                    did just that and then went up to his mother’s flat where he was
                    arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I do not believe that the first accused would
                    have so readily dropped off the black plastic bag (with the drugs) at the
                    staircase landing in Pandan Gardens, a place that, from the evidence, was
                    determined by chance for that was where the second accused told him he was
                    headed. The second accused repeated that he was late for his prayers at least
                    twice but his general evidence suggested otherwise, not least because he did not
                    say what exactly at what time he needed to be at the mosque and why that time
                    could not be changed or his prayers delayed, but also because he went for what
                    appeared to be a pointless car ride and stopover. He hardly knew the first
                    accused; he had no specific reason to meet the first accused on that day other
                    than for a lunch date which he did not seem to care much about and which was
                    cancelled because he was late for his prayers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The absence of a common purpose of the meeting
                    between the two accused persons is a strong indictment in itself in the
                    circumstances, but their respective versions, already weakened by their mutual
                    contradictions, do not make sense even on their own. I am thus satisfied beyond
                    reasonable doubt that both accused knew that the black plastic bags contained
                    diamorphine and they acted with the common intention of trafficking in them in
                    the manner of the second accused dropping part of them off at Block 405 Pandan
                    Gardens. I do not think that their testimonies raised any reasonable doubt as to
                    whether they had the diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking. I thus found
                    them guilty and convicted them as charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The facts as I have found also suggest that
                    the involvement of the two accused were probably restricted to the acts
                    described in s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the Misuse of
                    Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), namely, the mere transporting and delivering
                    of the drugs. By virtue of s 33B(1) the mandatory death penalty will not
                    apply if the accused satisfies the condition in s 33B(2)(a)(i) - as the two
                    accused before me have – and the Public Prosecutor certifies that he has
                    also substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities
                        (s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>)). In this case, the Public
                    Prosecutor did not object to the submissions of the accused that they had
                    satisfied s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>), but he will not grant
                    the certificate to the second accused under s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>). That being the case, my finding under
                        s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>)(i) will not save the second
                    accused from the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     However, by the statutory amendments that
                    brought in ss 33B(1) and (2), there is one further chance for an accused
                    person to escape the death penalty. Under s 33B(1)(<em>b</em>) and s 33B(3), the accused person who has satisfied
                    s 33B(2) but fails to obtain the PP’s certificate of substantial
                    assistance may be spared the death penalty if he proves that “he was
                    suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of
                    arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by
                    disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his
                    acts and omissions in relation to the offence”. The two accused applied
                    for psychiatric assessment at the adjourned hearing in which the parties made
                    their submissions on sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Deputy Public Prosecutor, Mr Terence Chua, did
                    not object to the application of the first accused because he accepted that a
                    year ago his counsel had asked for a copy of the prosecution’s psychiatric
                    report although the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) has no record of
                    receiving the request. However, Mr Chua objected to the application by the
                    second accused on the ground that it was only made after conviction. The last
                    avenue of hope rests on the fact of a mental condition which has to be supported
                    by medical evidence. The court cannot determine that state without medical
                    evidence and it is not right that on a matter of life and death, the issue is
                    determined on the basis of an untested procedure. I therefore granted leave to
                    both accused to obtain psychiatric evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The accused persons were brought before me
                    again on 29 January 2015. Mr Nedumaran, counsel for the first accused,
                    submitted that his client was only a courier and Mr Chua stated that he will not
                    challenge that submission and that the prosecutor has granted the first accused
                    a certificate of substantive assistance. I find no reason from the evidence to
                    find otherwise. I therefore sentenced the first accused to the mandatory life
                    imprisonment with effect from 12 December 2011 and to 15 strokes of the
                    cane under s 33B of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Johan submitted that the second accused was
                    also a courier. Mr Chua does not dispute this but says that the PP will not
                    be issuing a certificate of substantive assistance to the second accused. The
                    second accused also did not produce psychiatric evidence to establish that he
                    was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence. In the
                    circumstances, I have no discretion but to sentence the second accused to suffer
                    death.</p>
