</div> However, the appellant did not state whether he expected the dramatic improvement in profit in 2017 to be a continuing feature, much less the reason for such a big jump. Even at the rate of $800,000 per year, it would take at least six years to clear the balance $4.8m owed. This is assuming the best case scenario for the sale of the Singapore property. If the sale were a forced sale, and the bank is not prevented from doing so by any interim order, there would be a further shortfall of $1.65m, requiring a total of eight years to clear the balance debt on the premise of SAGL being able to repay him at the rate of $800,000 per year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, in order to persuade the court that the proposal is, to cite <span class="font-italic">Re Lim Wee Beng Eddie</span>, “serious and viable”, the appellant must put up a plan that contains sufficient information on how he is able to raise the funds set out in the proposal. He cannot rely on hints and innuendo.

</div> At best, this meant that he will be in a better position to turn SAGL around if he is not made a bankrupt. It does not tell the court how he can achieve it. This was the crucial plank of his proposal, yet what was needed to be said was left unsaid. In so doing, he has not shown that it is a serious proposal and has said nothing on how this would be viable. Furthermore, the analysis above had not taken into account the interest that would continue to accrue on the debts at substantial rates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I gave leave to the appellant to make further arguments after he secured a commitment from the two largest debtors to agree to take a reduction of 45% of their debts on the basis that they would forgive the interest components (which was 13.125% and 12.5%). However, this required the other debtors to take a similar haircut even though the interest owed on their debts was substantially lower. I did not consider it likely that the other creditors would agree to a reduction of 45% of their debt, but even on the basis of such a reduction, the $8m would be reduced to $4.4m, and with a forced sale value of $1.55m, there would still be $2.85m payable. At the optimistic rate of $800,000 per year, this would still take him more than three years to repay. Even at the further arguments stage, the appellant did not take the opportunity given to him to provide more details as to how he could ensure that SAGL would repay its loan each year at a level that he can satisfactorily repay his creditors within a reasonable time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 A bankruptcy order is a serious matter as it concerns debts owed to creditors that are unpaid when due. In the same vein, an application for an interim order is a serious matter because, if granted, it means that creditors who are entitled to resort to a bankruptcy order to enforce their rights to payment will have that right stayed. On the other hand, a debtor who has a serious proposal to make that could satisfy his creditors and thereby avert a bankruptcy order should be given an opportunity to do so. The court has to balance the interests of both sides. The requirement in law is that such a proposal must be serious and viable. In order to enable the court to decide whether a proposal is viable, sufficient details must be given at the outset in order to prevent abuse. The appellant had not explicitly stated in his affidavits how he would be able to procure the repayment by SAGL of its debt of $5.2m and despite a number of hearings in which he would have the opportunity to do so. In fact, he had taken the opportunity in those hearings to disclose undertakings by other creditors to agree to a reduction of debt. Yet in the crucial area of the repayment by SAGL, there was nothing said on affidavit for the court to examine the viability of his proposal. It is incumbent on this court to ensure that applications for interim orders not be used to delay bankruptcy proceedings by requiring such applications to be accompanied by proposals that are serious and viable. If such a proposal is not provided at the outset, a court should dismiss the application. In the present case I have in fact given the opportunity to the appellant to make further arguments regarding his proposal and still did not find it viable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 For the reasons given above, I dismissed the appellant’s application for an interim order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Are there grounds to dismiss the creditor’s bankruptcy application under s 65(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">e</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> of the Act?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Before the registrar, the appellant argued that the bankruptcy application should have been dismissed on the basis of s 65(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act.

</div> Under s 65(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), the court may dismiss a bankruptcy application if it is “satisfied that for other sufficient cause no order ought to be made”. The appellant cited an example in the Registrar’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat Rickie v Sinesinga Sdn Bhd </span>[2014] SGHC 6 (“Rickie Tang”) at [13b], where a court exercised the discretion to dismiss a bankruptcy order where it was made on the basis of evidence which turned out to be untrue: <span class="font-italic">Re Bright, ex p Wingfield and Blew </span>[1903] 1 KB 735.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The appellant contended that it is “untrue” that the Neville’s debt comprised such a proportion of the total debt that he (Neville) had the power to veto any proposal put forward by the appellant.

</div> This argument however turned on the appellant being able to obtain an interim order. As I have determined that such order was not justified, it followed that there was no “sufficient reason” to dismiss the creditor’s bankruptcy application.
