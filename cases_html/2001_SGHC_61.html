<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. This is a dispute over the ownership of funds in joint banking accounts after

one account holder died. These accounts were in the names of the Plaintiff, a lady of 67, and her

late husband Quek Cheok Boon (hereinafter referred to as "the deceased") who died on 18

February 1998. The grant of probate for the deceased's estate was made in favour of the First and

Second Defendants, a son and a daughter of the Plaintiff and the deceased on 17 September 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The deceased held four joint accounts with the Plaintiff -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Account No. 028-19153-7 at the Post Office Savings Bank (now part of DBS

  Bank);</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Account No. 116-127-140-9 at United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOB);</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Time Deposit Account No. 16479002 with Keppel Tat Lee Bank Ltd

  (hereinafter referred to as "the Third Defendant"); and</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) Account No. 24-30089-4 with the Third Defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3. Before the grant of probate to the First and Second Defendants, the Plaintiff

had operated the POSB and UOB accounts. On 17 February 1998 she withdrew $1,183,266.80 from POSB

account No. 028-19153-7 and deposited it into account No. 125-05785-3 held in the names of the

Plaintiff and Quek Li Kheng, another daughter of the Plaintiff and the deceased at the same bank. On

18 February 1998 she withdrew $218,055.87 from UOB account No. 116-127-140-9 and deposited it into

account No. 126/110/722/3 at the same bank. (On 24 February 1998 she withdrew the same sum from the

latter account and deposited it into POSB account No. 125-05785-3.)</p>
<p align="justify">4. After the Second Defendant received the grant she obtained the passbooks for

POSB account No. 028-19153-7 and UOB account No. 116-127-140-9 from the Plaintiff. She took the

position that the monies in these joint accounts belonged to the deceased's estate and demanded that

the Plaintiff return the $1,183,266.80 and $218,055.87 withdrawn from those two accounts.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The Plaintiff withdrew $1,401,322.67 from POSB account No. 125-05785-3 in a

cashier's order made payable to the First and Second Defendants and handed it to the Second

Defendant, but she subsequently obtained legal advice, and now claims the monies as her property.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The Third Defendant became involved through a series of transactions

commencing on 6 August 1998. The Plaintiff claimed that on that day a Teng Cheong Guan (hereinafter

referred to as Teng), an employee of the Third Defendant suggested to her that the sums standing to

her credit in accounts No. 16479002 and No. 24-30089-4 with the Third Defendant could be transferred

into other accounts with the Third Defendant to earn higher rates of interest. When she accepted the

suggestion, Teng produced nine sheets of paper bearing the Third Defendant's letter-head and she

attached her signature to them. The Plaintiff now claims Teng made fraudulent representations to get

her to sign them, and she signed <i>non est factum</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The Plaintiff also alleges that Teng used one of the signed sheets without her

knowledge and consent to close account No. 16479002 which had a credit balance of $1,024,063.54 and

transferred $524,063.54 to a new account No. 24-30156-4 in the sole name of the Plaintiff and placed

the balance of $500,000 into another time deposit account, and that Teng used another signed sheet

to close account No. 24-30089-4 and transfer the balance of $72,144.12 therein to account No.

24-30156-4.</p>
<p align="justify">8. On 4 September 1998, the Third Defendant transferred $588,000 from account No.

24-30156-4 and paid it into account No. 24-72217-9 in the joint names of the First and Second

Defendants. The Plaintiff alleged that this was done without her approval and that another of the

signed sheets was used to enable this to be done.</p>
<p align="justify">9. On 7 September 1998 the Third Defendant transferred $500,000 from account No.

86219001 to account No. 24-72217-9. The Plaintiff alleged that this transfer was done without her

consent, and that another signed sheet was used for the purpose.</p>

<p align="justify"> </p>
</font><i>
<p align="justify">The action</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">10. The Plaintiff's action against the First, Second and Third Defendants was

filed on 29 February 2000. The Plaintiff seeks declarations that the $1,401,322.67, $500,000 and

$588,000 belong absolutely and beneficially to her and do not form part of the deceased's estate,

and she wants those sums to be repaid to her. The First and Second Defendants deny her claim and

assert that the money is a part of the deceased's estate.</p>
<font size="4">
<p align="justify"> </p>
</font><i>
<p align="justify">The proposed amendments</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">11. On 29 May 2000 an application was filed by the Plaintiff to add the Fourth

Defendant as a party and to amend the Statement of Claim. The Fourth Defendant Saranya Sae-Ngow is

the wife of Quek Peng Hock, another son of the Plaintiff and the deceased. She became involved

because she was a holder with the First and Second Defendants of accounts No. 8-6084013 and No.

24-722179 at the Third Defendant into which $1,401,322.67 was paid. (She has ceased to be a holder

of these accounts.)</p>
<p align="justify">12. The proposed amendments are intended to add new claims against the Defendants

based on fraud, malice and conspiracy. Allegations of fraud, malice and conspiracy are repeated

throughout the proposed amendments. The main assertions are in</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) a new paragraph 13 -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">13. On or about the 24<sup>th</sup> February 1998 the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>

    and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants wrongfully and maliciously conspired and combined amongst

    themselves to defraud and to injure the Plaintiff by obtaining from her the cashier's order for

    the said sum and fraudulently deposited the said cashier's order into 2 accounts with the 3<sup>rd</sup>

    Defendant in the joint names of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants

    as hereinafter pleaded without the Plaintiff's knowledge consent or approval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(ii) the proposed re-numbered paragraph 14 (with the proposed amendments in

  italics) -</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. </p></blockquote></i>The 1<sup>st</sup>, <i>2<sup>nd</sup> </i>and <i>4<sup>th</sup></i>

    Defendants have wrongfully claimed and continue to claim, that the said sum was beneficially

    solely owned by the Deceased and forms part of the Deceased's estate, and <i>treated the said

    sum as their joint asset which they deposited it in 2 accounts in their joint names with the 3<sup>rd</sup>

    Defendant on the 24<sup>th</sup> February 1998 without the knowledge consent or approval of the

    Plaintiff. Particulars of the 2 accounts are as follows:-

    <p align="justify">(1) 24.2.98 Deposit of $1,400,000 into Account No. 86084013 (hereinafter

    referred to as "Account D" - the deception account) with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant

    fraudulently in the joint names of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants</p>
<p align="justify">(2) 24.2.98 Deposit of $1,322.67 into Account No. 24-72217-9 (hereinafter

    referred to as "Account F" - the fraud account) with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant also

    fraudulently in the joint names of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants</p>
<p align="justify">The Plaintiff will at the trial of this action refer to the statements of the

    above Accounts kept by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant with the knowledge of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>

    and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants or alternatively in conspiracy with the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>

    and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants.</p>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iii) the proposed re-numbered paragraph 19 -</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">19.</p></i> On 4<sup>th</sup> September 1998 the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant,

    without the knowledge, approval or consent of the Plaintiff, <i>fraudulently and maliciously

    conspired with the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants</i> <i>and</i>

    caused the sum of $588,000 to be withdrawn from Account No. 24-30156-4 and paid into Account <i>F</i>

    in the joint names of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> and <i>4<sup>th</sup> </i>Defendants.

    The Plaintiff never authorised or ratified such withdrawal or transfer, which was made without

    her knowledge, approval or consent. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant purports to rely upon a cash

    withdrawal authorization form, printed in English, and signed by the Plaintiff. The said cash

    withdrawal authorization form in one of the said nine sheets was signed by the Plaintiff in

    blank on 6<sup>th</sup> August 1998 in reliance on the oral representation of the 3<sup>rd</sup>

    Defendant's employee Teng Cheong Guan that her signature would be used to effectuate the

    transfer of funds in Time Deposit Account No. 16479002 and Account No. 24-30089-4 onto other

    accounts for the benefit of the Plaintiff with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.

  </blockquote>
<p align="justify">(iv) the proposed re-numbered paragraph 20 -</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">20.</p></i> On 7<sup>th</sup> September 1998, the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant,

    without the knowledge, approval or consent of the Plaintiff, <i>fraudulently and maliciously

    conspired with the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants and</i> caused

    the sum of $500,000 to be withdrawn from Account No. 86219001 and paid into Account <i>F</i> in

    the joint names of the 1s<sup>t,</sup> 2<sup>nd</sup> and <i>4<sup>th</sup> </i>Defendants. The

    Plaintiff never authorised or ratified such withdrawal or transfer, which was made without her

    knowledge, approval or consent. The Third Defendant purports to rely upon a general request

    form, printed in English on one of the said nine sheets and signed by the Plaintiff. The said

    general request form was signed by the Plaintiff in blank on 6th August 1998 in reliance on the

    oral representation of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant's employee Teng Cheong Guan that her

    signature would be used to effectuate the transfer of funds in Time Deposit Account No. 16479002

    and Account No. 24-30089-4 onto other accounts for the benefit of the Plaintiff with the 3<sup>rd</sup>

    Defendant.

  </blockquote>
<p align="justify">(v) the proposed re-numbered paragraph 21 -</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">21.</p></i> The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and <i>4<sup>th</sup></i>

    Defendants have wrongfully <i>and fraudulently</i> claimed and continue to claim, that the said

    sums of $500,000 and $588,000 were beneficially solely owned by the Deceased and form part of

    the Deceased's estate, and have claimed the total sum of <i>$1,088,000 which the 1<sup>st</sup>,

    2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants fraudulently and maliciously deposited into Account

    F as their joint account with the assistance of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant as banker in their

    joint names as pleaded in paragraphs 19 and 20 hereof.

    </i>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) the proposed re-numbered paragraph 25 -</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">25.</p></i> By reason of the fact that the transfers of the said sums of $500,000

    and $588,000 out of accounts in the sole name of the Plaintiff into <i>Account F</i> in the

    names of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Defendants were made <i>in

    pursuance and in furtherance of the malicious conspiracy</i> by <i>all</i> the Defendant<i>s</i>
<i>fraudulently</i> without authority and unlawfully, the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage

    in the sum of $1,088,000.

  </blockquote>
<p align="justify">13. In her affidavit in support of her application to amend, the Plaintiff

deposed that</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> I am of the view that the 3 joint accountees have acted in concert to

    defraud me and the fraud was perpetuated in pursuance and in furtherance of a conspiracy which I

    am required to plead if I seek to rely on it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(f)rom certain documents sent to my Solicitors by Executors' Solicitors

    containing various statements of accounts of the sum of $1,401,322.67 taken from me and from the

    transfers of that sum from my account to the joint accounts of the 3 joint accountees, I have

    reason to believe that those 3 joint accountees with the help of the Bank were acting

    fraudulently and maliciously in concert against me and I am advised by my Solicitors and verily

    believe that the evidence of the said transfers of my monies ending in the accounts of the 3

    joint accountees is evidence of conspiracy on the part of all the defendants to defraud me.

    Accordingly, I wish to plead conspiracy and I am advised by my Solicitors and verily believe

    that I am required to amend my Statement of Claim to include a claim for damages for conspiracy.

    </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. The application to join the Fourth Defendant was granted. The application to

amend the Statement of Claim was resisted by all the Defendants, and was dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">15. In his written submissions Mr Chung, counsel for the Plaintiff quoted from

20/8/10 of The Supreme Court Practice 1999 (hereinafter referred to as "the White Book")

that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> a plaintiff will be allowed to amend by adding a claim for special damage

  when proof of special damage is essential to the cause of action (<i>Weldon v. Neal</i> (1887) 19

  Q.B.D. 394) or to add a new claim which is "so germane to, and so connected with, the

  original cause of action, that it would be a denial of justice" if leave to add it were

  refused. (<i>Att.-Gen. v. West Ham Corp. </i>(1910) 74 J.P. 196, CA). A plaintiff may add a new

  cause of action, the defendant a new defence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and he submitted that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(t)he amendment is now made necessary because of the accounts received by the

  Plaintiff at a very late date i.e. on 15.5.00 which show clearly that there was a conspiracy to

  defraud the Plaintiff by not only the 2 Defendants but also another party, Saranya -the fraud

  being the opening of the various accounts said to be Estate accounts in the names of not only the

  Executors but of Saranya.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">16. The main objections to the amendments relevant to this appeal were that no

particulars of fraud were pleaded and that the Plaintiff would succeed if she can show that she is

entitled to the money in the joint accounts with the deceased without having to establish undue

influence, constructive trusteeship or fraud, and the proposed amendments would delay the trial of

the action.</p>
<p align="justify">17. The Assistant Registrar who heard the application dismissed it, noting</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The real issue in dispute between the parties is one of the beneficial

  ownership of the monies in the joint accounts. The further purported claims founded on conspiracy

  and fraud, apart from being poorly pleaded and particularised, also did not add anything further

  to the Plaintiff main claim. Indeed they will only eclipse the real dispute between the parties

  and unnecessarily delay the trial of the action. Consequently, I disallowed the application to

  amend the pleadings to add the pleas of fraud and conspiracy. However, I am of the view that the

  Plaintiff is entitled to pursue an action for amount and/or repayment from the 4<sup>th</sup>

  Defendant who managed the disputed accounts at some point. I therefore give the Plaintiff liberty

  to apply to amend the statement of claim to seek the reliefs presently sought against the 1<sup>st</sup>,

  2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants, subject to the above remarks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The further amendments</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">18. The Plaintiff appealed against his decision. When the appeal came on for

hearing on 31 October 2000 Mr Chung made further amendments to the proposed amendments so that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the former proposed re-numbered paragraph 19 be re-numbered paragraph 18

  and be further amended to read (with the further amendments in italics)</p>
<p align="justify">18. On <i>or about</i> 4<sup>th</sup> September 1998 the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  Defendant, without the knowledge, approval or consent of the Plaintiff, <i>fraudulently and

  caused the sum of $588,000 to be withdrawn from Account No. 24-30156-4 and paid into Account <i>F</i>

  August 1998 in reliance on the oral representation of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant's employee Teng

  Cheong Guan that her signature would be used to effectuate the transfer of funds in Time Deposit

  Account No. 16479002 and Account No. 24-30089-4 onto other accounts for the benefit of the

  Plaintiff with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19. Mr Chung submitted that the amendments should be allowed because the object

of the court in determining whether to grant leave to amend is to enable the pleadings to reflect

the real issues in dispute, and parties should not be penalised for mistakes made in the conduct of

their cases, if such errors can be corrected without doing injustice to the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">20. After hearing counsel, I dismissed the appeal on two grounds. Firstly, I

agreed with the Assistant Registrar that the proposed amendments were defective for the absence of

particulars of the fraud, malice and conspiracy alleged.</p>
<p align="justify">21. Order 18 rule 12(1)(a) and (b) of the Rules of Court prescribe that</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">12.- Subject to paragraph (2), every pleading must contain the necessary

  particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, without prejudice to the

  generality of the foregoing words</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) particulars of any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful

    default or undue influence on which the party pleading relies; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) where a party pleading alleges any condition of the mind of any person,

    whether any disorder or disability of mind or any malice, fraudulent intention or other

    condition of mind except knowledge, particulars of the facts on which the party relies.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">22. The function of particulars is set out in the White Book at 18/12/2 thus -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The requirement to give particulars reflects the overriding principle that the

  litigation between the parties, and particularly the trial, should be conducted fairly, openly,

  without surprises and, as far as possible, so as to minimise costs (a view approved by

  Edmund-Davies L.J. in <i>Astrovlanis Compania Naviera SA v. Linard</i> [1972] 2 Q.B. 611; [1972] 2   All E.R. 647) The function of particulars is accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) to inform the other side of the nature of the case that they have to meet

    as distinguished from the mode in which that case is to be proved (<i>per</i> Lindley L.J. in <i>Duke

    v. Wisden</i> (1897) 77 L.T. 67 at 68, <i>per</i> Buckley L.J. in <i>Young &amp; Co. v. Scottish

    Union Co.</i> (1907) 24 T.L.R. 73 at 74; <i>Aga Khan v. Times Publishing Co</i>. [1924] 1 K.B.

    675 at 679);</p>
<p align="justify">(2) to prevent the other side from being taken by surprise at the trial (<i>per</i>

    Cotton L.J., in <i>Spedding v.</i> <i>Fitzpatrick</i> (1888) 38 Ch.D. 410 at 413; <i>Thomson v.

    Birkley</i> (1882) 31 W.R. 230);</p>
<p align="justify">(3) to enable the other side to know with what evidence they ought to be

    prepared and to prepare for trial (<i>per</i> Cotton L.J. ibid.; <i>per</i> Jessel M.R. in <i>Thorp

    v. Holdsworth</i> (1876) 3 Ch.D. 637 at 639; <i>Elkington v. London Association for the

    Protection of Trade</i> (1911) 27 T.L.R. 329 at 330);</p>
<p align="justify">(4) to limit the generality of the pleadings (<i>per</i> Thesiger L.J. <i>Saunders

    v. Jones</i> (1877) 7 Ch.D. 435) or of the claim or the evidence (<i>Milbank v. Milbank</i>

    [1900] 1 Ch. 376 at p.385);</p>
<p align="justify">(5) to limit and define the issues to be tried, and as to which discovery is

    required (<i>Yorkshire Provident Life Assurance Co. v. Gilbert</i> [1895] 2 Q.B. 148, <i>per </i>Vaughan

    Williams L.J. in <i>Milbank v. Milbank</i> [1900] 1 Ch. 376 at 385);</p>
<p align="justify">(6) to tie the hands of the party so that he cannot without leave go into any

    matters not included (<i>per</i> Brett L.J. in <i>Philipps v. Philipps</i> (1878) 4 Q.B.D. 127

    at 133; <i>Woolley v. Broad</i> [1892] 2 Q.B. 317) see n. "All material facts" para.

    18/7/11; and <i>Woolley v. Broad</i> [1892] 2 Q.B. 317). But if the opponent omits to ask for

    particulars, evidence may be given which supports any material allegation in the pleadings (<i>Dean

    of Chester v. Smelting Corp</i>. [1902] W.N. 5; <i>Hewson v. Cleve</i> [1904] 2 Ir.R. 536).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">23. The Assistant Registrar was right in finding that the proposed amendments

before him were poorly pleaded and particularised. The affidavit deposed by the Plaintiff in support

of her application showed that there was very little that she can identify to substantiate the

charges of fraud, malice and conspiracy.</p>
<p align="justify">24. No explanation was offered for making the further amendments in the course of

the appeal. It was not stated whether the Plaintiff accepts the Assistant Registrar's finding and

makes the further amendments on account of it, or she does not accept the ruling but is making the

amendments nevertheless.</p>
<p align="justify">25. In any event, the particulars pleaded in the further amendments are not

proper particulars. They refer to agreements between the Defendants on 4 September 1998 and 7

September 1998 - the dates on which monies were transferred from accounts in the Plaintiff's name

with the Third Defendant to the joint account of the First and Second Defendants with the Third

Defendant. No particulars were given of the Defendants' fraud and malice or the conspiracy they

hatched.</p>
<p align="justify">26. The requirement for particulars to support a plea of fraud is well settled.

In <i>Wallingford v Mutual Society</i> (1880) 5 App. Cas 685 Lord Selborne held at p 697</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">With regard to fraud, if there be any principle which is perfectly well

  settled, it is that general allegations, however strong may be the words in which they are stated,

  are insufficient even to amount to an averment of fraud of which any Court ought to take notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and Lord Watson concurred, adding at p 709</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> I cannot think that a mere statement that fraud had been committed, is any

  compliance with the words of that rule which require the Defendant to state facts entitling him to

  defend. The rule must require not only a general and vague allegation but some actual fact or

  circumstance or circumstances which taken together imply, or at least very strongly suggest, that

  a fraud must have been committed, those facts being assumed to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">27. The second ground for my decision is that the proposed amendments are not

relevant to the real question of controversy between the parties. As the editors of the White Book

note at para 20/8/6 -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is a guiding principle of cardinal importance on the question of amendment

  that, generally speaking, all such amendments ought to be made "for the purpose of

  determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings or of

  correcting any defect or error in any proceedings" (see, per Jenkins L.J. in <i>G.L. Baker

  Ltd v. Medway Building &amp; Supplies Ltd</i> [1958] 1 W.L.R. 1216 at 1231;[1958] 3 All E.R. 540

  at 546).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">28. The essential question in the Plaintiff's action is whether the monies in the

joint accounts held by her and her late husband belonged to her or his estate upon his death. If

they were hers, her action will succeed without any need to show fraud, malice and conspiracy on the

part of the Defendants. If the money belonged to the estate, fraud, malice and conspiracy on the

part of the Defendants would not make the money hers. Counsel for the First and Second Defendants

accepted that if the Plaintiff is right on the issue of survivorship, his clients are liable without

the claim being amended.</p>
<p align="justify">29. Applicants for amendments are apt to argue that an amendment should be

allowed if it can be made without injustice to the other side and there is no injustice if the other

side can be compensated by costs by relying on Brett M.R.'s pronouncement to that effect in <i>Clarapede

v Commercial Union Association</i> (1883) 32 WR 262. But the test does not stop there. The

usefulness of the proposed amendments should also be considered. The White Book states at 20/8/24</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Court will always look at the materiality of the proposed amendment (<i>Wood

  v. Earl of Durham</i> (1888) 21 Q.B.D. 501). An inconsistent or useless amendment will not be

  allowed (<i>Sinclair v. James</i> [1894] 3 Ch. 554 at 557; <i>Durham v. Robertson</i> [1898] 1   Q.B. 765 at 774; <i>Bevan v. Barnett</i> (1897) 13 T.L.R. 310; <i>C.H. Pearce and Sons Ltd v.

  Storechester Ltd</i> (1983) <i>The Times</i>, November 17, CA ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">30. When Lord Griffiths examined the principles applicable to amendments of

pleadings in <i>Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd</i> [1987] AC 189 he said at p 220 that "a

judge must weigh in the balance  the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in

litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal

business should be conducted efficiently." That applies with equal force in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">31. The proposed amendments will enlarge the areas of dispute, lengthen the

trial, and increase costs. They are useless or immaterial insofar as they do not assist in the

determination of the real question in controversy, and are inimical with the efficient resolution of

the dispute between the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">32. The appeal was dismissed for these reasons. However the Plaintiff does not

accept the outcome, and is taking the matter on appeal again.</p>
