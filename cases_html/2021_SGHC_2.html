</div>
</div> In other words, “the musical works … in [COMPASS’] repertoire” meant “all musical works”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 GV did not, however, plead any facts about COMPASS purporting to have an all-encompassing repertoire to support its interpretation of clause 1 of the Licence. It did have a claim in misrepresentation, but (as I elaborate below) its pleaded misrepresentation was said to be contained in the licence scheme offered by COMPASS to GV, which the parties later signed and entered into as the Licence. Put that way, the misrepresentation claim adds nothing to what the Licence itself says, particularly in clause 1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 GV points to the payment of licence fees being based on 0.2% of its gross receipts to argue that it was licensing from COMPASS all musical works in all movies. This, however, conflates what was licensed, with how the parties agreed licence fees would be calculated. What was licensed is stated in clause 1 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “the musical works for the time being in [COMPASS’] repertoire”) and what the parties agreed that GV would pay for that is stated in clause 2 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the relevant tariff as in force from time to time, which is 0.2% of gross receipts). GV also points to films where <span class="font-italic">none</span> of the musical works were in COMPASS’ repertoire, films where only <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the musical works were in COMPASS’ repertoire, and instances where the copyright in a musical work might be <span class="font-italic">shared </span>(between a composer or author COMPASS represented, and a third party).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 None of this adds to GV’s argument. On the face of clause 1 of the Licence, COMPASS only licensed to GV what was in COMPASS’ repertoire, and by virtue of clause 2, GV agreed to pay for that based on 0.2% of its gross receipts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 GV’s reading of clause 1 is an extreme one. On GV’s case, from the time COMPASS granted the Licence, it would have been in breach of it because it did not have the right to administer copyright in all musical works whatsoever. Even if COMPASS did have the right to administer copyright in all musical works where copyright still subsisted, it would nevertheless have been in breach because some musical works were already in the public domain, and for those works there was no copyright that COMPASS could still administer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Moreover, on GV’s case, COMPASS would need to have the right to administer copyright in all <span class="font-italic">future</span> musical works. If COMPASS did not have the right to administer copyright in a musical work that might one day be composed in a faraway land, which might find its way into a movie screened by GV, COMPASS would be in breach of the Licence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 GV submits that one of COMPASS’ witnesses, its Senior Licensing Manager, Mr Melvin Tan (“Mr Tan”), had agreed that the Licence was a “blanket licence” for all musical works in all movies.

I agree with COMPASS that, as an express term, clause 1 of the Licence did not oblige COMPASS to have the right to administer copyright in all musical works, but only what was in COMPASS’ repertoire for the time being. That is what clause 1 of the Licence says, and that is what it means.

I consider that the proposed implied term is inconsistent with the express term in clause 1 of the Licence, and as such cannot be implied. The proposed implied term would convert a licence of what was in COMPASS’ repertoire, into one for all musical works (which COMPASS could never provide, at least because there are some works already in the public domain). The parties would not have said “[o]h, of course” to such an implication; nor is it necessary for business efficacy (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It follows that COMPASS was not in breach of an express or implied term, in not having the right to administer copyright in all musical works.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did GV enter into the Licence because COMPASS misrepresented that it had the right to administer copyright in all musical works?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">GV’s pleaded case on misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 GV’s pleaded case is that “in or around 22 June 1995”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the Licence was entered into, COMPASS had misrepresented to GV that COMPASS had the “Right” to grant permission to GV to perform publicly, or authorise the public performance of, any or all of the musical works in all movies screened by GV in its cinemas.

</div> and the notice to admit hearsay evidence was given thereafter – after all the witnesses had finished testifying. This diminished the value of the notice (Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) at para 6.042, cited in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2015] 2 SLR 686 at [138] (“<span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span>”)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of notice is to enable the opposing party to carry out his own investigation prior to the trial in order to ascertain its significance and veracity and to secure information which may refute it or reduce its weight (if necessary).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 One of the hearsay exceptions GV relied on is s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Evidence Act”), but to satisfy s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(ii) of the Evidence Act, GV would need to show “that despite reasonable efforts to locate [Mr Lee], he cannot be found whether within or outside Singapore”. GV did not say what efforts it had made to locate Mr Lee (if it had made any efforts at all) – GV’s hearsay notice simply stated that Mr Lee’s address was unknown. Consequently, I find that GV cannot rely on s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Evidence Act in relation to Mr Lee. In <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span> at [101], the Court of Appeal commented that potential witnesses’ resignation from an organisation is a relevant factor to consider, but “[e]vidence as to how they were previously contacted and what efforts had been made to contact them would have been more germane”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Furthermore, why did the hearsay evidence not find its way into the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) of GV’s witnesses in the first place? What Ms Cheo says her predecessor or colleagues had told her about what COMPASS had represented to them, or about why GV had decided to enter into the Licence, was hearsay. If these communications were important to GV’s case, one would have expected to see them in Ms Cheo’s AEIC, and for a notice to admit hearsay evidence to be given no later than two weeks after service of that AEIC, in accordance with O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Perhaps the hearsay evidence was not in the AEICs of GV’s witnesses because GV’s pleaded case on misrepresentation was simply about the licence scheme proposed by COMPASS to GV, which became the Licence. Ms Cheo’s AEIC went further in asking the court to draw inferences from the Licence, and from publicly available information. But she did not mention anything supposedly said by her predecessor or colleagues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Ms Cheo referred to her predecessor or colleagues only when she was cross-examined on GV’s case that the licence scheme (and the Licence) was itself said to be the alleged misrepresentation.

As such, GV cannot rely on s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Evidence Act as a hearsay exception for what Mr Lee supposedly told Ms Cheo. Moreover, given Mr Lee’s potential availability as a witness, and the importance of his evidence, it would not be in the interests of justice to admit the hearsay evidence of what he and the other GV representative (since deceased) had supposedly told Ms Cheo, even if GV could fit the hearsay evidence within one of the subsections in s 32(1) of the Evidence Act: see s 32(3) of the Evidence Act.

This is fanciful and I reject it. The fact that COMPASS was formed two months after the Copyright Act came into force (or even because the Copyright Act came into force) says nothing whatsoever about whether COMPASS had links to the Government.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Ironically, the newspaper articles that GV relies on indicate that COMPASS’ reach only extends to works that are: (a) covered by copyright; and (b) owned by members of COMPASS.

</div> Leong, “Music played at D&amp;Ds”). GV argues that this gave the impression that COMPASS had been vested with authority by the Singapore Government. I disagree: the use of the words “agency”, “officials” and “officers” does not connote that COMPASS was “governmental” in some way. An “advertising agency”, “match officials”, and “bank officers” are not governmental just because the words “agency”, “officials”, and “officers” are used. More fundamentally, the question is not what a newspaper reader might think, but what <span class="font-italic">GV</span> thought when it entered into the Licence with COMPASS, at which point GV knew full well that it was contracting with a limited liability company, not a governmental or quasi-governmental organisation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Did COMPASS create the impression that all musical works were licenced by it?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 GV argues that COMPASS conveyed the message that anyone performing any musical work in public had to obtain a licence from COMPASS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 None of the newspaper articles cited by GV, however, said that COMPASS administered copyright in all musical works, or even that copyright subsisted in all musical works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 To the contrary, in “Join Compass, local composers urged”, <span class="font-italic">The Straits Times</span> (8 November 1989) (“Join Compass”), it was stated: “Compass also aims to make music users, who broadcast <span class="font-italic">copyrighted pieces of music</span>, pay for a broadcast licence.

Furthermore, the reference to publishing houses “such as” the ones named in Leong, “More nightclubs under scrutiny” would indicate that COMPASS did not represent all publishing houses (or it would be simpler to just say so). Nor did the article say that COMPASS represents all composers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Both these articles (“Join Compass” and Leong, “More nightclubs under scrutiny”) indicated that COMPASS was collecting <span class="font-italic">royalties</span>, rather than some tax payable to the Government. The same word “royalties’ is also used in the Licence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In similar vein is Leong, “Music played at D&amp;Ds”, which said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (Compass), a local copyright agency, is stepping up its collection of royalties from companies which play copyrighted music during their social functions. … If these are held in hotels which do not have a special licence for this purpose, each company has to apply for a separate licence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Melvin Tan, Compass’ licensing manager, said he is writing to all listed companies, asking them to apply for such a licence if they intend to play copyrighted music at company functions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Even the wedding march is copyrighted to us, and so couples getting married still have to pay us royalties,’ [he] said. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This article, like those mentioned above, mentioned “copyrighted music” for which “royalties” were payable, again suggesting that there was non-copyrighted music for which royalties need not be paid. Even Mr Tan’s reference to the “Wedding March” was in the context of: (a) there being copyright in the “Wedding March”; and (b) that copyright being administered by COMPASS. This does not suggest that copyright subsisted in all musical works, nor that COMPASS administered copyright in all musical works. Mr Tan was just citing the “Wedding March” as an example of a well-known musical work, that he claimed had copyright administered by COMPASS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The “Wedding March” was, however, a poor example for Mr Tan to have chosen: it had ceased to enjoy copyright protection many years ago, and COMPASS did not administer copyright in it. In fact, COMPASS never did. Mr Tan thus suggested that COMPASS’ repertoire was more extensive than it in fact was, but still, he did not suggest that it was all-encompassing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Later that month, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Straits Times</span> published a letter from Mr Lam on its Forum page (Lam, “Compass will act only as last resort”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under the Copyright Act, any person or organisation which gives or authorises the performance of a musical work in public places must obtain prior consent from the copyright owner.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In practice, Compass has not and will not licence private birthday or wedding parties which only use the songs, Happy Birthday and Wedding March. My licensing manager, Melvin Tan, in the article entitled ‘Music played at D &amp; Ds subject to copyright fee’ (ST, Dec 16), was merely trying to emphasise the point that <span class="font-italic">even these songs are copyrighted</span>, not to mention the <span class="font-italic">many other copyrighted songs</span> which are played at such functions frequently. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Mr Lam did not take the opportunity to correct Mr Tan’s assertion that the “Wedding March” had copyright administered by COMPASS. Indeed, he furthered the incorrect assertion that there was still copyright in the “Wedding March”, by saying “even these songs are copyrighted”. He did not, however, claim that copyright subsisted in all musical works, or that COMPASS administered copyright in all musical works.

But such a discussion between a witness who was still testifying, and one who has yet to testify, should not have occurred.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Tau Chye (Lee Brothers) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tony Yeo Soo Mong, Rozalynne Asmali and Loo Fang Hui</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
