<p xmlns="">production of the bill of lading. The respondent applied for summary judgment to claim for

the balance of the purchase price. The appellants in turn applied under O 14 r 12 to

determine whether, in relation to a straight bill of lading, the shipowner may deliver the

goods to the named consignee without production of the bill of lading. The judge below

held that the appellants were not entitled to deliver the cargo to the named consignee

without production of the bill of lading and held the appellants liable in conversion and

damages. The appellants appealed against this decision. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, </p></b>dismissing the appeal: 

<p xmlns="">(1)    While a bill of lading, devoid of the characteristic of

negotiability, is substantially similar to a sea waybill, that is not to say that they are

the same. Whilst one cannot indorse a straight bill to transfer constructive possession of

the cargo, it does not necessarily follow that the straight bill does not impose a

contractual term obligating the carrier to require its production to obtain delivery (see

 48). </p>
<p xmlns="">(2)    The issue must be resolved on the basis of contract law and the

intention of the parties. Clear words must be present to imply that the parties intended

the instrument to be treated, in all respects, as if it were a sea waybill and that its

presentation is not necessary for delivery. The fact that the parties issued the

instrument as a bill of lading must mean that they wished to retain all the other features

of the bill of lading, other than the characteristic of transferability (see  48-50). </p>
<p xmlns="">(3)    From the perspective of the market place, there is much to

commend the rule that presentation of a straight bill of lading is a pre-requisite to

obtaining delivery under it. Such a rule is simple to apply and promotes certainty (see

 51-53). </p>
<p xmlns="">(4)    In respect of a straight bill of lading, the shipowners should

only deliver the cargo against its presentation (see  55).</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1        This

appeal raises a straightforward, but not an easy question relating to the carriage of

goods by sea. The question is whether, in relation to a straight bill of lading (BL),

making the goods deliverable to a specific person as consignee, without words importing

transferability, such as "to XYZ or order", the shipowner may deliver the same

to XYZ without production of the BL. There is no decided case on the point and textbook

writers are not unanimous as to what the correct answer is.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2        The

court below held that the appellant carrier was not entitled to deliver the cargo to the

named consignee without production of the BL. Accordingly, Judith Prakash J held the

appellant-carrier liable in conversion and damages. The appellants, APL Co Pte Lte (APL),

have appealed against the decision.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts </font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3        The

facts of the case are largely undisputed. The respondent shipper, Mr Peer Voss, who

carried on an automobile business in Germany, offered to sell a convertible Mercedes Benz

motocar (model CLK 320) to a Korean company in Seoul, Seohwan Trading Co Ltd (Seohwan), at

a price of DM108,600. A down-payment of DM48,500 was made by Seohwan. Following that

payment, Mr Voss made an arrangement with APL to ship the motorcar on board the vessel

"Hyundai General" from Hamburg to Busan, South Korea. The motorcar was loaded

onto the vessel on 28 August 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4        The

BL issued for the shipment bore the name of the buyer, Seohwan Trading Co Ltd, in the box

entitled "consignee" but without the words "to order". The bill also

provided that:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"A set of three originals of

    this bill of lading is hereby issued by the carrier. Upon surrender to the carrier of any

    one negotiable bill of lading, properly endorsed, all others shall stand void."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5        The

three sets of the original BL issued in respect of the shipment were at all times held by

Mr Voss, because the buyer had yet to pay Mr Voss for the remainder of the purchase price.

The only disputed point of fact was whether Mr Voss had already been paid by the buyer.

APL asserted that the payment had been made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6        Soon

after the vessel arrived at its destination, APL’s office at Busan released the

motorcar to Seohwan without the production of any of the three sets of the BL. In making

the delivery, APL relied upon two documents furnished by Seohwan. The first was a copy of

Mr Voss’ invoice for the balance sum. The second was a copy of an outgoing cable from

the Korean Exchange Bank to a bank in Frankfurt showing a remittance of DM207,500,

purportedly as payment for the motorcar and another transaction between the parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7        In

November 2000 Mr Voss wrote to Seohwan demanding payment of the balance sum. No reply was

received. As the balance of the purchase price of the motorcar was still not paid by mid

December 2000, Mr Voss demanded payment of the same from APL. APL rejected the claim on

the ground that they were not wrong to have delivered the motorcar to Seohwan without the

production of the BL.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8        The

present action instituted by Mr Voss against APL was to claim for the loss of the balance

of the purchase price. Mr Voss applied for summary judgment and APL, in turn, applied

under O.14 r 12 for the determination of the question of law set out in the opening

paragraph of this judgment.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Classification of bills of lading</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9        A

bill making goods deliverable "to XYZ or order" is an order bill. A bill making

goods deliverable "to XYZ" and nothing more, means that the goods can only be

delivered to XYZ and no one else. XYZ will not have the option of transferring it to

another person. This second kind of bill is known as a "straight" bill or a

"non-order" bill. There is, in fact, a third type of bill known as the

"bearer" bill, which will allow delivery to be made to whomsoever holds the

bill. A "bearer" bill can arise in the following circumstances:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)    if the bill

    explicitly so declares itself to be one;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)    if the

    name of the consignee is stated as "bearer";</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii)    if it is

    an order bill but does not mention to whose order it is; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv)    if it is

    an order bill endorsed in blank by the person named in the order bill.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(see <i>Tetley on Marine Cargo

    Claims, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn</i> at 182-3).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10        An

order bill is often loosely described as "negotiable". But this word does not

have the same meaning as it bears in relation to a bill of exchange. The description

"negotiable" simply means the bill is transferable; it does not give to the

transferee a better title than what the transferor possesses. It is not in dispute that

the present BL is a straight bill or a non-order bill.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11        It

is trite law that under a BL, which is usually an order bill and is negotiable, the

carrier is under the obligation to deliver the cargo at the port of destination to the

holder of the bill, upon presentation of and under the terms found in the bill itself. If

the cargo is delivered to someone who does not present the original bill of lading, even

if the person is the named consignee, the carrier will be held answerable for the tort of

conversion. In <i>Skibsaktieselskapet Thor v Tyrer</i> (1929) 35 L. IL. R163 at 170,

Wright J said, </font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"It is perfectly clear law

    that a shipowner who delivers without production of the bill of lading does so at his

    peril."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12        In <i>Sze

Hai Tong Bank v Rambler Cycle Co</i> [1959] AC 576 at 586, the Privy Council held such a

delivery to be in breach of contract. Lord Denning said (at p.586):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is perfectly clear that a

    shipowner who delivers without production of the bill of lading does so at his peril. The

    contract is to deliver, on production of the bill of lading, to the person entitled under

    the bill of lading. … The shipping company did not deliver the goods to any such

    person. They are therefore liable for breach of contract unless there is some term in the

    bill of lading protecting them. And they delivered the goods, without production of the

    bill of lading, to a person who was not entitled to receive them. They are, therefore,

    liable in conversion unless likewise protected."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But we hasten to add that in <i>Sze

Hai Tong Bank</i> the court was clearly dealing with a negotiable bill, as it was stated

to be "unto order or his or their assigns".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13        In <i>Glyn

Mills, Currie &amp; Co v East &amp; West India Dock</i> (1882) 7 App Cas 591 at 610, Lord

Blackburn said that a carrier delivering the goods without the bill of lading being

produced would be in breach of the contract. Although there did not appear to be any

evidence that the bill in issue contained a clause requiring it to be produced, his

Lordship seemed to have implied such a term.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Appellants’ arguments</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14        The

argument raised by the appellants is that as a straight BL is non-negotiable, and being

unendorseable to a third party, it is to be equated to a sea waybill whose essential

characteristic is also that of non-negotiability.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15        As

far as a sea waybill is concerned, it is settled law that the obligation of the carrier is

to deliver the cargo to the named consignee provided that the latter can prove his

identity; there is no requirement that the consignee must present the waybill before he

can obtain delivery of the goods: see <i>Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading

(20<sup>th</sup> Edn 1996)</i> at 39.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16        The

advantage of resorting to a sea waybill is that it avoids the problems arising from the

late arrival of the documentation; its contents can be telexed to the destination. Sea

waybills are often used in trades involving short sea voyages, where the carrying ship may

arrive at its destination before the shipping documents do.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Appellants’ authorities</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        In

support of the proposition which the appellants have advanced, they cited a number of

recent authorities. But we must add that in none of them was the <i>ratio decidendi</i> on

point. Furthermore, reliance is also placed on the views expressed in two works, <i>Benjamin’s

Sale of Goods (5<sup>th</sup> Edn)</i> and <i>Carver on Bill of Lading (1<sup>st</sup>

Edn).</i> But it must be noted that the relevant chapters in these two works were authored

by the same writer, Prof Guenter Treitel. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18        It

may be expedient if we should at this juncture set out the views expressed in those two

works. In <i>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</i> <i>(5<sup>th</sup> Edn)</i> at 18-014 it

is stated that –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Two things follow from the fact

    that a document of this kind is not transferable by indorsement and delivery. First, the

    consignee (if in possession of the document) cannot, by purporting to transfer it in this

    way, impose on the carrier a legal obligation to deliver the goods to another person.

    Secondly, the shipper cannot oblige the carrier to deliver the goods to a different

    consignee from the one named merely by indorsing and delivering the bill to that other

    person; <u>for under a straight bill the carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the

    goods to the originally named consignee without production of the bill,</u> so that, when

    he delivers the goods, he may have no means of knowing of the purported transfer of the

    bill. This difficulty cannot arise in the case of an order bill, under which the goods are

    deliverable only on production of the bill." (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19        In <i>Carver

on Bills of Lading</i>, a similar view is propounded at 6-007 –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A "straight" bill is

    not a document of title in the common law sense, so that its transfer does not operate as

    a transfer of the constructive possession of the goods. <u>It is not a symbol of the goods

    because the carrier is entitled and bound to deliver the goods to the named consignee

    without production of the bill</u>. It follows that a carriage document will not be a

    document of title in the common law sense if it is expressed on its face to be "non

    negotiable". Sea waybills have the legal nature of "straight" or

    "non-negotiable" bills: they are similarly not documents of title in the common

    law sense, since under such waybills delivery is to be made to the named consignee,

    irrespective of production of the waybill, and not to the holder of the waybill as such.

    (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20        

Furthermore, while <i>Carver on Bills of Lading </i>in paragraphs 1-007 and 1-008, also

states that there is no difference between sea waybill and a ‘straight’ or

‘non-negotiable’ BL, the authors seem to imply that that is so only in the

context of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Acts (COGSA) of 1971 and 1992 and this appears

from the following passage:- </font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"One possible view is that

    the definitions in this Act assume that it is <i>only</i> an order (or a bearer) bill

    which is a "bill of lading," so that a document making goods deliverable to an

    identified person (and not to his order) is not a bill of lading at all. This may, indeed,

    be the position for the purposes of the 1992 Act, and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act

    1971, while not using the expression "sea waybill" also contrasts bills of

    lading with "non-negotiable" receipts containing or evidencing contracts for the

    carriage of goods by sea. But it does not follow that sea waybills or similar

    non-transferable documents cannot be bills of lading for any legal purposes whatsoever. <u>The

    definitions and distinctions just quoted apply only for the purposes of the Acts in which

    they occur and not for the purposes of other legislation or of rules of common law or

    where a question arises as to the meaning of the phrase "bill of lading" in a

    contract.</u> For example, the fact that a document which has the characteristics of a sea

    waybill (and is therefore not a bill of lading) for the purposes of the Carriage of Goods

    by Sea Act 1992 does not preclude the possibility of such a document’s being regarded

    as a "bill of lading" for the purposes of section 1(4) of the Factors Act 1889

    and hence of the Sales of Goods Act 1979." (Emphasis added).</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"With respect to a

    non-negotiable bill, the position is the same in England and America; the carrier need not

    require that it be produced or surrendered and need not even see the bill. All that is

    in the bill as the consignee."</font></p>

Turning now to the cases relied upon by the appellants, the first is <i>The Chitral</i>

[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 529 where the question before the court was, who had the title

to sue in relation to the cargo carried on board <i>"The Chitral"</i> from

Bremen to Dubai and which cargo was damaged during carriage. The judge, David Steel J,

could not accept the argument that the bill in question, where the printed box for naming

of the consignee (headed "if order state notify party") was left blank was an

"order" bill. The case had nothing to do with the question under consideration

in this judgment. It did not deal with the delivery obligation of the carrier.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23        Next

is <i>The River Ngada</i> [2001] LMLN 570 where again the issue was whether the claimant

had the title to sue in respect of the damage caused to the cargo. There, the Deputy Judge

opined that in a straight BL, the production of the BL by the named consignee was not a

necessary pre-condition for delivery. In coming to this view, the Deputy Judge relied upon

the passage in <i>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</i> at 18-014, which we have quoted

above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24        The

more recent case, <i>The Rafaela S</i> [2002] EWHC 593 was also not concerned with the

question whether in a straight BL the shipowner/charterer could deliver the cargo to the

specified consignee without the production of the BL. The issue there was whether the

shipowner/charterer could rely on the limitation prescribed under the <i>United States

Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1936</i> or the more generous regime of <i>Hague </i>or <i>Hague-Visby

Rules</i> which had been enacted in the UK <i>Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971.</i> To

determine this question, it was necessary to decide whether the straight BL issued by the

shipowner/charterer was a BL within the meaning of s.1(4) of the 1971 Act, which provided

that –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"nothing in this section

    shall be taken as applying anything in the Rules to any contract for the carriage of goods

    lading or any similar document of title."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25        The

1971 Act did not define a "bill of lading". There, Mr Justice Langley held that

a straight BL which was not negotiable was not a "document of title". He was of

the view that the definition of a BL included "the characteristics of transferability

of title to the goods" and relied for this proposition on <i>Scrutton on

Charterparties, 20<sup>th</sup> Edn, Article 2</i> pages 1-2, <i>Benjamin’s Sale of

Goods, 5<sup>th</sup> Edn, </i><i>18-007 </i>and<i> Carver on Bills of Lading 1<sup>st</sup>

Edn </i>6-007 and 6-014. He accordingly held that a straight BL did not fall within

the 1971 Act. However, Langley J went further to express the view (obiter) that, <i>while

the point was of some nicety,</i> it was not necessary in respect of a straight BL that

delivery must be against the BL.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26        In <i>The

Brij</i> [2001] 1 Lloyd Rep 431, the Hong Kong High Court, relying solely on <i>Benjamin

on Sale of Goods</i>, held that in the case of a straight BL, the carrier could deliver

directly to the specified consignee without the production of the BL. The substantive

issue in the case would appear to relate to the question of privity of contract.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Respondent’s contention</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27        On

the other hand, the respondent contends that a straight BL, while it shares the

characteristic of non-transferability with a sea waybill, is nevertheless not a sea

waybill. The respondent relies upon a number of leading cases on the subject to

substantiate his argument that production of the BL is vital to obtaining delivery,

irrespective of whether it is a straight or an order bill. However, like the cases relied

on by the appellants, those cited by the respondent also do not contain a ratio to that

effect. This was because they did not address, nor was it necessary to address, the

specific issue, that in respect of a straight BL, the carrier could deliver to the named

consignee without its production.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28        In

the celebrated case, <i>The Stettin</i> (1889) 14PD 142, Butt J held that a shipowner was

not entitled to deliver the goods to the consignee named in the BL without the production

of the bill and that the shipowner who so delivered must bear the consequences. But the

fact remains that the case itself was concerned with a negotiable bill which specified

that the goods were "to be delivered to the consignee named in the BL or to his

assigns". While it is true that the distinction between a straight and negotiable

bill was raised in argument, Butt J did not specifically refer to it in his judgment.

Arguably, it could be inferred that Butt J did not think that the distinction was relevant

as far as the delivery obligation of the carrier was concerned.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29        In

an earlier case, <i>Henderson &amp; Co v The Comptoir d’Escompte de Paris</i>

(1873-4) LR 5 PC 253, the Privy Council (PC) assumed that where a BL did not include the

words "or order or assigns", it was not a negotiable document. The PC held that,

while the absence of those words in a BL was unusual, that would not suffice to put a man

of business, or a bank, on inquiry into the nature of the special arrangement. It did not

constitute constructive knowledge. It seems to us that apart from the fact that it decided

that a straight BL was not transferable, nothing more should be read into it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30        In<i>

Thrige v United Shipping Co Ltd </i>[1924] Lloyd’s Rep 6 where it was unnecessary to

decide the question whether, where a BL was made out to a consignee and the property

passes on shipment, the shipowner who delivered to the named consignee without production

of the BL was or was not liable for breach of contract, Scrutton LJ stated that if <i>Stettin</i>

had decided that there was such a duty, he thought <i>Stettin</i> might require further

consideration. He also declined to express a view whether such a BL was or was not a

negotiable instrument. </font></p>

        Barclays Bank Ltd v Commissioners of Customs

&amp; Excise</i> [1963] 1 Lloyd Rep 81 involved a negotiable BL as goods were shipped

under the BL to "order of the shipper". To that extent, the point may be made

that the following general statement of Diplock LJ should be viewed with some

circumspection –</font>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"So long as the contract is

    not discharged the bill of lading, in my view, remains a document of title by indorsement

    and delivery of which the rights of property in the goods can be transferred. It is clear

    law that where a bill of lading or order is issued in respect of the contract of carriage

    by sea, the shipowner is not bound to surrender possession of the goods to any person

    whether named as consignee or not, except on production of the bill of lading …"</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is difficult to say whether in

that pronouncement, Diplock LJ also had in mind a straight BL, where words such as

"to order" were absent.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32        In <i>The

Houda</i> [1994] 2 Lloyds 541, there was a shipment in August 1990 of a cargo of crude oil

by a time-charterer from Kuwait shortly before the invasion of that country by Iraq. The

BLs were left by the master in Kuwait and were never seen. After the invasion, the

management of the charterers moved to London where the charterers gave orders relating to

the voyage of the vessel. Eventually, a settlement was reached and the cargo was

discharged. The charterer sued for the loss of services of the <i>Houda </i>for a period

of some 36 days. One of the questions which the court was asked to address was whether the

owner was obliged to deliver without the production of the BLs and it held that the owner

was not so obliged. But again we recognised that the BLs which the charterers instructed

the shipowners to issue were negotiable.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33        In <i>Evans

&amp; Reid v "Cornouaille"</i> [1921] Lloyd’s Rep 76, which also concerned

an "order" BL, and where the shipowner parted with the cargo without the

production of the BL, Hill J said (at p.77):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The fact that the coal was

    intended to be delivered to the Societe Union did not entitle the Master to deliver to

    anybody without production of the Bill of Lading. It would not have entitled him to

    deliver even if the Societe Union had been the consignee named in the Bill of Lading. It

    is said that the plaintiffs ought to have informed the defendants that the buyers of the

    coal had not taken up the documents. There is no such duty upon the plaintiffs. The

    transaction between the buyers and the plaintiffs had nothing to do with the shipowners.

    The latter were only concerned with the fulfillment of their Bill of Lading contract, and

    the plaintiffs were entitled to rely upon this, that the ship would not give delivery of

    the goods until the Bill of Lading, with the plaintiffs’ endorsement upon it, was

    presented to the Master.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34        We

now turn to the views of textbook writers. As indicated before, not all writers hold the

chapters in both <i>Benjamin</i> and <i>Carver</i> were written by the same author.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35        In

contrast, in<i> Schmitthoff’s The Law and Practice of International Trade (10<sup>th</sup>

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A shipper who wishes to obtain a

    bill of lading which is not negotiable does not insert the word "order" in the

    appropriate box of the bill but inserts the name of the consignee in the following box.

    The effect of this procedure is that, although the shipper can transfer title in the goods

    to the consignee by delivering the bill of lading to him, the consignee cannot further

    pass on title in them to a third party by transfer of the BL.</font></p>

    produce the bill of lading.</font></p></u> However, a great practical value of the bill of lading as

    a means of making goods in transit rapidly transferable is due to the customary

    function as a document of title. (Emphasis added).

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36        In <i>Paul

Todd’s Bill of Lading and Bankers’Documentary Credits (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition)</i>

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"If a bill of lading is

    issued, the carrier must deliver only upon tender of an original bill of lading at the

    he alone may validly present it to obtain goods from the vessel. </u>Alternatively, it may

    be made negotiable … Because delivery of the goods can be made only against

    presentation of an original bill of lading, it follows that transfer of the document can

    also transfer the right to take possession of the goods on discharge. Hence, the bill of

    lading is said to be a ‘document of title’, representing the goods while they

    are goods on sea."</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">a U.S. straight bill of lading (a

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38        It

<i xmlns="">
<p></p></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">40<i>

        Gaskell on Bills of Lading: Law and Contracts</i>,

which was cited by the appellants, notes that a straight BL "is probably little more

than a waybill by another name" (at para 1.49). It goes on to observe that

"there are doubts if a carrier would get a good discharge for delivery without

production of a (straight) bill of lading in English law." Then at para 14.24 the

author states "it is unclear whether a carrier is obliged to deliver to the consignee

named in a … straight bill, even without production of that bill" and against

this statement there is a footnote which states "… the US legal position is that

a straight bill does not have to be presented, but that general practice elsewhere is to

require a straight bill to be surrendered, rather like an order bill." This is in

line with the comment of <i>Tetley</i> at p.232 where it is stated that sea waybill are

called "straight bills of lading in the US." </font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41        

Finally, at para 14.25, having reviewed the different opinions on the matter, the author

came to the conclusion that "the view of <i>Benjamin</i> is to be preferred, on the

basis that there is no real distinction between a waybill and a straight bill, and that

neither are needed to obtain delivery of the goods (unless the contract so

requires)." But rather interestingly, the author goes on to explain that (also at

para 14.25):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In practice, most of the standard

    form bills (which are mainly designed to be negotiable) do contain express terms which

    singly or together provide that a bill is to be surrendered before goods will be

    delivered. There is no apparent distinction, as a matter of construction, between cases

    where the bill is made out to order and when it is consigned "straight" to a

    named consignee. Thus, the express terms on the surrender of bills such as Conlinebill or

    the P&amp;O Nedlloyd Bill state that "an original bill of lading, duly endorsed, <i>must</i>

    be surrendered …" This clause is to be found on the face of most bills. <u>It

    might be said that the reference to "duly endorsed" indicates that the term only

    applies to negotiable and not straight bills. The better view is probably that the carrier

    is only requiring that any bill presented should apparently entitle the holder to claim

    delivery (as with a bearer bill), so there is no reason to restrict the application of the

    clause to negotiable bills when it is well known that the forms could easily be used as

    non-negotiable documents, e.g., straight consigned bills.</u> (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42        What

is clear from <i>Gaskell</i> is that the views offered by the author are rather equivocal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43        We

must observe that while the BL issued in the present case does not have a clause with the

identical words "an original bill of lading, duly endorsed, must be

surrendered", it contained somewhat similar words "upon surrender to the Carrier

of any one negotiable bill of lading, properly endorsed, all others shall stand

void." The reasoning of <i>Gaskell</i> on the expression "duly endorsed"

can similarly be applied to the expression "properly endorsed" which is found in

the present BL.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44        We

now turn to <i>Charles Debattista’s The Sale of Goods Carried by Sea (2<sup>nd</sup>

Ed)</i> at para 2-32 where he refrains from stating the law definitively and instead

opines that "given the guidance given by the Law Commissions in their Report

accompanying COGSA 1992, it is extremely likely that the courts will regard non-order

bills as sea waybills." Debattista’s observations are revealing in its heavy

reliance on COGSA but overlooked the fact that while the English and Scottish Commissions

in their report on <i>Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea</i>, had

observed that the straight BLs and the sea waybills are much the same type of document,

they added the qualification, <i>"save that the sea waybill is not required to obtain

delivery." </i>In short, while the two Commissions accepted that a straight BL and a

sea waybill are very similar documents, they are not identical and that the production of

a straight BL is necessary to obtain delivery.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45        It

is of interest to note that in <i>The Happy Ranger</i> [2002] EWCA Civ 694, while the

Court of Appeal held that the bill in question was not a "straight" BL,

nevertheless two Lord Justices, Tuckey and Rix, expressly made the observation that the

views of textbook writers that the production of a straight BL was not necessary for

delivery, referring no doubt to <i>Benjamin </i>and<i> Carver</i>, were not necessarily

correct. Even the third member of the quorum, Aldous LJ, would appear to agree with that

reservation because he adopted the judgment of Tuckey LJ.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46        The

only Singapore case which had the occasion to consider the issue was <i>Olivine

Electronics Pte Ltd v Seabridge Transport Pte</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9467&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 143</a>. There the seller of

320 coloured television sets shipped them on board a vessel. The BL stated the buyer as

the consignee and notifying party. The shipowner delivered the goods to the buyer without

presentation of the BL. As the seller did not receive payment for the same, he instituted

an action for conversion to recover the loss from the defendant shipowner for releasing

the goods without the production of the BL. The defendant argued that as this was a

straight bill, and not a document of title, and as it was similar to a sea waybill, its

production was not needed to obtain delivery. Goh Joon Seng J, applying the <i>contra

proferentum r</i>ule, held that it was a term of the contract that delivery must be

against the presentation of the BL. Thus it was unnecessary for the court to answer the

more general question. However, the judge did remark that the law on the duty on the part

of the carrier to deliver only against production of the original BL in a straight

consigned BL was still "somewhat open".</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our Opinion</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47        It

seems to us that some of the confusion in this area of the law could perhaps have been

caused by a misunderstanding of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 (COGSA 1992), which

requires a bill to be transferable before it is a bill of lading for the purposes of the

Act. Indeed, that was also the position under COGSA 1971. The Act is only concerned with

rights of suit in respect of carriage of goods by sea. It does not, in any way, deal with

the question whether presentation of a straight bill is necessary to obtain delivery. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48        At

the end of the day, it seems to us that the issue must be resolved on the basis of

contract law and the intention of the parties. The entire argument of the appellants is

that a straight BL is the same as a sea waybill. While it is true that a BL, devoid of the

characteristic of negotiability, is substantially similar in effect to that of a sea

waybill, that is not to say that they are the same. If the parties had intended to create

a sea waybill they would have done so. Ordinarily, the main characteristics of a BL are

twofold. First, it is negotiable (i.e., transferable). Second, it is a document of title,

requiring its presentation to obtain delivery of the cargo. In the case of a straight

bill, while the characteristic of transferability is absent, there is no reason why one

should thereby infer that the parties had intended to do away with the other main

characteristic, i.e., delivery upon presentation. As the Judge below noted, while one

cannot indorse a straight bill to transfer constructive possession of the cargo, it does

not necessarily follow that the straight bill does not impose a contractual term

obligating the carrier to require its production to obtain delivery.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49        It

seems to us that clear words must be present to imply that the parties intended the

instrument to be treated, in all respects, as if it were a sea waybill and that its

presentation by the named consignee is not necessary. Indeed, if the parties had wanted to

have a sea waybill they could have quite easily adopted that format. They would not have

issued a BL with three originals. By issuing the instrument as a BL, it must mean that

they wished to retain all the other features of a BL, other than the characteristic of

transferability.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50        

Davies &amp; Dickey on Shipping Law (2<sup>nd</sup> Edn)</font></p></i> states at 163: "if a

negotiable document of title is not needed, the parties <u xmlns="">may</u> choose to use a sea

waybill as the contract of carriage, instead of a bill of lading." Clearly, the

option is with the parties. And if they nevertheless choose to adopt the format of a BL,

the court should not be astute to convert their arrangement into something they do not

want to have in the first place. That is the first point we make.

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51        

Secondly, even looking at the matter from the perspective of the market place, there is

much to commend the rule that even in respect of a straight bill presentation of it is a

pre-requisite to obtaining delivery. If nothing else, the advantage of this rule is that

it is simple to apply. It is certain. It would prevent confusion and avoid the shipowners

and/or their agents having to decide whether a bill is a straight bill or an order bill

[e.g., <i>Happy Ranger</i> (supra)], and run the risk attendant thereto if the

determination they make on that point should turn out to be erroneous. The rule would

obviate such wholly unnecessary litigation. In this connection, we think the following

words of Clarke J in<i> The Sormovskiy 3068 </i>[1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 266 (which

concerned an order bill) have much to commend themselves (at p.274):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"It makes commercial sense

    to have a simple rule that in the absence of an express term of the contract the master

    must only deliver the cargo to the holder of the bill of lading who presents it to him. In

    that way both the shipowners and the persons in truth entitled to possession of the cargo

    are protected by the term of the contract."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52        

Thirdly, to accept the arguments put forward by APL is to envisage two broad categories of

documents which could be used by shippers. The first option is the negotiable BL; in such

a situation, delivery of the goods can only be made upon presentation of the BL. The

second option for shippers is to use a non-negotiable straight BL or sea waybill; here,

the straight BL or waybill need not be produced for delivery of the goods. In essence,

APL’s scheme envisages that as long as the shipping document is non-negotiable on its

face, presentation of the original BL or sea waybill is unnecessary for delivery. We think

that this approach is overly restrictive for an unpaid seller who wishes to use a

non-negotiable BL while retaining his security for payment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53        

Indeed, to hold that a straight BL is not the same as a sea waybill has the advantage of

providing such a seller, or in the case of documentary credit, the bank, with some

security against default by the buyer, and the buyer of some assurance that the seller has

shipped the cargo before he is required to make payment. In short, it gives both the buyer

and the seller, where they, for their own reasons, want only a straight BL be issued, a

fair measure of protection. That was what Mr Voss wanted: payment before delivery by

carrier. In contrast, the sea waybill is only a contract of carriage whereby the carrier

undertakes to deliver the cargo to the person identified by the shipper as entitled to

take delivery of the cargo. The sea waybill is retained by the shipper and all the

consignee need show to take delivery is proof of his identity. It is a receipt, not a

document of title. It, unlike a BL, cannot be used as a security to obtain financing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54        

Fourthly, adopting the rule that presentation of a straight BL is a pre-requisite to

obtaining delivery also avoids the undesirable consequences of the shipper’s rights

of suit under the original contract of carriage surviving any transfer of the document to

the consignee.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Judgment</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55        In

the light of the foregoing, we hold that in respect of a straight BL, the shipowners

should only deliver the cargo against its presentation. In the circumstances, there is no

defence to the respondent’s claim. Some faint attempts were made to raise triable

issues so that the action could go for trial but they are, as found by the judge below,

wholly without merits. The appellants’ defence rests essentially on the legal point

on which they have failed. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the High Court and

dismissed the appeal with costs. The security for costs, together with any accrued

interest, shall be paid out to the respondent’s solicitors to account of the

respondent’s costs.</font></p>
