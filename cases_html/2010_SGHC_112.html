<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the plaintiff’s application for a
                    Mareva injunction against the first, second and fourth defendants’ assets
                    in Singapore. I granted the application on 10 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore on 3 May 2006 and is engaged in the business of distributing
                    scientific and precision equipment for use in the medical and cosmetic surgery
                    market. The third defendant was an administrator with the plaintiff from
                    3 December 2007 to 11 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant was the managing director of
                    the plaintiff from 27 June 2006 to 24 November 2008 and a director of
                    the plaintiff from 27 June 2006 to 13 August 2009. She has been a 48%
                    shareholder of the plaintiff from 24 January 2007. The other 52% of the
                    shares in the plaintiff is held by one Jasmine Goh (“Jasmine”) as
                    nominee for one David Loo (“David”) and one Rosie Tang
                    (“Rosie”). David and Rosie are the founders of the plaintiff.
                    David was concurrently the shareholder and director of another company call
                    Innomed Pte Ltd (“Innomed”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The second defendant is the first
                    defendant’s husband. He worked for the plaintiff as a marketing manager
                    from 23 August 2007 to 30 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant incorporated the fourth
                    defendant on 5 May 2008 and is its sole director and shareholder. The
                    fourth defendant is in the same business as the plaintiff and has signed
                    contracts with the plaintiff’s ex-customers, in particular, one Shin Han
                    Eni (“Shin Han”) and one Sybaritic Inc
                    (“Sybaritic”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The management of the plaintiff’s business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Jasmine was the chairman of the
                    plaintiff’s board of directors. Previously, two signatures were required
                    to operate the plaintiff’s bank account – Jasmine’s and the
                    first defendant’s. In January 2007, Jasmine relocated to France and the
                    signatory to the plaintiff’s bank account was changed so that the first
                    defendant could sign singly without Jasmine. Thereafter, the first defendant was
                    left to run the plaintiff’s business by herself with occasional input from
                    David and Rosie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 27 January 2008, David wrote an e-mail
                    to the first defendant requesting monthly updates on the plaintiff’s bank
                    statements and business activities, as well as quarterly submissions of the
                    plaintiff’s profit and loss statements. The first defendant agreed to this
                    in her reply e-mail of 28 January 2008. However, the plaintiff claims that
                    this was not carried through and that between May and November 2008, the first
                    defendant refused to provide Jasmine, David and Rosie with the plaintiff’s
                    accounts, list of employees and documents concerning the plaintiff’s
                    distributorship agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In January 2008, the plaintiff secured the
                    exclusive right to distribute, in Singapore, Shin Han’s
                    “Eraser-C” and “Co Cell” CO2 laser systems, both of
                    which are used for skin treatment. On 26 June 2008, Sybaritic appointed the
                    plaintiff as the exclusive distributor of “NannoLight” and
                    “TRIO Skin Tightener” machines in Singapore from 1 June 2008
                    to 31 December 2009 with the option to extend to 31 December 2011.
                    Both exclusive distributorship agreements were eventually terminated by Shin Han
                    and Sybaritic.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 681 of 2009/B</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In Suit 681 of 2009/B (“S681”),
                    the plaintiff claims that the first and second defendants have acted dishonestly
                    and in breach of their fiduciary and contractual duties to the plaintiff.
                    Additionally, the plaintiff has brought claims against the first and second
                    defendants for dishonest assistance in breach of each other’s fiduciary
                    duties to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also alleges knowing receipt of the
                    plaintiff’s assets by the second and fourth defendants. It is the
                    plaintiff’s position that the fourth defendant was set up as a vehicle in
                    a scheme hatched by the first and second defendants to divert the
                    plaintiff’s business, customers, suppliers and contracts to the fourth
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff cites, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following allegations to support its claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants dishonestly concealed
                        from David, Rosie and Jasmine the existence of the exclusive
                        distributorships from Shin Han and Sybaritic and the written
                        agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        defendants dishonestly concealed from David, Rosie and Jasmine the
                        resignation of the second defendant, the incorporation of the fourth
                        defendant by the second defendant and the diversion or risk of diversion of
                        the plaintiff’s business and contracts to the fourth
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        defendants dishonestly misappropriated the plaintiff’s exclusive
                        distributorships of Shin Han’s and Sybaritic’s products and
                        diverted them to the fourth defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     In August 2008, the managing director of Sybaritic, one
                        Mr Jory Steinman (“Steinman”) was scheduled to visit the
                        plaintiff. However, the first defendant e-mailed the third defendant on
                        11 August 2008 and instructed her to bring Steinman to the fourth
                        defendant’s office instead of the plaintiff’s office. On
                        21 August 2008, Steinman arrived at the plaintiff’s office and
                        the first and second defendants brought him to the fourth defendant’s
                        office instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff has been distributing products of Medro Medical Division Co
                        Ltd (“Medro Medical”) since March 2007. However, on or about
                        19 August 2008, the first defendant e-mailed Mr John Park of Medro
                        Medical to direct all future purchases to the fourth defendant. The e-mail
                        states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Dear John,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Thank you for accepting my proposal. In future, all buying will be
                            under the new company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Please amend the proforma Invoice to the following address and Company

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">As for right now, we will correspondence thru SpectraMed email but
                            once the NEW Company email posted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Have a Nice evening.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">With Best Regards</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Samantha</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a>(f)     The defendants
                        repeatedly stonewalled David, Rosie and Jasmine when they chased the first
                        defendant for the plaintiff’s accounts, list of employees, customer
                        list, human resource records and details of the plaintiff’s
                        distributorships with Shin Han and Sybaritic.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_g"></a>(g)     From 6 June 2008 to 27 August 2008,
                        the first and second defendants procured the plaintiff to sell some its
                        products to the fourth defendant at prices which were lower than the prices
                        at which the plaintiff had sold the same products to its other customers.
                        The fourth defendant then sold these products to end purchasers at a higher
                        price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_h"></a>(h)     Whilst a
                        N3 licence from the National Environment Agency and approval from the Centre
                        for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science (“CRPNS”) were
                        required for the sale, commissioning and servicing of laser equipment in
                        Singapore, the first and second defendants did not apply for this licence on
                        behalf of the plaintiff. Instead, they applied for the N3 licence and CRPNS
                        approval in the name of the fourth defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_i"></a>(i)     The plaintiff had eight employees in March 2008
                        but this number fell to two by July 2008. The first defendant informed David
                        about this only on 5 September 2008 when she told David that the
                        plaintiff no longer had any employees. The first defendant did not recruit
                        new staff or seek the technical staff that the plaintiff required to provide
                        after sales service. The plaintiff asserts that the first defendant was not
                        interested in recruiting new staff for the plaintiff because she wanted the
                        plaintiff to lose its distributorships to the fourth
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
                        first defendant spent little time at the plaintiff’s office whilst she
                        was still a director of the plaintiff and allowed the third defendant to
                        provide administrative support to the fourth defendant whilst she was still
                        an employee of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_k"></a>(k)     Even after the second defendant had resigned, the first
                        defendant made the plaintiff apply and pay for season parking for the second
                        defendant’s vehicle for 1 July 2008 to 30 September 2008 at
                        the building where the plaintiff’s office was
                located.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendants, on the other hand, claim that,
                    pursuant to an agreement between Rosie and David on the one part and the first
                    defendant on the other part, the plaintiff’s business was to be run by the
                    first defendant without interference from David and Rosie. The plaintiff
                    disputes the existence of such an agreement. The defendants also allege wrongful
                    and oppressive acts of David, Rosie and Jasmine. The defendants submit that
                    David, Rosie and Jasmine were not acting in the best interests of the plaintiff
                    and were instead pursuing their own interests and/or that of Innomed at the
                    expense of the plaintiff. In those circumstances, the defendants claim that the
                    first defendant’s withholding of information from David, Rosie and
                    Jasmine, failure to employ replacement staff for the plaintiff and failure to
                    procure fresh distributorships for the plaintiff were justified. The defendants
                    explain that the sale of the plaintiff’s assets to the fourth defendant
                    and the first defendant’s failure to apply for a N3 licence on behalf of
                    the plaintiff occurred because the plaintiff did not have any technical staff
                    that could provide after-sales services to the plaintiff’s customers.
                    Rather, the defendants claim that the fourth defendant was set up to provide
                    technical after-sales service, repair and maintenance for the plaintiff,
                        <em>i.e. to be the plaintiff’s dealer</em> and
                        <em>not</em> to take over the plaintiff’s
                    business or to compete with the plaintiff. The first defendant has instituted a
                    claim in Suit No 829 of 2009/R against David, Rosie, Jasmine and the
                    plaintiff for, <em>inter alia</em>, minority shareholder
                    oppression and breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application for a Mareva injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the hearing of the application for a Mareva
                    injunction, the plaintiff pointed out that, in addition to the allegations
                    listed above (at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>), on 3 June 2008, the
                    first defendant had made the plaintiff pay for a rubber stamp that the second
                    defendant had made with the fourth defendant’s name. The second
                    defendant’s name on the invoice from the rubber stamp maker was covered up
                    to conceal this fact. The plaintiff submitted that the defendants’
                    repeated instances of fraudulent misappropriation of the plaintiff’s
                    assets demonstrate a lack of probity on the part of the defendants. The
                    plaintiff feared that the defendants would dissipate their assets, particularly
                    the assets of the fourth defendant, in the event that judgment is entered
                    against them in S681. The quantum in respect of which the plaintiff sought a
                    Mareva injunction was a sum of S$2,013,229. This amount is the plaintiff’s
                    estimate of what would be awarded to it if an account of the defendants’
                    profits and damages to be paid by the defendants are ordered in
                S681.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendants pointed out that they have done
                    nothing to dissipate their assets since the hearing of plaintiff’s
                    application for an <em>ex parte</em> Mareva injunction on
                    25 August 2009 and submitted that this shows that the defendants do not
                    have the disposition or propensity to dissipate their assets. Moreover, the
                    defendants claimed that the plaintiff had not established a good arguable case
                    against them. The defendants argued that their alleged wrongful acts must be
                    viewed in context. The defendants claimed that the first defendant was
                    justified, and had acted <em>bona fide</em>, in not taking
                    on fresh distributorships and hiring new staff for the plaintiff in view of the
                    uncertainty of the future of the plaintiff’s business arising from the
                    alleged oppressive conduct of David, Rosie and Jasmine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     To successfully apply for a Mareva injunction,
                    the plaintiff must show:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a valid cause of action over which the court has
                            jurisdiction;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a good arguable case;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the defendant has assets within or outside
                            the jurisdiction; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a real risk of the assets being disposed of or
                            dissipated so that any judgment which the plaintiff may obtain cannot be
                            enforced.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">(<em>Bahtera Offshore (M) Sdn Bhd v Sim Kok Beng and
                        Another</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 365 at [13])</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I found that the plaintiff has a valid cause
                    of action and a good arguable case. I was also satisfied that the defendants
                    have assets which can be the subject of a Mareva injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The main issue in the present case was whether
                    there was a real risk of dissipation of assets by the defendants. The test is
                    whether “the refusal of a Mareva injunction would involve a real risk
                    that a judgment or award in favour of the plaintiffs would remain
                    unsatisfied” (<em>Ninemia Maritime Corporation v Trave
                        Schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbH (The Niedersachsen)</em> [1984] 1 All
                    ER 398 at 419, quoted with approval in <em>Guan Chong Cocoa
                        Manufacturer Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 157 at [17]). The test is an objective one and there is no
                    need to show an intention to dissipate assets. However, a mere possibility or
                    unsupported fear of dissipation is insufficient and what is required is
                    “solid evidence” of a risk of dissipation of assets (<em>Choy Chee Keen Collin v Public Utilities Board</em> [1996]
                    3 SLR(R) 812). This “solid evidence” may take a number
                    of forms. As illustrated by Mustill J, whose judgment at first instance was
                    upheld on appeal in <em>The Niedersachsen</em> [1983]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 600 at 606-7:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not enough for the plaintiff to assert a risk that the assets will
                        be dissipated. He must demonstrate this by solid evidence. This evidence may
                        take a number of different forms. It may consist of direct evidence that
                            <em>the defendant has previously acted in a way which
                            shows that his probity is not to be relied on</em>. Or the
                        plaintiff may show what type of company the defendant is (where it is
                        incorporated, what are its corporate structure and assets, and so on) so as
                        to raise an inference that the company is not to be relied on. Or again, the
                        plaintiff may be able to found his case on the fact that inquiries about the
                        characteristics of the defendant have led to a blank wall. Precisely what
                        form the evidence may take will depend on the particular circumstances of
                        the case. But the evidence must always be there. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendants in <em>Multi-Code Electronics Industries (M) Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon
                        and others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1000 (“<em>Multi-Code</em>”) were alleged, in the main suit, to
                    have conspired to defraud the plaintiffs. A Mareva injunction was granted as
                    against the defendants and they applied for the discharge of the injunction.
                    Having examined the documentary evidence, the court found, in that case, that
                    the plaintiffs clearly had more than an arguable case against the first and
                    fourth defendants. The probity, honesty and integrity of the first and fourth
                    defendants in <em>Multi-Code</em>, their trustworthiness
                    and reliability to engage in fair dealing had been called into question by the
                    claim against them based on their participation in a conspiracy to defraud such
                    that the risk of dissipation of assets was no longer in the realm of mere
                    possibility or imagination but was very real. On the special facts of <em>Multi-Code</em>, the court refused to lift the Mareva
                    injunction as there was a real risk of dissipation of assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In <em>Patterson v BTR
                        Engineering (Aust) Ltd and others</em> (1989) 18 NSWLR 319,
                    the New South Wales Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal to set aside a Mareva
                    injunction in circumstances where the respondent had alleged that the appellant
                    had interposed a private company (which was controlled by the appellant) between
                    the respondent and certain overseas suppliers, fraudulently procured the
                    overpayment by the respondent for equipment purchases and derived secret profits
                    from those transactions. The court dismissed the application to set aside the
                    Mareva injunction on the ground that the evidence as to the nature of the scheme
                    in which the appellant was allegedly involved established a prima facie case
                    against him such as to justify the conclusion that there was a danger that the
                    appellant would dispose of assets in order to defeat any judgment that might be
                    obtained against him and that such danger was sufficiently substantial to
                    warrant the injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     From the cases cited above, it is clear that
                    allegations of dishonesty are relevant to the issue of whether there is a risk
                    of dissipation of assets. If there is a <em>good arguable
                        case</em> in support of an <em>allegation</em>
                    that the <em>defendant has acted fraudulently, dishonestly or
                        unconscionably</em>, it is <em>unnecessary for there to
                        be any further specific evidence on risk of dissipation</em> for the
                    court to be entitled to take the view that there is a sufficient risk to justify
                    granting Mareva relief (see Stephen Gee, <em>Mareva Injunctions
                        and Anton Piller Relief</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        4<sup>th</sup> ed, 1998 (“Stephen Gee”) at
                    198).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I found that, in the present case, the
                    plaintiff has established a prima facie case in S681, that the defendants have
                    dishonestly misappropriated the plaintiff’s assets such that a risk of
                    dissipation of assets by the defendants existed and this warranted the grant of
                    a Mareva injunction over the defendants’ assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In deciding whether there is a real risk of
                    dissipation of assets, the court may also consider the nature of the
                    defendant’s assets and whether such assets are easily moved (Stephen Gee
                    at 195). I asked the defendants to furnish evidence as to the type of assets
                    they hold. Apart from two motor vehicles, a HDB flat and the fourth defendant
                    company itself (which the defendants submitted has an annual turnover of S$1
                    million), the defendants’ remaining assets consist of monies in bank
                    accounts and unit trusts. These are assets that can be easily moved. Moreover,
                    the plaintiff submitted that there is a possibility that the defendants would
                    transfer the distributorships and goodwill of the fourth defendant to another
                    company, in the same manner as they are alleged in S681 to have done to the
                    plaintiff’s business. Whilst the defendants pointed out that no
                    dissipation of assets has occurred since August 2009, I noted that this was
                    pursuant to an undertaking that the first,<sup></sup>second and fourth defendants had given to the court at the hearing
                    on 25 August 2009 not to dissipate assets pending the disposal of the
                    plaintiff’s application for a Mareva injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Accordingly, I granted the Mareva injunction
                    against the first,<sup></sup>second and fourth defendants on their assets, whether in their
                    respective own names or not and whether solely or jointly owned, up to the value
                    of S$600,000. The first and second defendants are not prohibited from spending
                    S$750 a week each towards their ordinary living expenses and incurring
                    reasonable legal fees on legal advice and representation. Before spending any
                    money exceeding $1,500 on an item, the first andsecond defendants must state to
                    the plaintiff’s solicitors in writing where the source of money is to come
                    from. The fourth defendant is not prohibited from dealing with or disposing of
                    any of its assets in the ordinary and proper course of business provided that
                    the fourth defendant shall account to the plaintiff every first day of the month
                    for the amount of money spent in this regard. Costs were ordered to be in the
                    cause.</p>
