<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On
20 September 2011, Wang Wenfeng (“Wang”) was convicted of murder
under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code
(Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). At the time of the conviction, the offence
was punishable with a mandatory death penalty under s 302 of the
Penal Code. Wang appealed, but the Court of Appeal (“CA”) upheld
the conviction and sentence. On 1 January 2013, the Penal Code (Amendment)
Act 2012 (Act No 32 of 2012) came into operation, with the effect
that the death sentence is no longer mandatory under s 300(<em>b</em>), (<em>c</em>)
and (<em>d</em>) of the Penal Code. Consequently,
on 16 August 2013, the CA remitted the case back to the High Court
for re-sentencing and, on 13 November 2013, I exercised my power
under s 4(5)(<em>g</em>) of the Penal Code
(Amendment) Act 2012 to re-sentence Wang to imprisonment for life
and to 24 strokes of the cane. The prosecution has filed an appeal
against the sentence and I now give the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
full facts of this case are set out in my judgment delivered at
the end of the trial in <em>Public Prosecutor v
Wang Wenfeng</em> [2011] SGHC 208 (“HC Judgment”), as well
as in the grounds of decision of the appeal in <em>Wang
Wenfeng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 4 SLR 590; [2012]
SGCA 47 (“CA Judgment”). I shall therefore set out only the salient
facts below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Wang
is from Fujian Province in the People’s Republic of China. He came
to Singapore to work, but at the time of the offence in April 2009,
he was out of work and was required to leave Singapore by 15 April 2009.
At that time, he could not afford a plane ticket home. He tried
to borrow money from his younger sister and his wife but they did
not lend him any. On Friday 10 April 2009, Wang decided to resort
to robbery to get the money for his airfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In
the early morning of 11 April 2009, Wang set off to Sun Plaza at Sembawang
Drive, carrying with him a haversack containing a fruit knife, a pair
of cotton gloves and a small bottle of water. He thought that taxi drivers
would be good targets, so he flagged down a taxi. It was driven
by the deceased, Yuen Swee Hong (“the Victim”). Wang directed the
Victim to drive to “Bao Ping Chun” and, as they neared the destination,
he directed the Victim to Jalan Selimang. When the taxi stopped
at the end of Jalan Selimang, Wang had already put on his gloves
and taken out his knife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Wang
used his left hand to hold the knife against the Victim’s chest and
his right hand to hold onto the backrest of the driver’s seat. He
told the Victim to hand over his money. A struggle ensued between
Wang and the Victim and, in the course of the struggle, Wang stabbed
the Victim on his chest. The Court of Appeal (“CA”) found that the
Victim was stabbed at least five times (CA Judgment at [36], [38]).
The injuries inflicted on the Victim were severe enough to have
caused heavy bleeding (HC Judgment at [24]) such that, within two
minutes, the struggle ceased and the Victim went limp. This led
Wang to believe that the Victim had died. He decided to hide the
body in the secondary jungle nearby. After carrying the body to
a location well inside the jungle, Wang searched the Victim’s pockets
and took the money he found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Wang
subsequently washed himself at a nearby beach and drove the taxi
to a multi-storey car park at Canberra Road. He parked the taxi
at one of the higher levels. Using the water he brought, he cleaned
away the blood from part of the front cabin. He also cut the cables
connecting the credit card machine which he thought was a Global
Positioning System (“GPS”), took money and the Victim’s mobile phone
from the taxi, cleaned the door handle, and left for home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime
later on the same day, Wang went out to dispose of the incriminating
items, such as the soiled clothes he had worn. He left the haversack
containing these items in a forested area near Nee Soon Road. As he
was journeying on a bus, he received a missed call from the Victim’s
wife on the Victim’s mobile phone. He alighted and returned a call
to the Victim’s wife. He told the Victim’s wife that he was holding
the Victim captive and demanded $150,000 from her. Over the course
of two days, from 11 April 2009 to 12 April 2009, Wang gave instructions
to the Victim’s wife to make payment. When she still did not remit
the money to the account number he provided, he reminded her that
the Victim had not eaten for two days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Meanwhile,
Wang had secured a place on a flight departing on 14 April 2009.
But before he could leave the country, he was arrested by the police
on 13 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Indian courts adopt the position that the default punishment for murder
is life imprisonment and that the death penalty is an exception
(see <em>Bachan Singh v State of Punjab</em> AIR
1980 SC 898 at [151]). This, the prosecution submitted, was untenable
in Singapore for two reasons. First, the legislative framework in
India is different. There is no mandatory death penalty for s 300
cases in India, whereas the death penalty is still mandatory for
s 300(<em>a</em>) cases in Singapore. Secondly,
there is considerable uncertainty in India on the punishment to
be ordered in capital offences (see <em>Sangeet and
another v State of Haryana</em> AIR 2013 SC 447 at [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
prosecution thus submitted that where the law, in this case, s 300(<em>c</em>), provides for a discretionary death
penalty, neither life imprisonment nor the death penalty should
be viewed as the default position. The correct approach is to consider
all the facts and circumstances to determine if the offender ought
to suffer the death penalty (see <em>Sia Ah Kew
and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 54
(“<em>Sia Ah Kew</em>”) at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     
          <em>Sia Ah Kew</em> is a case of kidnapping under
s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Rev Ed). The CA in that
case similarly faced the binary choice of death or life imprisonment,
and had opined that the maximum sentence of death penalty would
be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or
conduct of the kidnappers were such as to <em>outrage the
feelings of the community</em> (at [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
prosecution also referred the court to the Parliamentary speech by
the Minister for Law when introducing the amendments to the mandatory
death penalty regime (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report</em> (9 July 2012) vol 89):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In deciding whether and how to apply the
death penalty to a particular offence, several factors have to be
considered. In particular … three interconnected factors: (1) <em>the seriousness of the offence</em>, both in
terms of the harm that the commission of the offence is likely to
cause to the victim and to society, and the personal culpability
of the accused; (2) <em>how frequent or widespread
an </em><em>offence</em> is; and (3) <em>deterrence</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Each
of the factors was analysed by the prosecution in light of the facts
of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In
terms of the <em>seriousness of the offence</em>,
the prosecution submitted on three main aspects. First, the offence
was committed in a cruel manner. The prosecution argued that there
was a high degree of premeditation and planning, which was demonstrated
by Wang’s intention to commit robbery at the wee hours of the morning,
his preparation of items such as a knife, spare change of clothes
and a water bottle, his deliberate choice of victim (a taxi driver),
and his direction to the Victim to drive to a deserted area (“Bao Ping
Chun”). The prosecution further pointed to the way Wang had armed himself
with a dangerous weapon, a knife with a 12.5cm blade, and had focused
his attack on a vulnerable part of the Victim’s body, <em>viz</em>, the chest. Two of the stab wounds
suffered by the Victim were described by the CA as “likely to have
been very deep, with [one of them] achieving full, or near-complete,
penetration of the knife’s 12.5cm blade” (CA Judgment at [25]). As
a result, the Victim suffered an agonizing and painful death. Secondly, Wang’s
culpability was high. The prosecution examined Wang’s post-murder
actions and argued he was unremorseful. Particular attention was paid
to how Wang robbed from the Victim after he killed him, took steps
to conceal the murder, attempted to extort money from the Victim’s
family, prepared to flee from Singapore and, even after arrest,
led the police on a wild goose chase and gave several false statements.
The prosecution submitted that there were no significant mitigating
factors that Wang could rely on. Even though Wang experienced financial
stress and loneliness as a foreigner in Singapore, they were not
so unusual or extraordinary that he could rely upon them in mitigation.
As Yong Pung How CJ stated in <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny
v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [10], financial difficulties
cannot be relied upon, save, possibly, in the most exceptional or extreme
of circumstances. Thirdly, the prosecution submitted that Wang, being
stronger and much younger than the Victim, and having taken the Victim
by surprise from behind, had taken an unfair advantage over the Victim.
The prosecution also stressed the high degree of public disquiet
that had emanated from the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To
show how <em>frequent or widespread</em> offences
committed against taxi drivers are, the prosecution produced statistics
on the number of robberies, serious hurt and murder committed against
taxi drivers between January 2009 and September 2013. Significantly,
the number of serious hurt cases over the years are: two in 2009,
two in 2010, six in 2011, seven in 2012, and four in the period
from January to September 2013. The prosecution pointed out the
particular vulnerability of taxi drivers – they may be completely
at the mercy of their passenger-turned-assailant, and out of the reach
of any help that may be rendered by bystanders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
calling for a <em>deterrent</em> sentence,
the prosecution elaborated on the fact that public transport workers
(“PTWs”), especially taxi drivers, have been viewed by the courts
as vulnerable victims (see, <em>eg</em>,
the CA judgment at [3] and <em>Wong Hoi Len v Public
Prosecutor</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 115 at [11]). The prosecution
argued that the present case also has a wider-felt impact of triggering
unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public, which
makes it necessary and appropriate to order a deterrent sentence
(see <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007]
2 SLR(R) 814 at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At
the time of hearing, there were three other concluded murder re-sentencing
cases. In all these cases the court reduced the sentence of death to
a sentence of life imprisonment and caning. The prosecution argued
that these cases could be distinguished. In <em>Public
Prosecutor v Fabian Adiu Edwin</em> (Criminal Case No 40 of
2009) (“<em>Fabian</em>”), the offender was
young (18 years old at the time of offence) and had sub-normal intelligence.
In <em>Public Prosecutor v Kho Jabing</em> [2013]
SGHC 251 (“<em>Kho Jabing</em>”), the offender
was also considered to be young (24 years old at the time of offence)
and his choice of weapon was described as opportunistic and improvisational.
In <em>Public Prosecutor v Gopinathan Nair Remadevi Bijukumar</em> (Criminal
Case No 40 of 2011) (“<em>Gopinathan</em>”),
the CA did not find that the offender had set out to rob the victim
and had given the offender the benefit of doubt that he had been
provoked by the victim. The prosecution submitted that none of these
characteristics exist in the present case. Wang was already 30 years
old at the time of the offence. From the degree of planning that
went into his crime and the calculated steps he took to conceal
the evidence, the prosecution submitted that Wang was a highly intelligent
individual. Unlike <em>Kho Jabing</em>, Wang
in this case had prepared a knife and therefore, his choice of weapon
could not have been opportunistic. Lastly, unlike <em>Gopinathan</em>,
Wang set out to rob the Victim and was not provoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In
light of the foregoing, the prosecution submitted that the three precedent
cases do not bar the court from imposing the death penalty. In fact,
as the present case falls squarely within the category of cases
that would outrage the feelings of the community, the prosecution
urged the court to re-sentence Wang to death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
defence relied on <em>Sia Ah Kew</em> for
the principle that the death penalty should only be imposed for
the worst manner of offending. The court was also referred to a
number of cases from across the Commonwealth and other jurisdictions,
which have a common thread of imposing the death penalty in the
most exceptional cases. Therefore, the defence submitted that the
death penalty should only be imposed if the manner by which the
murder was carried out was of the most heinous nature, the murderer
was of the worst type, and there was an absence of any significant
mitigating circumstances. The present case, the defence argued, was
not such a case where death penalty would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Much
emphasis was placed on the fact that there was a lack of any premeditation
to inflict the fatal injuries. What happened was a sudden and unexpected
struggle, during which Wang stabbed the Victim spontaneously. Given
that the intention to stab had formed only during the struggle,
it could not be said that Wang consciously took advantage of the Victim’s
vulnerability or planned to stab the Victim as part of the robbery. Neither
was the stabbing inflicted in cold blood as Wang did not relish
the act of murder and no further injuries were inflicted on the
Victim to ensure that he died.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
defence stressed that the post-killing acts, such as his extortion
of money from the Victim’s family, must be seen in context. They
were induced by panic, fear and adrenaline, and the defence urged
the court not to accord them undue weight in the formulation of
what his intention was at the beginning of the criminal enterprise
and when deciding the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To
further show that the moral blameworthiness of Wang was below that
for the most heinous cases of murder under s 300(<em>c</em>)
of the Penal Code, the defence raised a number of mitigating circumstances.
First, Wang did not form the intention to murder the Victim when
he set out to commit robbery; he only brought the knife to scare
his Victim into submission. Secondly, his mind was not at its clearest
when he had formed the intention to stab the Victim during the struggle.
At the time of the offence, he was labouring under difficult personal
and financial circumstances and when the Victim struggled, he reacted
on the spur of the moment without considering the consequences of
his actions. Thirdly, the Victim was not made to endure extended
pain and suffering; he went limp within two minutes of the struggle.
Fourthly, Wang was remorseful for his actions. The defence admitted
that Wang lied to the police initially, but highlighted that Wang
volunteered the truth later on. Lastly, Wang was not a hardened criminal,
and has the potential to reform and be rehabilitated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
defence referred to the four sentencing principles of deterrence, prevention,
retribution, and rehabilitation as affirmed by the CA in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008]
2 SLR(R) 684, as well as the principle of individualised justice
enunciated by V K Rajah J in the High Court decision of <em>Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005]
3 SLR(R) 1. Having regard to the circumstances of Wang’s act, the defence
submitted that all four sentencing objectives can be met by a sentence
of life imprisonment, and that life imprisonment was the appropriate
sentence to be passed in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There
were also three letters written by Wang’s father, sister and daughter
pleading for clemency. They mentioned that Wang’s 12-year-old daughter
yearned to see her father again, and that his parents were over
50 years old and wished to have the accompaniment of their son in
their old age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In
respect of the three precedent cases of re-sentencing, the defence drew
the court’s attention to the fact that none of the cases had meted
out the death penalty. On the other hand, in addition to the sentence
of life imprisonment, the three precedent cases had imposed either
18 or 24 strokes of cane. Because the defence submitted that an
additional punishment of no more than ten strokes of the cane was
appropriate, it had to distinguish the three precedent cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Fabian</em> and <em>Kho Jabing</em>,
the court had imposed the maximum of 24 strokes of cane. The defence
submitted that Wang’s culpability in this case was lower than that
of the offenders in <em>Fabian</em> and <em>Kho </em><em>Jabing</em> because
the offenders in the latter two cases had intended to use their
weapons to cause bodily injury in furtherance of their robbery.
The defence argued that no such intention was present in this case.
In <em>Gopinathan</em>, the court had imposed
18 strokes of cane. The defence submitted that Wang’s culpability was
closer to the facts of <em>Gopinathan</em> because,
in both cases, the robberies were motivated by desperate financial
circumstances. Nonetheless, the defence observed that the offender
in <em>Gopinathan</em> had maintained his
lie about another man who had killed the victim, whereas the offender
in this case had shown remorse at an earlier stage and volunteered
the truth to the police less than ten days after he gave the false
statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Given
the above, the defence submitted that the appropriate sentence in
this case was life imprisonment and no more than ten strokes of
the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
issue before me was whether the facts and circumstances of this case
justified imposing the death penalty or life imprisonment with or without
caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I
had found that Wang had not set out with the intention to kill,
but with the intention to commit robbery, armed with a knife. He
had targeted taxi drivers, presumably for their unique vulnerability.
He got the Victim to drive to a lonely spot and pointed the knife
at him to get him to surrender his money. However the Victim tried
to snatch or pluck the knife from Wang and a struggle ensued, resulting
in the tragic outcome. These would be the relevant facts of the
offence, although the aftermath provides some insight into Wang’s
frame of mind. When Wang realised that the Victim had gone limp,
he got out of the taxi, ascertained that the Victim was dead, and
proceeded to hide the body in the nearby jungle. He washed himself
in the sea, drove the taxi to a multi-storey carpark, washed off
the blood stains and took the Victim’s money and mobile phone. He
then attempted to leave the country. When the Victim’s wife called
his mobile phone, Wang took advantage of the situation and tried
to extort money from her by leading her to think that the Victim
was still alive and would be hurt if she did not pay up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It
was in the context of these facts, particularly the facts leading
to the killing, and to a lesser extent, the facts post-killing that
I have to determine the issue, along with other factors of the case,
namely the fact that the Victim was a taxi driver, and part of a
vulnerable group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
prosecution submitted that this was an offence against a PTW and
therefore a deterrent sentence was necessary. There have been cases involving
victims who were PTWs in which the courts have held that it was necessary
to impose deterrent sentences in view of their vulnerable positions
as well as the dangers posed to the public at large. I myself have stated
this in a Magistrate’s Appeal: see <em>Balbir Singh
s/o Amar Singh v Public Prosecutor </em><em>and
another </em><em>appeal</em> [2010]
3 SLR 784. But the expression “public transport worker” covers a
wide range of people. This ranges from PTWs who operate transportation
involving many passengers, such as buses or trains, to those who
carry much less, <em>eg</em> taxis. The degree
of danger to the public would vary with the numbers carried. However
the danger may be higher in certain modes of transport, <em>eg</em> aircraft. The degree of punishment imposed
could correspond to the degree of danger posed to the public. There
is the special case of taxi drivers, who are vulnerable because
they work alone and can be stranded in remote locations. However
it is one thing to impose a higher fine or period of imprisonment
for an offence against a taxi driver to deter like-minded from carrying
out offences against taxi drivers. It is quite another to say that
it is necessary and appropriate to impose a sentence of death where
life imprisonment is otherwise called for. For the court to justify
imposition of capital punishment on the ground of deterrence, the
prosecution must produce much more evidence to show the inadequacy
of life imprisonment (plus caning) as against the death sentence.
The only evidence of this produced by the prosecution was a single
incident of murder of a taxi driver in the past five years, which
was this present case. There have been a number of cases of serious
hurt against taxi drivers, but there is no upward trend nor are
the numbers high – the range of such offences vary from two a year
to seven a year in the last five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I
therefore consider that deterrence was not a major factor in determining
the sentence for the present case. The relevant parameters were
the facts of the offence, although keeping in mind that it was perpetrated
against a person belonging to a particularly vulnerable group. Wang
had set out to rob a taxi driver, but there was no evidence of any intention
to kill from the outset. Death was caused in the course of a struggle,
one that Wang ought to have anticipated. The prosecution made a rather
uncharacteristic submission that there was “a high degree of premeditation
and planning”, without stating that this was in relation to the offence
of robbery and not the murder. This was puzzling because the finding
of fact at both High Court and Court of Appeal was that the offence of
murder was not premeditated. That submission only had the unfortunate effect
of causing the media reports of the case to be misreported. As for
the acts post-killing, there was a range of explanations for it,
but Wang was entitled to the benefit of doubt that this was motivated
by self-preservation after the fact and not cold blooded intent.
The aggravating factor in this case was the fact that he took cruel
advantage of the desperation of the Victim’s widow and tried to
extort money from her while keeping up her hopes that the Victim
was still alive. But again there was no evidence that this was preplanned;
indeed the evidence points to them being opportunistic acts. Wang
deserved the full brunt of the law short of capital punishment.
In my view, the ends of justice were served by a sentence of life imprisonment
and, in view of the acts post-killing, to 24 strokes of the cane, which
was the maximum sentence I can impose short of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For
the reasons given above, I exercised my power under s 4(5)(<em>g</em>) of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act to
re-sentence Wang to imprisonment for life and to 24 strokes of the
cane.</p>
