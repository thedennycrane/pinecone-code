This fiduciary relationship therefore obliged the Defendant to provide the Plaintiff with an account of the Estate upon her request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In response, the Defendant contended that he did not owe the Plaintiff any fiduciary duties, because even though he is the sole executor of the Estate, he is not the trustee over the portion of the Estate of which the Plaintiff is a beneficiary. The Defendant contended that an executor’s duty is merely to call in and distribute the assets in the estate in accordance with the provisions of the will. Therefore, the Defendant argued that his duties to the Plaintiff had ceased upon his transfer of the Assets to Jethanand. The proper person for the Plaintiff to seek an account from should therefore be Jethanand and not the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues for determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, there were two main issues that had to be determined in deciding whether or not to grant the Plaintiff’s application:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Plaintiff was entitled, as a matter of law, to an account of the Estate from the Defendant, and if so, for what assets and over which period of time; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the answer to issue (a) was answered in the positive, whether there existed any good reasons for this court to exercise its inherent discretion not to make an order for the Defendant to provide an account to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s entitlement to an account from the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I will first deal with the issue of whether the Plaintiff was entitled to an account of the Estate from the Defendant. It is settled law that the executor of a will owes the beneficiaries under the will fiduciary duties. It is the fiduciary relationship that provides the basis for this duty to account (see <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Cocke and Another</span> [1988] 1 Ch 414 at 420). As was stated in my earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and others</span> [2016] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>”) at [80]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is also the duty of the executor[s] to keep proper accounts of the administration of the estate that they are dealing with.

This was on the basis that the Plaintiff is merely a discretionary beneficiary under the Will, and therefore whatever interest she has in the Estate would purely be at the discretion of Jethanand as her trustee.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I disagreed. There is a distinction to be made between the beneficiaries under two types of discretionary trusts. The first type of trust involves <span class="font-italic">named</span> beneficiaries whose benefits to be paid out of the estate are solely at the discretion of the trustee, such as the Plaintiff in this case. The second type of trust involves persons who are only <span class="font-italic">possible</span> beneficiaries of a discretionary trust, where there is a large number of such possible beneficiaries. To clarify, the latter scenario envisions a trust structure in which there is a wide class of possible beneficiaries, and the trustee may be given the power to add to this class of beneficiaries other persons with the exception of certain stated individuals. This was the type of trust that was considered in <span class="font-italic">Hartigan Nominees Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another v Rydge</span> (1992) 29 NSWLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Hartigan</span>”), where the “Eligible Beneficiaries”, and thus possible beneficiaries, to the trust included “any children[,] grandchildren or great-grandchildren” of the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> settlor. In addition, Eligible Beneficiaries could include persons who were nominated in writing to the trustees by the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> settlor, his legal representatives, or the trustees themselves. In such a trust structure, there would exist a large number of possible beneficiaries who would only have an interest in the trust if they have been declared as beneficiaries by those who have the power to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The beneficiaries under these two types of trusts may both be loosely termed as “discretionary beneficiaries”. Indeed, the Defendant used that term to describe the Plaintiff as a type of beneficiary falling into the former category. However, while the same label is used on both types of beneficiaries, it does not mean that they have similar rights in respect of the trust nor should it be interpreted that way. In my view, a beneficiary falling into the former category such as the Plaintiff should be entitled to accounts. On the other hand, a possible beneficiary belonging in the latter category would have no such right (see <span class="font-italic">Hanbury and Martin: Modern Equity</span> (Jamie Glister &amp; James Lee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2015) at para 20-018). A person in the former category has an identifiable interest in the estate regardless of the manner in which the trustee’s discretion is exercised, and therefore has a corresponding right to an account. In contrast, a person in the latter category does not have an identifiable interest in the estate until it is decided that he will be a beneficiary. Mahoney JA stated at pp 431–432 of <span class="font-italic">Hartigan</span> that notwithstanding a trustee’s obligation to provide an accounting in respect of the administration of the trust upon such a request being made by the beneficiaries, it may be that such a right to an account does not exist where the request is made by a person who is only a possible beneficiary under a discretionary trust. Mahoney JA further stated: “I doubt that a person whose interest lies not in property but in possibility and is in respect of part but not all of the trust property may demand such information.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It has often been said that a discretionary trust is one which gives a beneficiary no right to any defined part of the income or capital of the trust fund. The beneficiary has no more than a hope that the discretion will be exercised in his favour (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 22-005). In a similar vein, <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(3), <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span> (LexisNexis, 2017 reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(3): <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span>”) states at para 110.531:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Discretionary trusts which are exhaustive call for a distribution ultimately of the trust property and confer on beneficiaries a <span class="font-italic">spes</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>or hope of an exercise of discretion in their favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Nevertheless, this should not affect the principle that the Plaintiff as a named discretionary beneficiary of the Will has an identifiable interest in the Estate such that she would <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be entitled to an account of the Estate. <span class="font-italic">Gartside </span><span class="font-italic">and Another v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [1968] AC 553 at p 617 also states that a beneficiary under a discretionary trust has an interest in that he has the right to be considered as a potential recipient of benefit by the trustees and a right to have that interest protected by a court of equity. This explains the comment in <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 22-005 that the discretionary beneficiary’s interest is proprietary in character since it gives him a stronger equitable title to the trust property than a third party with no entitlement at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I move then to examine the scope and extent of this duty to account. The Plaintiff had sought to rely on <span class="font-italic">Lalwani Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span>”) at [20] to argue that a trustee’s duty to account is a continuous one, and that the transfer of trust assets to new trustees does not obviate the original trustee’s duty to account. However, I would note that an executor or a trustee should only owe a beneficiary a duty to account in relation to matters that occurred <span class="font-italic">during his term as a trustee</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [11]). Properly understood, this continuing duty is a duty on the trustee to provide accounts to the beneficiary when requested, and this duty to account for his past conduct continues even after the trustee has transferred the trust assets to another party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  However, this continuing duty does not mean that the trustee will remain accountable for the trust assets in the period after they have been transferred to another party. Therefore, any account provided by the trustee will necessarily be confined to the assets which he was in control of, and only for the period that he was actually the trustee over these assets. The same principle applies where a claim is brought against an executor for an account of estate assets that are to be subsequently held by trustees under discretionary trusts as set up by a will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Applying this to the present facts, the Defendant should therefore only be liable to account to the Plaintiff for the period that he was acting as executor and her trustee, and only in relation to the Assets of which she is a beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In summary, the Defendant was in a fiduciary position as executor <span class="font-italic">viz</span> the beneficiaries and was subject to the duty to account for his conduct for the period up to the transfer of the Assets to Jethanand as required by the Will, or to the Plaintiff in accordance with Jethanand’s instructions. The Plaintiff rightly pointed out that an executor steps into the shoes of a trustee once he has discharged his duties of calling in and collecting the assets of the estate and paying off all necessary funeral, testamentary and estate expenses and liabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Tsong Sai Sai Cecilia and another</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 516 at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It follows that where the will creates trusts over the estate assets, once the executor properly transfers the assets to the appointed trustees he will cease to be accountable for those assets. By this, what is meant is that whilst the executor remains accountable for the period when the assets were under his control, he is not accountable for those assets for the period after they are transferred to the trustees in accordance with the terms of the will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On this basis, once the Defendant had transferred the Assets to Jethanand (and, in the case of the Property, to the Plaintiff), the Defendant ceased to be the Plaintiff’s trustee, and would accordingly not have to account for the Assets henceforth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assets and time period that the Defendant should be accountable for</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Title to a testator’s estate vests in the executor immediately upon the death of the testator (see <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks</span><span class="font-italic"> on Executors, Administrators and Probate</span> (John Ross Martyn &amp; Nicholas Caddick gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2013) at para 5-02). Therefore, the Defendant was vested with title to the Assets on 4 March 2007, which is the day the Testator passed away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Defendant thereafter transferred the Clause 5 Shares to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. Therefore, for the period between 4 March 2007 and 1 August 2008, the Defendant would have been holding the Clause 5 Shares on trust for the Plaintiff and the other beneficiaries, and he would hence be liable to account for the Clause 5 Shares during that period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for the Property, the Defendant had been the registered proprietor and legal owner (by way of transmission on the Testator’s death) up until 12 October 2016, after which he transferred legal title to the Plaintiff in accordance with the instructions of Jethanand.

</div>
</div> Therefore, the Defendant would have been holding the Property on trust for the Plaintiff and the other beneficiaries from 4 March 2007 to 12 October 2016, and would be liable to account for the Property during that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Finally, with regard to the Plaintiff’s interest in one-third of the Residuary Estate, the Defendant had given evidence that after consolidating all the remaining assets and accounting for all the Estate-related expenses, this resulted in an overall deficit. This deficit was subsequently borne by the Defendant and Jethanand in equal shares. Be that as it may, it appeared to me that the Defendant would have had legal title over the Residuary Estate, at least up to the point where the assets under of the Residuary Estate were presumably liquidated to pay for the Estate-related expenses. During such time, he would have been holding the Residuary Estate on trust for the Plaintiff and the other beneficiaries. Therefore, in my view, the Defendant would also owe the Plaintiff a duty to account for the Residuary Estate from 4 March 2007 up until the point where it was completely used to account for the Estate-related expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasons for this court not to order an account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Notwithstanding the Plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitlement to an account from the Defendant for the Assets during the time period as identified above, I was of the view that this was not a case which warranted the calling of an account. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>, notwithstanding a beneficiary’s entitlement to an account from his trustee, the court may in its discretion decline to make an order for the taking of accounts if it would be oppressive for the trustee to so account, or if there was some other good reason to so decline (see <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span> at [81]). The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng</span> [2015] 3 SLR 770 observed at [89] that “[w]hether the trustee/personal representative has complied with his duty to supply documents and information is a fact-sensitive exercise in every case.” Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 stated at [39] that “the court may be able to draw an inference, on a balance of probabilities, that settled accounts have <span class="font-italic">already</span><span class="font-italic"> been provided</span>” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, there was no need to order the Defendant to provide further accounts to the Plaintiff given that the Defendant had already sufficiently discharged this duty. In coming to this decision, I noted that the question as to whether the Defendant had provided a sufficient account was a fact-sensitive inquiry. That said, I was reminded that a critical aspect of the custodial fiduciary relationship is the duty of the trustee (and executor) to keep accounts and to permit inspection by the beneficiaries for the purpose of (i) providing information as to the current status of the estate or trust assets; and (ii) as a means for ascertaining whether, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, maladministration has taken place (see <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, I considered the Defendant’s duty to account in relation to the Clause 5 Shares. The Defendant had exhibited in his affidavit a document stating that there were no dividends declared in relation to eight companies during the period from 4 March 2007 to 1 August 2008 (although I note the inconsistency between this document and the Clause 5 Shares as pointed out at [18] above). The Plaintiff responded in her own affidavit stating that “[t]his document is completely self-serving”.

</div>
</div> Yet, the Plaintiff did not apply to cross-examine the Defendant on the evidence given in his affidavit which indicated her acceptance of the veracity of this evidence. The Defendant had also exhibited in his affidavit the stamp duty certificates for the transfers of the Clause 5 Shares that were made to Jethanand on 1 August 2008. Despite this, the Plaintiff stated at the hearing that she was not satisfied with such evidence, and wanted sight of the actual share transfer forms. However, she did not explain why this was necessary, nor did she seriously seek to challenge the authenticity of the stamp duty certificates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the circumstances, I saw no reason to doubt the Defendant’s evidence as it stood. He had accounted for the Clause 5 Shares during the period which he held them on trust for the Plaintiff, including whether or not there were any dividends declared. Therefore, I found that he had sufficiently discharged his duty to account for the Clause 5 Shares, and accordingly there was no need for me to make an order for the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, I considered the Defendant’s duty to account in relation to the Property. It is the Plaintiff’s own evidence that she, Jethanand and their three sons had been living in the Property for the past 31 years and continue to reside there to date.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Plaintiff had confirmed during the hearing that there had never been a question of renting out the Property. Therefore, it can safely be assumed that there would be no rental income to account for in relation to the Property. Furthermore, a title search conducted on 16 September 2016 showed that there were no encumbrances on the Property. All things considered, it was clear to me that the Plaintiff and her family had lived in the Property unhindered for the past 31 years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In light of this, I found the Plaintiff’s demand for an account of the Property to be unreasonable, given that there would simply be nothing to account for. It is evident that there was no rental income earned from the Property. The title search on the Property conducted on 16 September 2016 showed that it was then free of any encumbrances. If the Plaintiff was concerned that there may have been any prior encumbrances on the Property as a result of loans that the Defendant may have borrowed to his own advantage, it would have been open to her to find out by simply conducting a historical information search. For those reasons, it would have been unnecessary to order the Defendant to provide an account of the Property and therefore I declined to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Third, I considered the Defendant’s duty to account for the Plaintiff’s share of the Residuary Estate. As was mentioned, the Residuary Estate was completely used to pay for the Estate-related expenses. In this regard, the Defendant had exhibited a breakdown of the accounts for the Residuary Estate in his affidavit. I saw no reason to disbelieve this evidence. If the Plaintiff was truly sceptical about the evidence provided by the Defendant, it would have been open to her to have the matter proceed to trial instead where the evidence could then be tested by cross-examination. Therefore, I was satisfied that the Defendant had provided an account of the Residuary Estate to the Plaintiff, and there was also no need for me to make an order for the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As a final point, I would note that the Plaintiff had argued that the Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties by failing to inform the Plaintiff of her interest under the Will.

</div>
</div> The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 339 has clarified at [87] that a trustee’s duty to account is not contingent on there being a breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duties. However, the Court did add that where such a breach could be established, the beneficiaries would all the more be entitled to an account. Therefore, if it could be established in the present case that the Defendant had indeed breached his fiduciary duties, this might have been a factor to sway me in favour of granting the Plaintiff’s application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It is the executor’s foremost duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries when carrying out his duties or exercising his powers, in the sense that he must do his best to promote the beneficiaries’ affairs (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(3): <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 110.213). The question that arose was whether the failure on the part of the Defendant to inform the Plaintiff of her interest under the discretionary trusts was (i) a breach of his duty and (ii) if so, a breach that justified the ordering of an account in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There was no claim against Jethanand in these proceedings for an account of the Assets. The fact that Jethanand was and still is the Plaintiff’s husband and that their marriage appears to have broken down did not make any difference. The Plaintiff did however submit that whilst Jethanand’s conduct was not part of these proceedings, the “wilful silence” of the Defendant in failing to inform the Plaintiff and her sons of the contents of the Will enabled any misconduct Jethanand may be guilty of in respect of the Assets.

Her apparent failure to ask Jethanand, her trustee and her husband, about the Will and the Estate over so many years was said to be “odd”. This court notes that this might not be significant if she had no reason to think there was a will in the first place. It was apparent however that she was aware that there was a will although she was not informed of the details and her interest until much later around November 2016.

</div> The Defendant on the other hand pointed out that the Plaintiff must have been aware of the terms of the Will or the relevant discretionary trust at the latest by around September 2016. Nothing turned on this slight difference in timing. To be sure, the Plaintiff could have conducted a search to ascertain whether probate had been granted for any will and to inspect the Testator’s file. If she had done this, she might have discovered her discretionary beneficial interest very much earlier. This did not however detract from the principle that the Defendant as executor should have informed the Plaintiff of her interest under the Will and the discretionary trusts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 That said, based on the material put before this court, it did not appear that the Plaintiff had suffered any loss. Indeed, the Plaintiff had received all that she could have hoped for pursuant to the terms of the Will and the discretionary trusts. She remained in continuous residence (rent-free) of the Property. Eventually, full and unencumbered title of the Property was transferred to her on 12 October 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Accordingly, even if the Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties by not informing the Plaintiff of her interest, I am of the view that the breach was not such that led to the conclusion that an account must be ordered of the Property for the period between the Testator’s death and 12 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Whilst I found for the Defendant, it is apposite to underscore the serious nature of the duties imposed on executors and trustees of discretionary trusts. The fact that a will creates a discretionary trust does not mean that a member of the class of beneficiaries does not have any recognised interest in the assets of the discretionary trust. It follows that the Plaintiff was and is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to an account from Jethanand being the trustee of the Assets in which the Plaintiff has a discretionary interest. As was rightly stated in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 9(4),<span class="font-italic"> Equity and Trusts</span> (LexisNexis, 2017 reissue) at para 110.790, note 1, the duty to render accounts is one of the trustee’s most basic duties. For avoidance of doubt, this comment is made bearing in mind that Jethanand’s conduct as trustee was not an issue that was before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Defendant in this case was the executor of the Will under which the discretionary trusts were created. The Defendant was not the named trustee of the Assets to which the discretionary trusts related. In my view, the Defendant as the executor ought to have informed the Plaintiff of her discretionary interest under the trusts as part of his duty to call in the assets and to distribute the same in accordance with the Will. This duty also included the transfer of the relevant Estate assets to the respective trustees for administration by them in accordance with the terms of the discretionary trusts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It follows that the Defendant as executor was under an obligation to provide an account to the Plaintiff of the Assets up to the point when the Assets were transferred to Jethanand or dealt with in accordance with Jethanand’s instructions. That said, I was of the view that it would be unnecessary to make an order for the Defendant to do so given that he had already satisfactorily discharged this duty in the course of filing his reply affidavits for this application, bearing in mind there was no application to cross-examine him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Accordingly, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application. Nevertheless, I noted that the Plaintiff’s concern might have been addressed by quicker and fuller responses by the Defendant. Looking at the circumstances, I ordered fixed costs of $2,000 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Melanie Ho, Chang Man Phing, Chan Yu Xin and Valerie Quay (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Gopalan Raman (KhattarWong LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
