between two major shareholders of the 1st Defendant, AIQ Pte Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">AIQ</span>”); namely, the 1st Plaintiff – Marten Joseph Matthew (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Joe</span>”) – and the 3rd Defendant, Goh Soo Siah (“<span class="font-weight-bold">GSS</span>”). The dispute initially arose from these two shareholders’ disagreement over their respective funding responsibilities for AIQ and its subsidiary, the 2nd Defendant, The Carrot Patch Pte Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">TCP</span>”). As AIQ became mired in financial difficulties, the dispute between the two shareholders spilled over into other areas, with the directors of AIQ being drawn into the fray as well. Joe was<span class="font-italic"> </span>eventually removed as a director of both companies. Shortly thereafter, he and the 2nd Plaintiff – Thames Global Enterprises Ltd (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Thames</span>”, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands) – commenced the present suit against GSS and AIQ’s directors (the 4th to 7th Defendants). The Plaintiffs alleged, in gist, that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had oppressed their interests as minority shareholders of the two companies and that they had also conspired to injure the Plaintiffs by unlawful as well as lawful means. The companies, AIQ and TCP, were joined as nominal defendants to the Plaintiffs’ action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ action.

AIQ’s core business included the development of software, including a visual recognition technology software meant for use in Android or iOS based mobile devices. AIQ’s main assets were the visual recognition technology (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">VRT</span>”) that was being developed and the intellectual property rights thereto.

In gist, on 14 December 2017, Joe had transferred to Thames his entire shareholding in AIQ. According to Joe’s claims at trial, Thames was wholly owned by him and held its 27.42% shareholding in AIQ as a “nominal shareholder”, with Joe owning the entire beneficial interest in those shares.

The facts relied on by Joe and Thames in support of their claims have been set out in detail in their Statement of Claim. Not surprisingly, the Defendants disputed the Plaintiffs’ version of events and pleaded their own version. The Defendants also raised objections to the case advanced by the Plaintiffs at trial, on the ground that the latter had – in their closing submissions – departed from their pleaded case.

</div>
</div>
</div> In these written grounds, I will explain my findings in respect of the Plaintiffs’ alleged attempts to deviate from their pleaded case. For ease of reference, I first summarise below the principles which I bore in mind in considering the Defendants’ objections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As a general rule, a “court may not make a finding or give a decision based on facts not pleaded and a finding or decision so made will be set aside” (<span class="font-italic">Wei Ho-Hung v Lyu Jun [2022] 2 SLR 1066</span> at [62]–[63]; <span class="font-italic">China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd v Shao Hai</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 479 (“<span class="font-italic">China Construction</span>”) at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Lu Bang Song</span><span class="font-italic"> v Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2009] SGHC 49 (“<span class="font-italic">Lu Bang Song</span>”) at [16]). Facts that are material to a party’s claim or a party’s defence must be pleaded (<span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd and others</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 (“<span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span>”) at [22]–[23]). The definition of “material” in this context has been explained by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">UJT v UTR and another matter </span>[2018] 4 SLR 931 (“<span class="font-italic">UJT v UJR</span>”) (at [48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“Material” means necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action, and if any one material statement is omitted, the statement of claim is bad: <span class="font-italic">Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd</span> [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712 per Scott LJ, approved by the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [29]. And even if the facts are not material to the cause of action, they may be facts in issue at the trial, and they would therefore be material facts that must be pleaded to avoid surprise at trial: see <span class="font-italic">Millington v Loring </span>(1881) 6 QBD 190 at 195 per Lord Selborne LC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The above principle is also encapsulated in O 18 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts, not evidence, to be pleaded </span>(O.18, r.7)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.—(1)  Subject to this Rule and Rules 10, 11 and 12, every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved, and the statement must be as brief as the nature of the case admits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The rationale behind this principle is to prevent surprises from arising at trial by defining the issues in dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Lu Bang Song</span> at [17]; <span class="font-italic">UJT v UJR</span> at [48]) and also to provide the opposing party with adequate opportunity to prepare and present his own case, by informing the opposing party in advance of the case to be met (<span class="font-italic">China Construction</span> at [26]; <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak</span> at [22]–[23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Departure from this general principle is normally permitted only in limited circumstances. Although a court retains the discretion to allow an unpleaded point to be raised, this is done chiefly when no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be clearly unjust for the court to withhold its permissions (<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking Bhd v ASL Shipyard Pte Ltd and others</span> [2019] SGHC 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>”),at [42]–[43]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Plaintiffs had </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">locus standi</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> to bring </span><span class="font-weight-bold">proceedings under s 216 of the Companies Act in respect of the alleged oppression of their rights as members of the 1st Defendant (AIQ)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I first address the preliminary issue of <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>.

They contended that Joe lacked the <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the AIQ-related claims because Joe ceased to be a member of AIQ after transferring his shares to Thames on 14 December 2017. As at the date when the present suit was filed on 25 September 2018, therefore, Joe had no standing to pursue the oppression claim under s 216 of the Companies Act insofar as it related to AIQ.

</div> This, according to the Defendants, was because the AIQ-related allegations of oppression concerned acts which were said to have been commercially unfair to Joe. These allegations had nothing to do with Thames; and Thames could not claim that it had been oppressed. In particular, Thames could not claim to have been oppressed by breaches of the purported Understanding and Agreement when – on the Plaintiffs’ own case – Thames was not a party to the agreement.

</div> I rejected this objection. An examination of the parties’ pleadings showed that the Plaintiffs had pleaded at para 10 of their Statement of Claim that they were seeking relief under s 216 of the Companies Act “in their respective capacities as beneficial shareholder and registered shareholder of the [AIQ], and [Joe] in his capacity as the beneficial and registered shareholder of [TCP]”. In response, GSS and the 4th to 7th Defendants had in their respective Defences pleaded a denial of this particular paragraph of the Statement of Claim.

</div> In the present case, the bone of contention between the Plaintiffs and the 3rd to 7th Defendants centred on whether such an estoppel arose in Joe’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Plaintiffs argued that such an estoppel did arise in their favour in the present case. This, according to the Plaintiffs, was based on the 3rd to 7th Defendants’ conduct in having continued to treat Joe as the shareholder of AIQ despite their being aware that he had transferred his shares to Thames.

</div> For example, they had continued to approach Joe directly when seeking to raise funds for AIQ. In the circumstances, it would have been apparent to the 3rd to 7th Defendants that Joe’s participation in the affairs of AIQ remained unaffected by the transfer of his shareholding to Thames; and this extended to the Understanding and Agreement. According to the Plaintiffs, therefore, the 3rd to 7th Defendants had effectively represented that they would continue to treat Joe and Thames as “one and the same”. This meant that they were now estopped from asserting that Joe and Thames should be treated separately for the purpose of assessing their interest and <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>.

Indeed, the court in each of these two cases concluded that it would be unjust and inequitable to allow the respondents to do so. In contrast, in the present case, Joe had transferred his AIQ shares to Thames and ceased to be a member of AIQ <span class="font-italic">of his own volition</span>; the 3rd to 7th Defendants were not involved in Joe’s decision nor in the transfer of the shares in any way.

</div> Joe would need, therefore, to show that he fell within one of the recognised exceptions to the statutory requirement of registered membership. As all parties were agreed that the exception in s 216(7) did not apply to Joe, I do not address s 216(7) in these written grounds. Instead, Joe argued that the 3rd to 7th Defendants were estopped from denying his <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to pursue the AIQ-related oppression claim, <span class="font-italic">per </span>the exception allowed by the courts in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span>, the first respondent was a private company. The appellant was a registered shareholder of the company who held 1,500 shares. The company wrote to the appellant alleging that he owed it a sum of RM111,734.60. Although the appellant denied owing this sum, the company took action against him by passing a board resolution to sell his shares in satisfaction of the alleged debt. The proceeds from the sale of the shares proved insufficient to satisfy the alleged debt, and the company continued to press the appellant to pay the balance. The appellant brought a minority oppression action under s 181 of the Companies Act 1965. At first instance, the company’s application to strike out the petition was allowed by the trial judge, who cited as one of his reasons the appellant’s lack of standing to bring the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 On appeal, the Malaysian Federal Court disagreed with the trial judge’s reasoning. The court accepted, as a starting point, the general rule that a petitioner bringing an action under s 181 had to be able to “demonstrate that his name appeared on the company’s register of members at the date of presentation of the petition”. If this could not be done, then the petitioner had no standing. However, the Federal Court stressed that this was merely a general – and not a universal –  rule; and that there were cases where it would be unjust to apply the general rule. The Court gave the following example: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Take, for instance, the case of a person who has agreed to become a member, but whose name has been omitted from the register of members. If it transpires that prior to the dispute leading to the presentation of the petition, a company or its board had always treated the complainant as a member, it would not be open to them to assert that the petitioner lacked locus standi. Examples may be multiplied without any principle emerging from them. Take the facts of this very case. Here, we have a fact pattern where the appellant`s membership of the company had been terminated in circumstances which are being challenged by him on substantial grounds. The substantial ground he complains of is the deprivation of his membership in the company. He says that the circumstances attending this deprivation of membership falls within the framework of s181(1)(a) and (b). It is the company, acting through its board, that had deprived the appellant of the status of a member. Can the company be now heard to say that the appellant is no longer a member and is therefore disentitled from moving the court under s 181 of the Act and from questioning that very deprivation in proceedings brought under the section? <span class="font-weight-bold">We think not. For it does not lie in the mouth of the alleged wrongdoers to say that the appellant has no ground to stand on after having cut the very ground from under his feet.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On the above basis, the Federal Court took the view that the doctrine of estoppel could be applied to “prevent or preclude a litigant from raising the provisions of a statute in answer to a claim made against him in circumstances where it would be unjust or inequitable to permit him so to do”. As the Court put it, “a respondent who is guilty of unconscionable or inequitable conduct [would] not be permitted to raise or rely upon the requirement of membership in order to defeat a petitioner`s standing as this would amount to his using statute as an engine of fraud”. The company, having deprived the appellant of his membership, was estopped from asserting that he lacked the requisite standing to bring a claim for minority oppression.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span>, the appellant and the first respondent (“Nagan”) shared a decade-long friendship. The second respondent (“Siva”) was Nagan’s uncle. The appellant had experience in track-laying works from his job as a piling and civil engineering contractor. Nagan had approached the appellant and informed him that there was a project for track-laying works for the new North-East MRT line. A joint venture (“TUS”) consisting of Tekken Corporation (“Tekken”), Union Construction Co Ltd and Singapore Piling and Civil Engineering Pte Ltd was seeking to secure the project. The appellant, Nagan and Siva agreed that they would be equal partners if they were successful in obtaining a subcontract from TUS in relation to the project, and that the appellant would be made a director and shareholder in the company to be used as the vehicle for carrying out the project. However, Siva failed to transfer the shares to the appellant. A search that was subsequently done at the Registry of Companies (“RCS”) showed the appellant to be registered as a director, but not a shareholder, of the company. When the appellant queried the company’s auditor, he was told that the RCS would update the records after the annual returns were filed, and that 33,333 shares had been issued and registered in his name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Sometime after the company secured the project, the appellant received a notice calling for an extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of removing him as a director. He applied to court for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondents from proceeding, arguing <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that their conduct was oppressive. The case went on appeal after the first-instance judge refused to grant the interlocutory injunction. One issue which arose on appeal was whether the appellant had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue under s 216. The Court of Appeal (“CA”) acknowledged (at [25]) that under s 216, only a member or a holder of a debenture of a company was entitled to seek relief, and that a registered shareholder was a member. It was essential for this purpose that a shareholder’s name be on the register. That being said, while the RCS search did not show that the appellant was a registered shareholder of the company, this was not conclusive. The CA pointed out that the appellant had been informed that he <span class="font-italic">was</span> a registered shareholder and that the RCS records would be updated after the annual returns were filed. Referencing <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span>, the CA noted (at [26]) that the Federal Court had held in that case that “under certain circumstances, it would be possible for a person whose name was not on the register of members to petition under s 181 of the Companies Act 1965 (the Malaysian equivalent of our s 216)”. Noting that this exception operated on the basis that the respondents would be estopped from raising an objection to the petitioner’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, the CA held (at [27]) that the respondents in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span> were estopped from asserting that the appellant was not a member. The CA pointed out that the appellant had agreed to become a shareholder of the company and had rendered invaluable services to it: it was entirely the default of those responsible for the administration of the company (including the respondents) that the appellant’s name had not been entered in the register of the company. The appellant’s belief that he was a member was reinforced not only by what the company’s auditor told him, but also by the fact that he had been sent the notice of the EGM and a proxy form – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>documents which were only despatched to members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  From the above, it may be seen that the facts of the present case were clearly distinguishable from the facts of <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span>. Unlike the respondents in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim </span>whose inequitable conduct was found to have resulted in the appellants not being registered members, the 3rd to 7th Defendants in this case had no part to play in Joe ceasing to be a registered member of AIQ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 More fundamentally, the judgments in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span> made it clear that they were allowing only a narrow exception to the statutory requirement that a claimant in a minority oppression suit must be a registered member: in order for a non-member to assert successfully that the defendant was estopped from denying his standing to bring the suit, there must be shown an element of unconscionability in the defendant’s conduct, and this unconscionable conduct had to relate to the circumstances in which the claimant’s name was omitted from the register of members. In both <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span>, the respondents’ conduct had led to the appellants/ claimants not being registered members of the company; and without being registered members, the appellants had no standing to pursue their claims of oppression against the respondents. This meant that in substance, the respondents’ wrongful actions against the appellants not only led to wrongdoing against the appellants, but also caused the latter to lack the standing to pursue their claims in respect of such wrongdoing. In such a scenario, the respondents would clearly be using the Companies Act as an “engine of fraud” if they were to invoke the appellants’ lack of <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> (<span class="font-italic">Owen Sim</span> at 135). It was in these circumstances that an element of unconscionability was found to arise in both <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim: </span>in each case, the respondents’ wrongful actions against the appellant constituted<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">the reason </span>for the latter’s lack of standing under the Companies Act, and it was therefore inequitable for the respondents to rely on the requirements of the statute in denying the appellants’ lack of standing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the present case, the Plaintiffs contended that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had treated Joe “as if” he was the registered shareholder of AIQ, and that Joe himself had acted on the basis that he – “being one and the same as Thames”

</div> – would for all intents and purposes continue to be the registered shareholder. In these circumstances, the Plaintiffs argued, it would be unconscionable of the 3rd to 7th Defendants to object at this juncture to Joe’s standing to sue under s 216 of the Companies Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my view, the present case simply did not fit within the narrow confines of the estoppel exception allowed in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Owen Sim.</span> To reiterate, the present case was one where Joe had <span class="font-italic">voluntarily transferred</span> his AIQ shareholding to Thames: Joe did not cease to be a member of AIQ as a result of anything done (or omitted to be done) by the 3rd to 7th Defendants. In fact, it should be highlighted that it was Joe himself who had “long requested” and insisted that the 3rd to 7th Defendants effect the transfer of his AIQ shares to Thames, his “children’s trust”.

</div>
</div> There was no basis, therefore, for the Plaintiffs to accuse the 3rd to 7th Defendants of unconscionable conduct in relation to Joe’s present status as a non-member. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In coming to the above conclusion, I found support in the High Court’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah</span> (at [12]–[13]). In that case, Chua JC (as he then was) distinguished <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy</span> on the basis that the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Kitnasamy </span>“was for all intents and purposes a shareholder except that the company had not registered him as one”. As such, the respondents – who had failed to effect the registration – could not challenge the appellant’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> of the applicants. Chua JC also cited with approval the statement in R Hollington QC, <span class="font-italic">Hollington on Shareholders’ Rights</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2013) at para 9-15, that “where a registered shareholder has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">freely</span> disposed of his shares … he will no longer have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> once he has ceased to be registered as a member” [emphasis added in bold italics]. This was because (at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">it is trite that the matters complained of under s 216 must affect the applicant <span class="font-italic">qua</span> shareholder and that the court’s powers under s 216(2) are to be exercised “with a view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of”. <span class="font-weight-bold">With one exception, it is difficult to see how a plaintiff would still be entitled to a remedy under s 216 if he has ceased to be a shareholder. In such circumstances, it seems to me quite </span><span class="font-weight-bold">pointless to allow the plaintiff to carry on with the action.

After all, s 216 plainly requires that a claimant be a registered member. For reasons best known to the Plaintiffs, they failed to take any steps to resolve the issue of Joe’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> before filing the suit.

</div> However, the 3rd to 7th Defendants contended that Thames lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>in the present suit. <span class="font-italic">Per </span>the 3rd to 7th Defendants, Thames had no basis to complain about its rights as a member being oppressed, because on the Plaintiffs’ own case, the oppressive acts were directed at Joe and not Thames. Moreover, some of the oppressive acts had allegedly been carried out against Joe after Thames became the registered shareholder in place of Joe. Thames could not complain of having suffered commercial unfairness as a result of the alleged acts of oppression. Since Thames and Joe were not one and the same entity, the interests of Thames and Joe were not one and the same. In this connection, the Defendants cited <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the case of <span class="font-italic">Suying Design Pte Ltd v Ng Kian Huan Edmund</span> [2020] 2 SLR 221 (“<span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>”) (at [123]), where the CA held that ultimately “the conduct complained of under s 216 must affect the member <span class="font-italic">in his capacity as member</span>” [emphasis added].

Indeed, the Plaintiffs could not dispute this proposition, given the clear state of the authorities: see <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Ching</span>. However, the Plaintiffs argued that as the registered shareholder, Thames was merely holding the AIQ shares as Joe’s nominee; that Joe remained the beneficial owner of the AIQ shares; and that Thames’s interests were thus co-extensive with Joe’s. On this basis, the Plaintiffs contended, it would be artificial for the court – when assessing the s 216 claim brought in Thames’ name – to ignore the oppressive acts committed by the 3rd to 7th Defendants against Joe in the period prior to Thames becoming a registered shareholder.

</div> According to the Plaintiffs, not allowing Thames to rely on the oppressive acts committed during Joe’s time as a shareholder for the purposes of Thames’s own oppression claim would amount to imposing an “arbitrary” restriction on the scope of the term “interests” in s 216 of the Companies Act and lead to absurd results. It would mean that no matter how unfairly the 3rd to 7th Defendants had treated Joe, Joe would “have an interest but no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span><span class="font-italic">”,</span> whereas Thames would “have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> but no interest”, such that neither of them would be able to seek relief.

In <span class="font-italic">Estera Trust</span>, one of the issues in contention was whether a trustee holding shares in a company on behalf of a beneficiary could assert that its own interests as a member had been prejudiced, on the basis that the beneficiary’s personal interest in remaining in management had been prejudiced. The court in <span class="font-italic">Estera Trust</span> held that since the trusts were discretionary trusts and not bare trusts, the beneficiary’s personal interests could not be conflated with the interests of the trustee.

</div> and in such a situation, it followed that the registered shareholder would not be able to bring an oppression claim asserting the beneficial shareholder’s personal interests as its own.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 While the 3rd to 7th Defendants accepted that a member seeking relief under s 216 could in principle rely on oppressive acts that had been done before he became a member of the company, they disputed Thames’ standing to bring a s 216 claim in respect of acts done to Joe prior to the transfer of his shares to Thames. More generally, they disputed Thames’ standing to bring a s 216 claim in respect of acts done to Joe which did not prejudice Thames’ interests as the registered member. This included acts which – according to the Plaintiffs – constituted breaches of the Understanding and Agreement between GSS and Joe. In this connection, the 4th to 7th Defendants also disputed the Plaintiffs’ assertion that Thames’ interests as the registered member were wholly aligned and co-extensive with Joe’s interests as the alleged beneficial owner of the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Before I address the parties’ arguments, I examine the relevant authorities and outline the key legal principles established by these authorities which were relevant to my consideration of Thames’ <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the AIQ-related oppression claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The law relating to <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring a minority oppression claim under s 216 Companies Act</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) A registered member can bring an oppression suit in respect of oppressive acts against the beneficial owner of the shares if he is a nominee for the beneficial owner</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah</span>, Chua JC (as he then was) pointed out, at [20], that “the common thread underlying [s 216 of our Companies Act] is that of unfairness”, with “[t]he common test [being] that of ‘a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect’”. In his view, this meant that “an applicant under s 216 has to show that he is an aggrieved shareholder, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that the conduct complained of is commercially unfair <span class="font-italic">to him</span>” [emphasis in original]. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah</span>, the plaintiffs (“Mr Lim”) and (“Mr Heah”) had sold their shares to a third party (“Mr Kwok”) after failing to sell the shares to the other shareholders. However, the defendants (“Mr Han”) and (“Mr Wang”), who were the directors of the company, did not approve the transfer of the plaintiffs’ shares to Mr Kwok. Finding themselves unable to exit the company, the plaintiffs commenced an action under s 216 of the Companies Act against the defendants. Unexpectedly, Mr Han and Mr Wang entered into a “Share Sales and Purchase Deed” whereby they undertook to transfer the plaintiffs’ shares to Mr Kwok by a certain date – and agreed, in addition, to buy the same shares from Mr Kwok for $19.5m, subject to the latter successfully persuading the plaintiffs to file a notice of discontinuance of their action. The transfer of the shares by the plaintiffs to Mr Kwok was thereafter registered; and Mr Kwok became the shareholder in place of the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs did not discontinue their action; and the purchase of Mr Kwok’s shares by the defendants did not materialise. Mr Kwok then applied to be joined as a plaintiff to the oppression action; and in so doing, he sought to rely on the claims made by Mr Lim and Mr Heah – as well as the evidence they had already adduced in court. One of the issues in contention before the court was whether Mr Kwok should be allowed to be joined as a plaintiff to the oppression action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Chua JC found (at [160]) that the defendants’ misconduct had been commercially unfair to Mr Kwok because notwithstanding the fact that the conduct complained off had taken place before Mr Kwok became a shareholder of the company, the overpayment of directors’ fees and the payments to SVF – which were the oppressive acts complained of – had “significantly reduced the funds available to the Company”. In the circumstances, the defendants’ misconduct was commercially unfair to Mr Kwok.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, in respect of Thames’ <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring proceedings under s 216, the key question of principle in contention was whether a registered member could sue for oppression in respect of oppressive acts done to the beneficial owner of the shares. While the parties were not able to point me to any relevant local case law on this issue, a number of English authorities were put forward. These appear to establish that a registered member may bring such proceedings if he is a nominee shareholder holding the shares on a bare trust, because in such a situation, the interests of the registered member are regarded as being co-extensive and wholly aligned with the beneficial owner’s interests. I refer to the cases of <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lloyd, Rock Nominee</span> and <span class="font-italic">Estera Trust</span>, which I examine below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>, a company (“Brightview”) was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring a number of internet providers, consolidating them and then selling off the business as a going concern. A and B shares were issued. One of the respondents (“Mr Shalson”), controlled the majority of the A shares through a company (“Reedbest”). As for the B shares, the majority were controlled by Mr Barton’s wife through another company, JGR. Both Mr Barton and his wife were not registered as shareholders of Brightview, nor was Mr Barton the beneficial shareholder of any shares. The parties had agreed to participate in Brightview on the terms of an investment agreement under which Mr Shalson was obliged to enter into a loan agreement to finance the project. Reedbest later lent Brightview an amount repayable on demand, but the terms of that loan turned out to be more onerous than those in the loan agreement; and no shareholder approval was provided as required by the investment agreement. Brightview was unable to meet Reedbest’s demand for repayment which resulted in an administration order being made against Brightview. The company’s business was then bought over by Freshbox, a company owned by the A shareholders and the B shareholders consequently lost their financial stake in the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Mr Barton, his wife and JGR issued two sets of proceedings. One was an action for breach of contract; the other was a petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 which provided: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Order on application of company member</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order under this Part on the ground that the company's affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself) or that any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The provisions of this Part apply to a person who is not a member of a company but to whom shares in the company have been transferred or transmitted by operation of law, as those provisions apply to a member of the company; and references to a member or members are to be construed accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The respondents applied to strike out the s 459 petition and the action for breach of contract. In respect of the s 459 petition, it was argued <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that as Mr Barton and his wife were not members of a company within s 22 of the UK Companies Act 1985 and held no shares by operation of law within the meaning of s 459(2), they had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the petition and should accordingly be struck out as petitioners. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As for JGR, the respondents argued that although JGR was registered as a member of the company, it was but a bare nominee. As such, having no economic interest in the value of the Brightview shares registered in its name, it could not complain of any prejudice to its “interests” under s 459. The respondents highlighted that the dispute arose from an alleged breach of the investment agreement to which JGR is not a party. In essence, it was a dispute between Mr Barton and Mr Shalson. The respondents argued that JGR was not a nominee for Mr Barton, and that Brightview was not a quasi-partnership: therefore it could not be permitted to “carry” or otherwise rely on the Bartons’ complaints to maintain the s 459 petition in its name (at [35] of <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99  Jonathan Crow KC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, agreed that Mr Barton and his wife had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the action for minority oppression, reasoning (at [31]) that the “right to petition the court under s 459 is conferred only on members and those to whom shares have been transferred by operation of law”; “neither Mr nor Mrs Barton” fell within those categories. In addition, a procedural provision such as CPR 19.2(2)(a), which gave the court the power to add parties, did not assist the petitioner’s case. CPR 19.2(2)(a) was “confined to cases where it was desirable” for the party to be added so that the court could “resolve all the matters in dispute in the proceedings”. Given that a dispute under s 459 could not be said to have arisen at the suit of a person who was not a member, CPR 19.2(2)(a) could not be invoked to support the joinder of a non-member as a party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As to JGR’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>vis-à-vis the s 459 petition, however, Jonathan Crow KC declined to strike out JGR’s claim on the basis that it was a nominee shareholder. Noting that the interests which s 459 was capable of protecting included matters going beyond the legal owner’s economic interest in the shares registered in his name (at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">O’Neill and another v Phillips and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1999] 1 WLR 1092 (“<span class="font-italic">O’Neil</span><span class="font-italic">l v Phillips</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 1110–1101), he observed that the phrase “legitimate expectations” may “embrace matters such as an understanding as to the governance of the company, including an understanding that someone other than the registered shareholder should be involved in management” (citing the <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> remarks of Hoffmann J in <span class="font-italic">Re a company (No 003160 of 1986)</span> [1986] BCLC 391 at 396). He held, moreover, that the respondents’ arguments amounted to “imposing an arbitrary restriction on the scope of the word ‘interests’ in s 459” (at [36] of <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…As a matter of statutory interpretation, there is no justification for doing so. Indeed, it would in my judgment be a thoroughly retrograde step to do so: it would mean that, in a case like this, no matter how disgracefully Mr Shalson might have behaved, Mrs Barton would have an interest but no locus, and JGR would have locus but no interest, so neither could complain. There is no reason at all to infer that the parliamentary draftsman intended such an arbitrary result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In particular, Jonathan Crow KC observed (at [37]) that while this specific point had never been argued or decided, it was “striking” that numerous cases had been argued and decided on the assumed basis that “a nominee shareholder [was] fully entitled to complain under s 459 about any diminution in value of the shares registered in its name, and that its ‘interests’ [were] for these purposes co-extensive with the interests of the beneficial owner” (<span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span> at [37] citing <span class="font-italic">Estill v Cowling Swift &amp; Kitchin</span> [2000] Lloyd’s Rep PN 378 at [101], <span class="font-italic">Arrow Nominees Inc v Blackledge</span> [2000] 1 BCLC 709 at 711, <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span> at [48]–[49], and <span class="font-italic">Rock Nominees Ltd </span>at [2]–[3]). Ultimately, in his view (at [38]), it was “well arguable” for the purposes of the striking out application that the ‘interests’ of a nominee shareholder under s 459 was “capable of including the economic and contractual interests of the beneficial owners of the shares”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 For completeness, I make two other observations. First, in <span class="font-italic">Atlasview, </span>Jonathan Crow KC did state that although all he had to do was consider “whether it [was] properly arguable that the ‘interests’ of a nominee shareholder under s 459 [were] capable of including the economic and contractual interests of the beneficial owners of the shares”, if he had been obliged to decide on the point, he would have found that it was correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Second, I note that although <span class="font-italic">Atlasview </span>was cited locally by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span> (at [56]), it was not cited for the proposition that “a nominee shareholder [was] fully entitled to complain under s 459 about any diminution in value of the shares registered in its name, and that its ‘interests’ [were] for these purposes co-extensive with the interests of the beneficial owner”. This was because in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>, the plaintiffs were no longer registered as shareholders of the company by the time the oppression proceedings under s 216 Companies Act were brought; and the court held (at [54]) that their claims to beneficial ownership of the shares held by two of the defendants did not assist them since trusts – whether express, implied or constructive – were not recognised under s 195(4) Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Turning to <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>, this was a case where the 1st respondent and the petitioner had formed a company, with the 1st respondent holding 51% of the shares and the petitioner holding 44%. The 1st respondent was appointed as the managing director, while the petitioner continued with his existing employment outside the company formed. As part of an agreement to conceal the petitioner’s shareholding from his existing employer, his 44% shareholding was held in trust for him by the 1st respondent. By 1990, the company had grown significantly and needed larger premises. The 1st respondent began to arrange for monies – partly from the company’s bank account – to meet the needs of the company. The 1st respondent also paid himself remuneration of £456,417 between 1992 and 1996, with the petitioner receiving in excess of £55,000 during that same period of time. Eventually, the petitioner became dissatisfied with the 1st respondent’s management of the company; and at his request, the 44% shareholding held on trust for him was transferred back to him by the 1st respondent in 1997. Shortly after, the petitioner started an oppression claim under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985, alleging unfairly prejudicial conduct by the 1st respondent in the form of unequal distributions, excessive payments by the company, and excessive contributions to a pension scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In resisting the oppression claim, the 1st respondent contended <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that in light of the repeated references to “members” in s 459(1), s 459 must require “that the petitioner shall have been a member of the company at the time the conduct complained of occurred”. The 1st respondent submitted that where, “at the time when the conduct complained of took place, the petitioner’s shares were held on his behalf by another person as bare trustee for the petitioner”, that conduct – assuming it to have been unfairly prejudicial – “was prejudicial not to the interests of the petitioning member but to the interests of the beneficiary under the bare trust (who was not a member at the time) or to the trustee of that trust (who, although then a member, is not the petitioner)”. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">per </span>the 1st respondent’s submission, s 459 would afford the petitioner no remedy in respect of any conduct complained of unless that conduct was “of such a kind as to be continuing after the petitioner became a member” (<span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span> at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Ferris J (at [49]–[50]) rejected such an interpretation of s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985. He explained his reasons as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 That interpretation of the section would, it seems to me, give rise to some strange results in the circumstances of the present case. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Let it be assumed that the affairs of the company have been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of everybody interested in the company except Mr Casey [the 1st respondent] and Mr Holman. There would thus be unfairly prejudicial conduct to Mr Casey’s interests as a trustee holding shares on behalf of Mr Lloyd [the petitioner], although not to his interests as holder of his own shares. Clearly Mr Casey would not petition under s 459</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, and if Mr Lloyd took steps to enforce the trust, the court could not direct Mr Casey to take proceedings against himself. The obvious remedy would be for the court to enforce the trust by directing Mr Casey to transfer the shares to Mr Lloyd himself or to a new trustee who would be independent.</span> This is in substance what has in fact happened, because Mr Casey, as he was bound to do when so requested, has transferred Mr Lloyd’s shares to Mr Lloyd himself without the need for proceedings to enforce the trust. But if the submission of Mr Bompas QC [counsel for the 1st respondent] were right, this act, while qualifying Mr Lloyd to petition under s 459, has simultaneously provided Mr Casey with a complete defence to that petition because the conduct in question, although prejudicial to the interests of Mr Lloyd’s trustee at the time when it took place, was not prejudicial to the interests of Mr Lloyd.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I would be reluctant to construe s 459 as having this effect unless compelled to do so. I think that I am not so compelled because the section applies not only where the conduct complained of is continuing but when it lies in the past – see the words ‘the company’s affairs are being <span class="font-italic">or have been </span>conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial’. I do not think that the words in parentheses which require that, where the unfair prejudice is to the interests of part only of the company’s members, that part must include at least the petitioner, ought to be allowed to have the effect of requiring that the petitioner shall have been a member when the past conduct took place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 While the reasoning in the above passages focused on the proposition that a member bringing a s 459 petition could rely on unfairly prejudicial conduct which had occurred before his becoming a member (and indeed <span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>was cited by the court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah </span>for this proposition), the assumption implicit in the portion I have highlighted appeared to be that where the petitioner’s shares were held on his behalf by another person as bare trustee for the petitioner, and where the affairs of the company had been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members, there would be unfair prejudice to the interests of the trustee who held the shares on bare trust, and such a trustee would be able to bring a s 459 petition (leaving aside the scenario where the trustee himself was the one accused of the unfair conduct, in which case the “obvious remedy” would be for the court to direct him to transfer the shares to the beneficiary or to an independent new trustee). This was why, in <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>, Jonathan Crow KC cited <span class="font-italic">Lloyd </span>as an example of a case decided on the “assumed basis” that “a nominee shareholder” was entitled “to complain under s 459 about any diminution in value of the shares registered in its name, and that its ‘interests’ [were] for these purposes co-extensive with the interests of the beneficial owner”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Another example of such a case which Jonathan Crow KC cited was <span class="font-italic">Rock Nominees</span>. In that case, the petitioner (“Rock”) brought an oppression claim against,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the 1st respondent (“RCO”) and the 2nd respondent (“ISS”) under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985. Rock held shares equivalent to 2.48% of RCO’s issued share capital, as a nominee for two companies (“Gambier” and “Kiwi”). Gambier and Kiwi were thus the beneficial owners of the RCO shares. The facts of the case were somewhat involved. In gist, ISS had launched a takeover bid for RCO because it wanted to take advantage of certain “synergies” that were projected to come about as a result of its acquisition of RCO. ISS was unable to acquire sufficient shares to enable it to compulsorily acquire the shares of the minority shareholders under the “squeeze-out” provisions of the UK Companies Act 1985. Rock’s nominee clients wished to retain their shareholding in RCO. ISS then adopted a procedure to acquire the benefit of the synergies and to deprive the minority shareholders of any right to participate in them, pursuant to which it sold the shares in RCO’s operating subsidiary to the 3rd respondent which was a member of the ISS group. RCO subsequently went into members’ voluntary liquidation. In presenting a petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985, Rock alleged that its interests as a minority shareholder in RCO had been unfairly prejudiced by the sale, which – according to Rock – was at an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Peter Smith J dismissed the petition. Although he found that the actions of the respondents and the manner in which they disposed of the assets constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the officers of RCO, the price paid by the 3rd respondent actually reflected a fair value for the shares which included a premium element for synergies. As such, Rock’s interests “were neither prejudiced nor prejudiced in an unfair way” (at [141]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Pertinently, in coming to the above conclusion, Smith J also stated that “Rock certainly had an interest to justify presenting a petition”. Implicit in this statement was an acceptance that as a nominee shareholder, Rock’s interests were the same as the interests of Gambier and Kiwi, who – as the beneficial owners of the shares – were the ones really at risk of suffering any loss in the value of the shares from the allegedly undervalued sale. If it were otherwise, there would have been no “interest to justify” Rock in presenting the s 459 petition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 At this point, it should be remembered that in <span class="font-italic">Atlasview, </span>Jonathan Crow KC was dealing with an application by the respondents to strike out the s 459 petition, as well as the action for breach of contract, on the basis of (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) lack of <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. Insofar as he had to consider the issue of whether a nominee shareholder’s interests under s 459 could include the economic and contractual interests of the beneficial owners of the shares, he considered this issue in the context of determining whether it was “properly arguable” in law. He did not have to decide the disputed issue of fact as to whether JGR was actually a nominee for Mr Barton. In <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>, it was not disputed that the 1st respondent was a nominee shareholder for the petitioner, who held the latter’s 44% shareholding on a bare trust. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Rock Nominees</span>, there was no dispute that insofar as Rock held 2.48% of RCO’s shares in its name, it did so purely as nominee for Gambier and Kiwi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Estera Trust</span>, the court declined to find that the registered shareholder was in fact a nominee shareholder holding the shares on bare trust for the beneficial owner of the shares. In that case, the first respondent (“JS”), the second respondent (“Verite”) and the third respondent (“Jemma”) faced an application under ss 994–996 of the UK Companies Act 2006 from the first petitioner (“Estera”) and the second petitioner (“HS”) who was JS’s younger brother. JS’s and HS’s parents (“BM Singh” and “Mrs Kaur”) had established trusts (the “Jersey trusts”) which held the shares of the family company. Estera, Verite and Jemma were the trustees of the Jersey trusts. The Jersey trusts were later “divided” between trusts that the settlors wished to be regarded as principally for the benefit for JS’s immediate family (the “Jasminder trusts”) and those that they wished to be regarded as principally for the benefit of HS’s immediate family (the “Herinder trusts”). After a number of years, Estera became the sole trustee of the Herinder trusts while Verite and Jemma were the joint trustees of the Jasminder trusts. In their s 994 action, the petitioners Estera and HS claimed that the affairs of the family company had been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to their interests as members of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 One of the issues which Fancourt J had to consider was whether Estera could complain that its interests as shareholder in the family company had been unfairly prejudiced by the removal of HS from the board of the family company. Fancourt J noted (at [223]) that it was “difficult to see” how Estera could contend that <span class="font-italic">it </span>had a “right for HS to remain a director and senior manager of the Company”. Recognising this difficulty, the petitioners sought to advance two arguments: firstly, that the removal of HS from the board was unfairly prejudicial to Estera’s interests as shareholder because Estera’s interests were best served by having a representative (HS) on the board; secondly, that on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Atlasview</span>, the interests of Estera included the interests of its principal beneficiary, HS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The first argument was rejected by Fancourt J (at [225]) on the ground that Estera had no legal or equitable right, as shareholder, to have an appointee on the board. The removal of HS thus did not unfairly prejudice its interests as shareholder because it had no such right. As for the second argument, this too was rejected. Referencing <span class="font-italic">Atlasview, </span>Fancourt J accepted that in principle, “the interests prejudiced may include the interests of a person for whom the shareholder holds as nominee”, and that it was “readily understandable” that in such a situation, “[t]he real shareholder interest is that of the true owner”. However, on the facts before him, he found that the Jersey trusts were “discretionary trusts and [were] <span class="font-italic">not nominees</span>; and as such –</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 …on orthodox principles, it seems very difficult to equate the interests of one only out of a broad class of discretionary objects with the trustee’s interests. HS had not been appointed to any interest under the Herinder trusts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 …[I]t is not obvious why it suffices that the removal of HS was unfairly prejudicial to one of the discretionary beneficiaries of the Herinder trusts, even a beneficiary to whose wishes the trustees are requested to have regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 … This is not a case where Estera has suffered prejudice to its interests as a member of the Company and other prejudice to other interests… It is a case where Estera may have suffered some prejudice to its interests as a member of the Company, through having lost a friendly representative on the board, but not unfairly so. HS was not removed in breach of any rights that Estera had, but was removed pursuant to the exercise of Verite/Jemma’s rights under the Company’s articles. Estera therefore did not suffer prejudice unfairly, since as a minority shareholder it had no right to have a friendly representative on the board of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 It is only if it can properly be said that in some way Estera suffered the unfair prejudice suffered by HS that Estera can legitimately complain under section 994 that the Company’s affairs have been conducted unfairly prejudicially to <span class="font-italic">its </span>interests as member. There is no authority drawn to my attention for the proposition that a trustee shareholder may rely in that regard on prejudice unfairly caused to someone who is a member of a class of discretionary beneficiaries under the trust. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 By way of elaboration, a discretionary trust is one in which the trustees have the discretion to distribute the property as they wish to people from a particular class of potential beneficiaries. The objects of a discretionary trust do not have an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property because the trustee’s discretion may not be exercised in their favour. Instead, they only have an expectation that the trustees might exercise the discretion in their favour (<span class="font-italic">Equity &amp; Trusts: Text, Cases, and Materials</span> (Paul S Davies and Graham Virgo eds) (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2019 (“Equity and Trusts”) at p 30 and 31). It was in this context that Fancourt J, having found the Jersey trusts to be discretionary trusts, highlighted that “[o]n orthodox principles, it seems very difficult to equate the interests of one only out of a broad class of discretionary objects with the trustee’s interests”. In this respect, the discretionary trust may be contrasted with a bare trust, where the trustee has no active duties to perform, and merely holds the legal title for the beneficiary. In the meantime, the trustee has no duties to perform and must deal with the trust property in accordance with the instructions of the beneficiary (Jamie Glister &amp; James Lee, <span class="font-italic">Hanbury &amp; Martin: Modern Equity</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 22nd Ed, 2021) (“Hanbury &amp; Martin”) at [2-034]). In the case of a bare trust, the beneficiary retains an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I should also point out at this juncture that although the parties did not address the definition of a “nominee shareholder”, it appeared from their submissions that parties understood this term to refer to a registered shareholder who held the shares on a bare trust for another party, who therefore did not own the beneficial interest in those shares, and who had to deal with the shares according to the instructions of the beneficial owner. For instance, Joe contended that despite his having transferred his AIQ shareholding to Thames on 14 December 2017, GSS and the 4th to 7th Defendants continued to treat him effectively as the true shareholder in AIQ – and rightly so too, according to Joe.

</div>
</div> This understanding of the term “nominee shareholder” would be consistent with the definition accorded to it by the courts. In <span class="font-italic">Kotagaralahalli Peddappaiah Nagaraja v Moussa Salem and others</span> [2023] SGHC 6, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J considered (at [8]) that the appointment of one of the defendants as a nominee shareholder meant that she held the shares on trust and had “no beneficial interest whatsoever in the [s]hares”. In <span class="font-italic">Hotung and another v Ho Yuen Ki</span> [2002] 4 HKC 233 (“<span class="font-italic">Hotung</span>”), the Hong Kong Court of Appeal (“HKCA”) – citing with approval at [14] the definition in <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(17th edn, 2000) at para 1-21 – noted (at [14]–[15]) that: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14. A bare or simple trustee, especially of shares in a limited company, is often called a nominee. He is a mere name or “dummy” for the true owner: <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(17th edn, 2000) at para 1-21.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15. In cases of bare trustee, the beneficiary may call for a conveyance of the legal estate at any time, and the trustee must comply. In the meantime the trustee has no duties to perform and must deal with the trust property in accordance with the instructions of the beneficiary: <span class="font-italic">Hanbury &amp; Martin on Modern Equity </span>(16th Ed) p 71.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In sum, therefore, where a nominee shareholder holds shares on behalf of the beneficial owner, it holds the legal title to the shares on the latter’s behalf and does not own the beneficial interest in those shares; the latter is the true owner of the shares. In such a situation, the English cases cited above appear to accept that the nominee shareholder’s interests are one and the same as the beneficial owner’s; in the context of a claim by the nominee shareholder that its interests as shareholder have been unfairly prejudiced by the manner in which the company’s affairs are conducted, the nominee shareholder’s “interests” for the purposes of such a claim may therefore include the economic and contractual interests of the beneficial owners of the shares.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In my view, the above position must be correct as a matter of law. If it were otherwise, the nominee shareholder would never be able to bring a claim for oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act in respect of oppressive acts: the nominee shareholder would always have no such interest <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, since the interest affected would always be that of the beneficial owner of the shares. As Ferris J noted in <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>, this would lead to an absurd situation in which the oppressor would be afforded a complete defence. Further, even if the beneficial shareholder were to effect the transfer of the shares to his own name and to register himself as a member, as the new registered member he would still have no interest capable of founding an oppression claim. This is because in a scenario where the nominee shareholder’s interests are not treated as being co-extensive with the interests of the beneficial owner, any unfair conduct that occurred prior to the beneficial owner becoming the new registered member would be regarded as having prejudiced the interests of the then nominee shareholder, but not the interests of the then beneficial shareholder. This is unless the unfair conduct that occurred previously remains unfair to the beneficial owner that has become the new registered member (as explained at [120]–[121] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It should be noted that while <span class="font-italic">Atlasview </span>recognises that the interests of the nominee shareholder includes the interests of the beneficial owner for whom it holds the shares, this recognition does not change the fundamental rules about <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>in oppression proceedings: it remains the case that under s 216, only a registered member may sue for oppression – barring the exceptions which may arise either by operation of s 216(7) or pursuant to an estoppel arising <span class="font-italic">per Kitnasamy </span>or<span class="font-italic"> Owen Sim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) A claimant under s 216 may rely on oppressive acts that were committed before he became a member of the company</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Assuming it could be shown that Thames was indeed a nominee shareholder whose interests were co-extensive and wholly aligned with Joe’s, Thames would – in principle – be entitled to rely on oppressive acts that were done to Joe before Thames became a member of AIQ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah</span> (at [18]–[25]), Chua JC observed that Mr Kwok had to cross several hurdles before he could be joined as a plaintiff. One hurdle (at [19]) was that the conduct complained about in the s 216 action by Mr Lim and Mr Heah – which Mr Kwok now sought to rely on – had taken place before Mr Kwok became a shareholder. In the case of <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>, the UK court had held that an applicant in an oppression action under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 could rely on conduct that had taken place before he became a registered shareholder. Chua JC observed that the reason for this decision lay in the words used in s 459: s 459 provided that “the company’s affair are being or have been conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial” (at [50] of <span class="font-italic">Lloyd</span>). Insofar as s 216 of the Singapore Companies Act was concerned, Chua JC (at [23]) noted that s 216(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) referred to acts that have “been done” and resolutions that have “been passed”. In his view, Mr Kwok could rely on acts that were done before he became a member of the company: s 216 merely required Mr Kwok (a) to be a member of the company when he applied for relief, and (b) to show that the defendants’ misconduct was commercially unfair to him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The conduct complained of under s 216 must affect the claimant in his capacity as a member of the company</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 It should be highlighted that even assuming Thames was a nominee shareholder whose interests were co-extensive with Joe’s, and that for the purposes of these s 216 proceedings, Thames could rely on oppressive acts done to Joe before Thames became a registered member, the Plaintiffs still had to satisfy “the <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member requirement”. This requires that the conduct complained of under s 216 must affect the claimant in his capacity as a member of the company: see <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span> at [123]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>, the plaintiff (“Mr Ng”) and the third defendant (“Ms Tan”) had jointly incorporated the first defendant company, Suying Metropolitan Studio Pte Ltd (“SMSPL”). Both Mr Ng and Ms Tan were shareholders and directors of SMSPL Following Mr Ng’s resignation from SMSPL, he and Ms Tan agreed to close down the company. Mr Ng subsequently brought a suit for oppression pursuant to s 216, claiming that Ms Tan had engaged in oppressive conduct which included (according to Mr Ng) misappropriating SMSPL’s funds, withholding payments he was entitled to, demanding that he return dividends and directors’ fees previously paid to him, and repeatedly taking steps “to deny or restrict his access to the books, ledgers, accounts, financial statements and other financial records of SMPSL”. In respect of the last allegation, it was shortly after the commencement of the oppression suit that Mr Ng had successfully obtained a court order allowing him to inspect the SMSPL accounts and records in his capacity as a director. Mr Ng claimed that Ms Tan had continued to deny him access to the SMSPL records even after the order for inspection was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As a preliminary point, the CA observed (at [122]) that the weight of the evidence showed that Ms Tan and SMSPL had in fact denied Mr Ng access to SMSPL’s financial documents. However, the CA highlighted (at [123]) that Mr Ng faced difficulties in trying to rely on this denial of access to SMSPL’s financial documents to support his claim of oppression. The first hurdle the CA identified was the fact that Mr Ng had sought the financial documents “in his capacity as a <span class="font-italic">director</span> rather than as a <span class="font-italic">shareholder </span>of SMSPL” [emphasis in original]. Citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Choon Yong v Goh Jon Keat and others and other suits </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 840 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Choon Yong</span>”) at [34], the CA pointed out that pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member requirement, the conduct complained of under s 216 must affect the claimant <span class="font-italic">in his capacity as a member</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The CA was at pains to explain that in assessing whether the <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member requirement was satisfied by a claimant, “a fact-sensitive approach should be taken”, given that “it is common for members to stand in multiple relationships vis-à-vis the company”, and ‘the scope of a member’s interests would depend on the understanding between the parties on the terms upon which they agree to associate together in the company” (at [123] of <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>). Thus, for example, if there was a clear understanding that the member would be entitled to participate in the management of the company, “the removal of the member as a director, or exclusion of the member from such management may affect the member’s rights <span class="font-italic">qua</span> shareholder”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>, the CA found (at [124]) that Mr Ng’s right to access SMSPL’s financial documents was plainly a director’s right. As the CA noted, “shareholders do not have a broad right to financial information of a company other than the audited financial statements pursuant to s 203 Companies Act” (<span class="font-italic">Ezion Holdings Ltd v Teras Cargo Transport Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 226). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In accepting that a fact-sensitive approach should be adopted in assessing whether the <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member requirement was fulfilled, the CA pointed out that in the context of an unfair prejudice petition under s 459(1) of the UK Companies Act 1985, the House of Lords had observed in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span><span class="font-italic"> v Phillips </span>(at 1105) that the requirement that the prejudice be suffered as a member “should not be too narrowly or technically construed”. It may be noted that similar observations were made by Hoffmann J in <span class="font-italic">Re a company (No 00477 of 1986</span>) [1986] BCLC 376 (“<span class="font-italic">Re a company (No 00477 of 1986</span>)”, at 378). In<span class="font-italic"> </span>that case, Hoffmann J opined that “the interests of a member are not necessarily limited to his strict legal rights under the constitution of the company”. He highlighted that the use of the word “unfairly” in s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 (the then equivalent of our s 216), “like the use of the words ‘just and equitable’ in s 517(1)(g) enables the court to have regard to wider equitable considerations” (at 379):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus in the case of the managing director of a large public company who is also the owner of a small holding in the company’s shares, it is easy to see the distinction between his interests as a managing director employed under a service contract and his interests as a member. In the case of a small private company in which two or three members have invested their capital by subscribing for shares on the footing that dividends are unlikely but that each will earn his living by working for the company as a director, the distinction may be more elusive. The member’s interests as a member who has ventured his capital in the company’s business may include a legitimate expectation that he will continue to be employed as a director and his dismissal from that office and exclusion from the management of the company may therefore be unfairly prejudicial to his interests as a member.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I will say more about the issue of “wider equitable considerations” in the context of oppression proceedings later in these written grounds (see [151151]–[157157]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It was with the above principles in mind that I examined the issue of Thames’ <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the AIQ-related oppression claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether Thames has standing to bring the oppression suit against AIQ</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 First, as alluded to earlier (see [8383]–[8585] above), the 3rd to 7th Defendants took the position that since the pleaded acts of oppression had allegedly been done to Joe and some of these acts had moreover been done to him after Thames became the registered member in his place, Thames could not complain that <span class="font-italic">its</span> interests as a member had been oppressed. Bearing in mind the reasoning of the courts in <span class="font-italic">Atlasview </span>and <span class="font-italic">Estera </span><span class="font-italic">Trust</span>, however, I did not think this objection was sustainable in principle. In their amended statement of claim, the Plaintiffs pleaded that Thames was a nominee shareholder (which they spelt as “<span class="font-italic">nominal </span>shareholder” in the statement of claim) holding the AIQ shares on behalf of Joe, who was said to own “100% of [Thames]”.

</div>
</div> <span class="font-italic">If</span> Thames was in fact a nominee for Joe and thus “a mere name or dummy” for Joe, then Thames’ interests as Joe’s nominee would be co-extensive and wholly aligned with Joe’s interests; and Thames would have the standing to bring proceedings under s 216 in respect of conduct oppressive to Joe’s interests. This would include conduct (allegedly) oppressive to Joe’s interests which occurred during the period when Joe was the registered member of AIQ, as well as conduct (allegedly) oppressive to his interests which occurred in the period after he transferred his shares to Thames, assuming it could be shown that such conduct affected Joe or Thames (as the case might be) in their capacity as a member of AIQ; <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the <span class="font-italic">qua </span>member requirement could be satisfied. As to whether or not this assumption was borne out on the evidence in the present case, I deal with this issue in the alternative at [133133] to [142142] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Similarly, I rejected the 3rd to 7th Defendants’ argument that since Joe – and not Thames – was party to the alleged Understanding and Agreement, Thames should not in principle be able to rely on any breaches of the Understanding and Agreement in support of its oppression claim. I rejected this argument because as noted above, <span class="font-italic">if </span>Thames were in fact a nominee for Joe and thus “a mere name or dummy” for Joe, its interests as Joe’s nominee would be co-extensive with Joe’s. Again, the assumption underlying my rejection of this argument was that the alleged breaches of the Understanding and Agreement affected Joe or Thames (as the case might be) in their capacity as a member of AIQ. As to whether or not this assumption was borne out on the evidence in the present case, I deal with this issue in the alternative at [133] to [142] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I emphasized above that Thames’ interests would be co-extensive with Joe’s <span class="font-italic">if </span>Thames were in fact a nominee for Joe. The next question, then, was whether Thames was in fact holding the AIQ shares as a mere nominee for Joe. The burden of proving this fact fell on the Plaintiffs, since they were the ones who had asserted it in their pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [58] and <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The 3rd to 7th Defendants appeared to accept in their pleaded defences that Joe owned all the shares in Thames, without actually admitting that these shares were held by Thames as his nominee on a bare trust. In any event, I make the following two related points. First, while it is true that s 60(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) states that facts admitted by parties to the proceedings need not be proved, s 60(2) of the Evidence Act provides that the court “may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admissions”. Second, in this connection, evidence adduced at trial in fact contradicted the proposition that Thames held the AIQ shares <span class="font-italic">purely as a nominee on behalf of Joe</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 To begin with, evidence adduced at trial of the Certificate of Incumbency in relation to Thames showed that it was in fact a company called NSR Services Ltd which owned 100% of the shares in Thames.

</div> The ordinary meaning of the words “<span class="font-italic">my children’s trust</span>” must surely be that Thames was a trust set up with his children as the beneficiaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Joe repeated his description of Thames as his “children’s trust” in other correspondence with the Defendants. I was referred to a letter dated 23 November 2017 from Joe’s then solicitors to the 4th to 7th Defendants, which letter repeated this description of Thames as Joe’s “children’s trust”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 From the above evidence, it was plain that far from treating Thames as <span class="font-italic">his</span> nominee in respect of the AIQ shares, Joe himself regarded Thames as his “children’s trust”; further, that in official or semi-official communications (including communications in which he was advised by lawyers), he also represented Thames to others as his “children’s trust”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Additionally, it seemed to me odd – indeed, anomalous – that Joe should have omitted to procure the transfer of the AIQ shares from Thames back to himself prior to launching the present s 216 proceedings. Having had the benefit of legal advice and representation from the outset, Joe could scarcely have been ignorant of the requirement for the claimant in a s 216 action to be a registered member of the company at the time of commencing the action. If Thames had indeed been a mere nominee holding the AIQ shares on trust for Joe, Joe would have been entitled to call for the shares to be transferred to him prior to commencing the present suit: Thames would have been obliged to deal with the shares according to his instructions (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">Hotung</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14]–[16]). That Joe omitted to take this simple step – and failed, moreover, to explain his omission to take this step – appeared to me to indicate some basis for the suggestion that Thames was actually his “children’s trust”, not his. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Given the above evidence, I was of the view that regardless of any admissions the 3rd to 7th Defendants might have made in their pleadings, the Plaintiffs needed to prove their assertion that Thames was holding the AIQ shares as Joe’s nominee. The Plaintiffs did not produce any evidence to back up their assertion. Indeed, they did not even offer any explanations for the various pieces of evidence which contradicted their assertion. In particular, there was no attempt to explain why Joe and his lawyers had on different occasions represented to others that Thames was his “children’s trust”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 To sum up, therefore, evidence adduced at trial contradicted the Plaintiffs’ assertion that Thames was holding the AIQ shares <span class="font-italic">as a nominee for Joe</span>. The Plaintiffs were unable, in other words, to satisfy me that the interests of the registered member Thames were co-extensive and wholly aligned with Joe’s interests. As such, I was unable to agree that Thames had <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to bring the suit under s 216 in respect of oppressive acts done to Joe (both before and after Thames became the registered member).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 This was unfortunate for the Plaintiffs, to say the least. Given that Joe did not fall within any of the recognised exceptions to the rule that only a registered member may bring proceedings under s 216, and in the absence of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>on Thames’ part to bring such proceedings, the Plaintiffs’ AIQ-related oppression claim could not even get off the starting blocks. This was because virtually all the allegations of oppression were pleaded and argued by the Plaintiffs as being conduct which affected <span class="font-italic">Joe’s </span>rights. For example, the winding-up of AIQ was alleged in the Statement of Claim to have oppressed <span class="font-italic">Joe’s</span> rights by depriving him of the ability to enforce a summary judgement he had obtained against AIQ. The Plaintiffs did not separately plead – nor did they separately explain – how <span class="font-italic">Thames’ </span>rights as shareholder were oppressed by the acts alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Having found against the Plaintiffs on the issue of Thames’ <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, I did nevertheless – in the interests of completeness – proceed to consider (at [196]–[544544544] below) the viability of the Plaintiffs’ AIQ-related oppression claims on the assumption that Thames possessed the standing to sue in respect of acts committed against Joe. I set out these findings in the alternative below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">If the requisite standing was present, whether the claim for minority oppression is made out pursuant to s 216 of the Companies Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 At [145] to [190], I first set out the general legal principles applicable to the consideration of oppression claims under s 216 of the Companies Act, before evaluating each of the Plaintiffs’ allegations of oppression at [203] to [544543] with the relevant principles in mind. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on minority oppression</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The test of “commercial unfairness”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The legal principles applicable to s 216 actions are well-established. In <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>, the CA - citing <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>its earlier judgment in <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and others v Tee Wee Sien and another appeal </span>[2020] 1 SLR 771 (“<span class="font-italic">Ascend Field</span>”) – reiterated that while s 216 encapsulated four limbs (oppression, disregard of a shareholder’s interests, unfair discrimination, and prejudice), the common element supporting these four limbs was commercial unfairness, which would be found where there had been a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing which a shareholder was entitled to expect (at [29] of <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>). The CA also emphasised (at [34]) that commercial unfairness “should be assessed against the behaviour the shareholder is entitled to expect or rely on, whether the expectation arises from a formal document or an informal understanding”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”), the CA elaborated on how the courts would assess commercial unfairness, citing (at [87]) the well-known passage from Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips </span>(at 1098-1099). In this passage, Lord Hoffmann was dealing with s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK), which – as the CA pointed out – was the English equivalent of s 216 Companies Act:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the case of section 459, the background has the following two features. First, a company is an association of persons for an  economic purpose, usually entered into with legal advice and some degree of formality. The terms of the association are contained in the articles of association and sometimes in collateral agreements between the shareholders. Thus the manner in which the affairs of the company may be conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders have agreed. Secondly, company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity, like the Roman societas, as a contract of good faith. One of the traditional roles of equity, as a separate jurisdiction, was to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights in certain relationships in which it considered that this would be contrary to good faith. These principles have, with appropriate modification, been carried over into company law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The first of these two features leads to the conclusion that a member of a company will not ordinarily be entitled to complain of unfairness unless there has been some breach of the terms on which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted. But the second leads to the conclusion that there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers. Thus unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> noted (at [88]) that the above extract from Lord Hoffmann’s judgment made it plain that “the essence of a claim for relief on the ground of oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct lies in upholding the commercial agreement between the shareholders of a company”. This was regardless of whether the agreement was “found in the formal constitutional documents of the company, in less formal shareholders’ agreements or, in the case of quasi-partnerships, in the legitimate expectations of the shareholders”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It should be highlighted that in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span><span class="font-italic"> v Phillips</span>, Lord Hoffmann expressly cautioned against an overly loose usage of the concept of “legitimate expectations” – an expression he had used in an earlier judgment in <span class="font-italic">In re Saul D. Harrison &amp; Sons Plc </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 14. Indeed, in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips</span>, he opined that it “was probably a mistake to use [the expression “legitimate expectations”]” in the earlier judgment, noting that it had been used as a “new label” to “describe a concept which [was] already sufficiently defined in other terms”. As he explained (at 1102):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In saying that [the concept of legitimate expectations] was ‘correlative’ to the equitable restraint, I meant that it could exist only when equitable principles of the kind I have been describing would make it unfair for a party to exercise rights under the articles. It is a consequence, not a cause, of the equitable restraint. The concept of a legitimate expectation should not be allowed to lead a life of its own, capable of giving rise to equitable restraints in circumstances to which the traditional equitable principles have no application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Referencing the above passage from <span class="font-italic">O’ Neill</span><span class="font-italic"> v Phillips</span>, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah v Lim Boh Yong </span>[2015] 5 SLR 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>”) that the concept of “legitimate expectations” was “of limited scope” and would not assist a s 216 claimant who based his claim on nothing more than his subjective expectations – even if there was a reasonable basis for the subjective expectations: <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> at [121]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>, the plaintiffs and the first and second defendants were brothers who were all shareholders in two companies known as “SSH” and “Kenson”. The plaintiffs brought a minority oppression action against the first and second defendants under s 216 of the Companies Act. In gist, the plaintiffs claimed that both SSH and Kenson were quasi-partnerships or “akin to quasi-partnerships”; and that accordingly, the court should look beyond the confines of the parties’ strict legal rights and obligations and instead look for “informal or implied understandings between the parties which give rise to legitimate expectations between them” (at [88]). It was on this premise that they argued that there was “an informal or implied understanding amongst the parties” that they were entitled to participate in the management of SSH and Kenson.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Coomaraswamy J noted (at [102]) that the starting point in establishing a minority oppression claim was for the claimant to show that the company was subject to equitable considerations which had arisen either at the time the parties’ relationship commenced or subsequently, and which made it unfair for those running the company to rely on their strict legal rights under the company’s articles of association and under the Companies Act. In this connection, he referred to <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1973] AC 360, where Lord Wilberforce had identified certain elements which may result in the superimposition of equitable considerations on a company:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Certainly the fact that a company is a small one, or a private company, is not enough</span>. There are very many of these where the association is a purely commercial one, of which it can safely be said that the basis of association is adequately and exhaustively laid down in the articles. <span class="font-italic">The superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more, which typically may include one, or probably more, of the following elements: (i) an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual confidence – this element will often be found where a pre-existing partnership has been converted into a limited company; (ii) an agreement, or understanding, that all, or some (for there may be ‘sleeping’ members), of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business; (iii) restriction upon the transfer of the members’ interest in the company – so that if confidence is lost, or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As noted by Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah </span>(at [106]) and subsequently in <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin (on behalf of himself and as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd) v Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span>” at [49]–[50]) , the quasi-partnership would be the archetypal association formed or continued “on the basis of personal relationships, involving mutual trust and confidence”. A quasi-partnership is typically a company whose affairs are conducted with a degree of informality, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where “the members do not transact on an arms-length basis, do not distil their informal agreements into formal contracts, and do not record their understandings in writing” (<span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]). Such companies are subjected to greater scrutiny by the courts because the informality with which their affairs are run may leave minority members vulnerable to exploitative conduct by the majority: in such cases, the courts will be more ready to examine the parties’ past conduct to ascertain if there are “any informal agreements or understandings between [them] which form the context for considering whether specific conduct is or is not commercially unfair” (<span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]). However, it is apparent from Lord Wilberforce’s judgement in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi </span>that the absence of a quasi-partnership in its traditional sense <span class="font-italic">per se </span>does not preclude the claimant in a minority oppression action from relying on legitimate expectations that may have arisen from implied or informal understandings between the parties; and if these implied or informal understandings are established on the evidence, they may form the basis for the superimposition of equitable considerations: see <span class="font-italic">Anita Hatta v Lee Siow Kiang Georgia and others </span>[2020] 5 SLR 304 (“<span class="font-italic">Anita Hatta</span>”) at [69]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>, the court found that the evidence of the manner in which the patriarch of the family had run the two companies before his death did not support the plaintiffs’ assertion that the companies were quasi-partnerships or companies akin to quasi-partnerships (at [115]). As for the plaintiffs’ assertion that there was an implied or informal understanding between the parties that they (the plaintiffs) were entitled to participate in the management of the companies, there was also no evidence of any such implied or informal understanding (at [122]). There was therefore no basis for the plaintiffs’ claim to a “legitimate expectation” to participate in management: they could not rely on any subjective expectation that they might have harboured that they would be entitled to participate in the management of either company (at [121]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In <span class="font-italic">Anita Hatta</span>, the plaintiff alleged that the 1st defendant’s actions between 2012 and 2017 constituted oppression of her interests as a minority shareholder in three companies in which she had invested $2m. The 1st defendant was the sole director of the companies; and the plaintiff had been introduced to her through a mutual friend some years prior to investing in the companies. Valerie Thean J did not accept that the companies in question were quasi-partnerships in the traditional sense, as the evidence showed that this was not a case where the parties worked in circumstances akin to a partnership; the plaintiff’s own evidence made it clear that she had not participated in the making of major decisions in the companies. Referencing Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">O</span><span class="font-italic">’Neill v Phillips</span>, however, Thean J accepted that outside of a quasi-partnership, “the commercial agreement [between the parties] may be of a different kind, carrying its own informal understanding”. Based on the evidence before her, she found that there was in fact an informal understanding between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, which included elements arising from the plaintiff’s responsibility as a 5% shareholder for signing off on financial statements, as well as the object of their joint enterprise as documented by the 1st defendant herself in a text. Thean J found that this informal understanding gave rise to certain legitimate expectations on the plaintiff’s part, some of which were breached by the 1st defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In <span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Kym Wendy and others v Thio Syn Pyn and others </span>[2017] SGHC 169 (“<span class="font-italic">Thio Syn Pyn</span>”), the plaintiffs (Wendy, Michael and Serene) were the minority shareholders in three companies (THPL, MDI and URL). They sued their siblings (Ernest and Patrick) and their mother (Mdm Kwik) – the majority shareholders and directors – for minority oppression. The plaintiffs claimed <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that the group of companies was a quasi-partnership; that there was a common understanding that the plaintiffs were entitled to participate and to remain in the management of the group as directors; and that the non-re-election of Wendy and Serene to the boards of THPL and MDI was therefore oppressive of their interests. Judith Prakash JA found, on the evidence before her, that the group was not a quasi-partnership, and that independent of whether the group was a quasi-partnership, there was no such common understanding as alleged among the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In respect of other allegations relating to the reduction of Michael’s remuneration, the increase in Ernest’s and Patrick’s remuneration, and the removal of Michael’s and Serene’s car benefits, however, Prakash JA accepted the plaintiffs’ contention that these acts were commercially unfair and therefore oppressive. She noted that based on the evidence, Michael had no legitimate expectation that he would receive a certain amount of remuneration or benefits as part of his employment with MDI. She also noted that the reduction of Michael’s salary and the removal of his and Serene’s car benefits did not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>affect their interests <span class="font-italic">qua </span>shareholders. However, she found it significant that Ernest and Patrick had made selective use of a consultants’ report to justify reducing Michael’s salary and removing his and Serene’s car benefits, while increasing their own remuneration in a manner which could not be reasonably explained and which was even (in one instance) contrary to the consultants’ recommendation. In respect of the reduction of Michael’s salary, there was also evidence that this was done out of spite and not pursuant to rational corporate considerations. Ernest and Patrick were aware that Michael’s employment resulted from familial, and not corporate, considerations: Mdm Kwik had wanted his livelihood to be provided for. His position was special, and while he might not have had a basis to expect his salary to be increased along with his brothers’, he “would confidently have expected that they would not reduce it so as to shrink his rice bowl” (at [85]). Prakash JA found that Ernest and Patrick had effected the salary reduction in order to “rap [Michael] on the knuckles for his disagreements with them and not as a measure for the overall corporate benefit”. In sum, her finding was that the two of them had cherry-picked the consultants’ comments and used the consultants’ report “selectively to benefit (or continue to benefit) themselves while using their power as directors and shareholders to deprive the plaintiffs of long-enjoyed benefits, and in the case of Michael, substantially so” (at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 To recapitulate, therefore: in the context of a s 216 claim, an assessment of commercial unfairness requires a consideration of whether there has been a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a member is entitled to expect (<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [77]); and this in turn requires a consideration of what exactly the member is entitled to expect. The applicable standard of fairness would then differ “depending on the nature of the company and the relationships of the shareholders” (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah </span>at [102]). In this connection, the baseline for determining the applicable standard of fairness is that members are entitled to "rely on their strict legal powers and rights under the company’s articles of association and under the Companies Act”. To go beyond this baseline, a member must show that the company is subject to equitable considerations arising either at the time when the parties’ relationship commenced, or subsequently, which makes it unfair for those conducting its affairs to rely on their strict legal powers and rights under the company’s constitution and under the Companies Act (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> at [102]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 It should further be highlighted that in determining whether there has been commercial unfairness, it is also important to distinguish unfairness from unlawfulness. Conduct that is technically unlawful may not be unfair (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah </span>(at [100]). Breaches of the Companies Act and/or the company’s constitution will not necessarily be regarded as oppression of the minority members’ interests unless something more is shown (<span class="font-italic">Lian Hwee Choo Phebe and another v Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd and others and another suit </span>[2010] SGHC 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Maxz Universal</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Proper plaintiff rule and no reflective loss principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In considering what a minority shareholder is entitled to expect, the court will also have to consider whether the breach of his expectation amounts to a distinct injury under s 216 Companies Act. The conceptual distinction between corporate rights and personal rights is a critical one. Section 216 is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be used to vindicate wrongs which are in substance wrongs committed against the company, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>wrongs<span class="font-italic"> </span>which are corporate rather than personal in nature. This is the proper plaintiff rule: <span class="font-italic">Suying </span><span class="font-italic">Design </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>(1843) 2 Hare 461. The rule stipulates that the proper plaintiff to sue for a wrong done to a company is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>the company, which is a separate legal entity from the shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The other side of the proper plaintiff rule is the “no reflective loss” principle. An aggrieved minority shareholder may not sue under s 216 if his loss lies in the diminution of the value of his shares in the company which merely reflects the company’s loss, which can be made good if the company were able to and did enforce its rights: <span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>”) at [61] and [70]; <span class="font-italic">Miao Weiguo v Tendcare Medical Group Holdings Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tian Jian Hua Xia Medical Group Holdings Pte Ltd) (in judicial management) and another </span>[2022] 1 SLR 884 (“<span class="font-italic">Miao Weiguo</span>”) at [200]–[201]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Further, as alluded to previously (at [122] above), a member claiming minority oppression must show that the distinct injury he has suffered amounts to commercial unfairness against him <span class="font-italic">as a member of the company</span>. Section 216 is designed for the protection of members of companies, and it is in that capacity that members of companies seek its protection – not as directors or employees (<span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162  In <span class="font-italic">Suying Design,</span> it will be recalled that the plaintiff Mr Ng had alleged oppressive conduct by the defendant Ms Tan which included misappropriation of SMSPL’s funds. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia,</span> Mr Ng claimed that Ms Tan’s conduct was in breach of an oral agreement which they had for the treatment of post-incorporation invoices. Ms Tan disagreed with Mr Ng as to what they had agreed on. At first instance, the High Court preferred Mr Ng’s version of the oral agreement. The High Court held that the injury Mr Ng sought to vindicate was the injury to his investment in SMSPL caused by Ms Tan’s breaches; that the misappropriation of funds was in breach of Mr Ng’s legitimate expectation as a shareholder that SMSPL’s funds would not be siphoned away; and that this had a direct impact on Mr Ng’s interests as a shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 On appeal, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>held (at [109]) that while the High Court’s reasoning appeared <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>to follow closely the reasoning employed in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span>”), in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span> the CA had held that “the real injury sought to be vindicated by the minority shareholder, Sakae, was the injury to its investment in the joint venture and <span class="font-italic">the breach of its legitimate expectations </span>as to how the company’s affairs and its financial investment were to be managed”. Crucially, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>had noted that the High Court judge in that case had “carefully considered how Sakae was personally affected by each of the impugned transactions” before finding that with the exception of one, “<span class="font-italic">the transactions had been carried out in breach of Sakae’s rights which had been carefully negotiated </span>for in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the joint venture agreement”. Sham documents had also been created to conceal these transactions. In addition, Sakae had let one Andy Ong manage the company’s affairs because of the longstanding relationship between Ong and the chairman of Sakae’s board. This was the basis on which the CA in <span class="font-italic">Sakae </span><span class="font-italic">Holdings </span>had held that Sakae had a legitimate expectation that its funds would not be mismanaged, much less siphoned away in the manner they had been. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>went on to hold (at [110]) that the mere fact that an injury has been caused to a shareholder’s investment did not mean that it would suffice to constitute a <span class="font-italic">distinct personal wrong</span>. There first needed to be careful consideration of whether the injury to the minority shareholder was merely a <span class="font-italic">reflection</span> of the injury caused to the company. Additionally, the CA highlighted that while a shareholder might be entitled to expect certain standards of fair dealing and fair play, especially where the majority shareholder and wrongdoer was also a director of the company, it did not necessarily follow that a breach of such standards necessarily formed a distinct personal wrong. <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span> represented an instance of a “clear, egregious and fraudulent breach of an express understanding” between the parties as to how their joint venture was to be carried out, and was thus distinguishable from the facts in <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span> (at [111]–[113]), the CA held that Mr Ng did <span class="font-italic">not</span> have any basis for any expectations as to how SMSPL would be managed, apart from the basic expectations a shareholder may legitimately hold, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a<span class="font-italic"> </span>reasonable expectation as a shareholder that SMSPL’s funds would not be siphoned away. The CA found that such a baseline expectation did not provide a sufficient basis on which to find that Mr Ng had suffered a distinct personal injury which would amount to commercial unfairness. To find otherwise would suggest that any misappropriation of moneys by a director would constitute a distinct injury to a shareholder; and this was not acceptable as it would be “too broad a construction of the framework” set out in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span> and would “make impermissible inroads into the proper plaintiff rule”. In any event, even if there were a distinct injury, it did not necessary follow that it would be commercially unfair to Mr Ng if the breaches were not remedied: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 …The claim in respect of the Gratuity Payment therefore should <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been brought under s 216. This is not to say that there was no wrongdoing, but rather, that any such wrong was one done to the company, and should therefore have been pursued under a different cause of action – such as a derivative action under s 216A…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 As the CA has acknowledged in various cases (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Sakae Holdings </span>at [86], <span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>at [32], <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee </span>at [62]), there may be cases where conduct amounting to a corporate wrong can also plausibly be said to constitute a personal wrong. How the conduct is to be characterised depends very much on the facts of each case. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>, the CA cited (at [67]–[68]) the following passage from the judgement of<span class="font-italic"> </span>Millett J in <span class="font-italic">Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) </span>[1990] BCLC 760 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Charnley Davies</span>”) for its perceptive articulation of the distinction between unlawful conduct and conduct that is unfairly prejudicial (the UK equivalent to our notion of commercial unfairness) to the petitioner’s interest:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">An allegation that the acts complained of are unlawful or infringe the petitioner’s legal rights is not a necessary averment in a s 27 petition [the equivalent of our s 216]. In my judgement it is not a sufficient averment either. The petitioner must allege and prove that they are evidence or instances of the management of the company’s affairs by the administrator in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial <span class="font-italic">to </span><span class="font-italic">the petitioner’s interests</span>. Unlawful conduct may be relied on for this purpose, and its unlawfulness may have a significant probative value, but it is not the essential factor on which the petitioner’s cause of action depends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167  As the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee </span>stated in summing up the applicable analytical approach, a s 216 action “is appropriately brought where the complainant is relying on the unlawfulness of the wrongdoer’s conduct as <span class="font-italic">evidence </span>of the manner in which the wrongdoer had conducted the company’s affairs in disregard of the complainant’s interest as a minority shareholder and where the complaint cannot be adequately addressed by the remedy provided by law for that wrong”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 It is at this juncture that I should say something about the TCP-related allegations of oppression.

Unfortunately, the Plaintiffs did not expressly address this issue either in their closing submissions or in their further submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Given Joe’s testimony in cross-examination and given the <span class="font-italic">qua member </span>rule, it would appear that the Plaintiffs’ case in oppression vis-à-vis TCP must be that Joe’s rights <span class="font-italic">as a shareholder of AIQ </span>were oppressed because as a shareholder of AIQ, he had certain legitimate expectations – by virtue of the Understanding and Agreement – as to how TCP would be managed. This was the basis on which I approached the Plaintiffs’ TCP-related allegations of oppression, as it appeared to be the only coherent basis on which the Plaintiffs could have pursued their TCP-related oppression claims following Joe’s about-face under cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevance of the Plaintiff’s own conduct to the court’s consideration of whether there was commercial unfairness </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The final aspect of the concept of commercial unfairness which I consider in this section of my written grounds concerns the relevance of the Plaintiffs’ own conduct to the court’s consideration of whether commercial unfairness has been established, and if yes, what reliefs may be appropriate. This issue was relevant in the present case because in respect of several of the Plaintiffs’ allegations of oppressive conduct (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, commissioning and issuance of the Special Audit Report at [432]–[471] below, procuring AIQ to resist payment of Joe’s salary and loans claims at [472]–[502] below), the Defendants’ explanations for some of their actions were premised on Joe having conducted himself in a certain way – including his conduct as a director of AIQ in the period before the 4th to 7th Defendants joined the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng and others </span>[2011] SGHC 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San</span>”), the plaintiff Tan, who held 0.89% of the shares in a company known as “CHH”, brought a suit under s 216 of the Companies Act against the majority shareholder Neo, who held 99.1% of the shares, as well as Neo’s wife. Neo and his wife argued <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that Tan was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches from complaining about oppression of his rights as minority shareholder. Quentin Loh JC (as he then was) noted that since the remedies which Tan was seeking were derived from statute and not from equity, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>position was that laches, or other equitable defences, did not bar Tan’s right to claim for relief under s 216. However, Loh JC pointed out that such a view was too simplistic because although a s 216 claim was statutory in nature, the principles on what constituted oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct were “heavily influenced by considerations of fairness and equity”. In his view (at [103]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since considerations of fairness and equity play a crucial role in an action under s 216, a court should rightly be able to take into account the conduct of all the parties in determining whether there has been unfairness as a whole warranting the grant of relief under s 216(2). After all, fairness is a relative concept. Furthermore, because the court has a very wide discretion in granting such relief, it would only be natural to consider the relative equities of both the minority and majority shareholders in determining the appropriate form of relief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Loh JC (at [104]) also cited with approval the following passage from Robin Hollington QC, <span class="font-italic">Shareholders’ Rights</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2007) at para 7-123 – wherein the author discussed the application of the “clean hands” doctrine in equity in relation to the UK equivalent of s 216:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the petitioner is relying upon traditional equitable principles to establish unfair prejudice, then it appears that the court will apply the general equitable principle that those seeking equitable relief must come to the court with “clean hands”. ... Any misconduct on the part of the petitioner, in so far as it relates to the grounds of unfair prejudice relief, must of course be material to the court’s assessment of the unfairness of the treatment of the minority by the majority and of the relief that ought to be granted to redress any wrong done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Loh JC went on to hold (at [105]) that the court hearing a s 216 action could take into account equitable defences such as laches and the clean hands doctrine in determining whether there has been oppressive conduct and in awarding the consequential relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 While Loh JC was dealing specifically with the equitable defence of laches in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San</span>, the principles which he articulated on the relevance of a s 216 plaintiff’s conduct to the court’s consideration of the plaintiff’s complaint of commercial fairness were clearly not intended to be limited to cases involving laches and/or the clean hands doctrine. As he took pains to point out (at [102]), the inquiry into whether a course of conduct may be characterised as unfair was a “multifaceted inquiry” (citing the CA in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>). Since fairness was a “relative concept”, it made sense that the court should generally be able to consider the s 216 plaintiff’s conduct in determining, firstly, whether the element of commercial unfairness had been made out; and secondly, if this element had been made out, what reliefs would be appropriate to grant the said plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 By way of illustrating his point, Loh JC referred to the English CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Blackmore v Richardson </span>[2006] BCC 276 (“<span class="font-italic">Blackmore</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Blackmore</span>, the petitioner and the two respondents had carried on the business of providing a radio taxi service through a partnership, and later through a company in which they were directors and equal shareholders. The respondents subsequently sold their shares to a third party C, who owned a competing business. The petitioner brought a petition under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985. The unfair prejudice he complained of included the fact that he had been excluded from the company and that his position in the company had been altered from that of being an equal shareholder with the two respondents to that of being a minority shareholder where the majority shareholder was someone with whom he had never had any dealings and who owned a competing business. In the course of the trial, evidence was given to show that some months prior to the respondents’ sale of their shares to C, the petitioner had given them a letter which purported to be an offer for his shares from another taxi company. In fact, the petitioner had forged this letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 At first instance, the trial judge found the petitioner’s conduct in forging the letter to be deplorable, but held that the forgery did not automatically discharge the obligations of good faith which he found to be imposed on the former partners towards each other. On appeal, the English CA held (at [52]–[56]) that the trial judge was “plainly right” to take this position. As the English CA noted, the forgery “had no immediate or necessary relation to the circumstances upon which the petitioner’s entitlement, or otherwise, to relief depended”: “at best”, the forgery was “an episode in the background history”. The trial judge was right to disregard it in his consideration of whether the conditions under s 459 were satisfied. He was also right to disregard it in relation to the question of whether to exercise his discretion to make any, and if so, what order for relief under s 461.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 In <span class="font-italic">Grace v Biagioli</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1222, the company at the centre of the dispute (“Telpro UK”) had issued a total of 100 shares, with the petitioner and the three respondents each having 25 shares in the company. The petitioner and the three respondents were also directors of the company. After things soured between then, the petitioner brought proceedings under s 459 of the UK Companies Act 1985, claiming that that the respondents had decided to distribute profits to themselves alone without his knowledge or consent, and that they had also removed him as a director. He sought an order for the respondents to buy out his shares in Telpro UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 At first instance, the trial judge found that unfair prejudice was established in respect of the failure to pay the petitioner dividends, but not in respect of his removal as director. The trial judge held that the petitioner’s removal as director was not unfairly prejudicial within the meaning of s 459(1) because the respondents had possessed sufficient cause to remove the petitioner. In gist, the petitioner had put himself in a position of actual or potential conflict with his duties as a director by negotiating to acquire a company dealing in the same line of business as Telpro UK. Having found that there was fault on the part of the petitioner, the trial judge held that this (together with a number of other reasons) should exclude the making of a buyout order and instead ordered the company to pay the petitioner a sum of £20,000 plus interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 On appeal by the petitioner, the English CA held (at [69]) that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the petitioner’s conduct had justified his removal as a director. This was because although the petitioner was entitled to take the view that the difference between him and the respondents made it sensible for him to seek out alternative opportunities for the future, the way in which he had done so – in an underhand and secretive manner, and by negotiating the purchase of a related business – would have placed him in a position of conflict with his duties as a director towards Telpro UK. The English CA therefore dismissed the petitioner’s appeal against the trial judge’s finding that his removal as director had not been unfairly prejudicial. At the same time, however, the English CA held that in respect of the relief granted to the petitioner, the trial judge had exercised his discretion under s 461 on too narrow a basis, and the factors which he had considered as reasons for not making a buyout order did not justify the conclusion reached. The petitioner’s appeal against the trial judge’s refusal to make a buyout order was accordingly allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">R A Noble &amp; Sons (Clothing) Ltd </span>[1983] BCLC 273 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Noble</span>”), a small private company was set up by Mr Noble and Mr Bailey to take over a business previously run by Mr Noble. The parties agreed <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that Mr Bailey would invest £10,000 in the venture; that Mr Bailey and Mr Noble would each have 50 shares in the company (with Mr Bailey’s shares being held by a company he controlled (“Anafield”)); that Mr Bailey would bear the expense of fitting out a new shop to be acquired by the company; and that Mr Noble would be responsible for conducting the company’s affairs for which he would receive a salary. The working relationship between the parties deteriorated, however, and contact between Mr Bailey and Mr Noble became less frequent. This culminated in Mr Bailey writing to Mr Noble saying that he wished to sever his connection with the company – and also seeking repayment of the loan made as well as payment for work done on renovations for the shop. Subsequently, Anafield also filed a petition seeking relief (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 75 of the UK Companies Act 1980 for unfair prejudice to its interests. It was alleged that Mr Noble had improperly assumed control of the company and had excluded Mr Bailey from involvement in the company affairs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 In considering whether there was unfair prejudice, Nourse J found that Mr Bailey’s exclusion from management of the company was not unfair because it was to a large extent due to Mr Bailey’s disinterest – and that Mr Noble had simply wanted to get on with the management of the company’s affairs and was not guilty of any underhanded conduct. In particular, Nourse J explained that (at p 291-292 of <span class="font-italic">Re Noble</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to s 75, I certainly think that Mr Noble's conduct, inasmuch as it resulted in the exclusion of Mr Bailey from participation in all major decisions affecting the Company's affairs, could in other circumstances have amounted to conduct unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Anafield, even though the value of its shareholding in the Company may not have been seriously diminished or seriously jeopardised. I entirely agree with Slade J that s 75 cannot be limited to cases of that nature. On the other hand, I have acquitted Mr Noble of any form of underhand conduct. In particular, I acquit him of deliberately deceiving Mr Bailey as to the existence of the substantial overdraft on the Josy Fashions' account. I think that Mr Noble's attitude was that he just wanted to get on with the business without having to consult Mr Bailey about anything upon which he was not forced to consult him. But in all the circumstances of this case, including many to which I have not specifically referred, <span class="font-italic">I do not think that it can be said that Mr Noble's conduct was unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Anafield.</span> In my judgment, the crucial word on the facts of this case is 'unfairly'. <span class="font-italic">It is at this point that Mr Bailey's disinterest becomes a decisive factor.</span> In the end, and by reference to the test propounded by Slade J, <span class="font-italic">I do not think that a reasonable bystander, observing the consequences of Mr Noble's conduct and judging it to have been prejudicial to the interests of Anafield, would regard it as having been unfair. I think he would say that Mr Bailey had partly brought it upon himself.</span> That means that there is no case for relief under s 75. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 To sum up, therefore, the authorities establish that in an oppression claim under s 216 of the Companies Act, the plaintiff’s own conduct may be relevant to the court’s consideration of whether the treatment he complains of is commercially unfair, and also in the court’s consideration of the appropriate relief to be granted in the event commercial unfairness is proven.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Finally, in applying the above principles in its evaluation of an oppression claim, the court should bear in mind the CA’s injunction in <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field </span>that “the law does not condone a tit-for-tat approach to shareholder relations (<span class="font-italic">Ascend Field</span> at [69] citing <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span> at [76]). Both <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field </span>and <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin </span>are instructive in the illustration they provide of conduct which may be regarded as having devolved into a tit-for-tat approach between disputing shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In <span class="font-italic">Ascen</span><span class="font-italic">d Field</span>, one Mr Tee and one Mr Ng had set up AFPL as equal shareholders. Prior to setting up AFPL, Mr Ng and his wife (“Ms Kor”) ran another company (“YFX”). Both AFPL and YFX provided cleaning services to office premises and buildings. Mr Tee’s friend and business partner (“Mr Ching”) controlled certain businesses (“Oxley businesses”), and AFPL was awarded cleaning contracts by the Oxley businesses. Mr Ng was at the material time the sole director. Eventually, Mr Tee claimed to have discovered various lapses in AFPL’s management, which led to the breakdown of the working relationship between Mr Tee and Mr Ng. Mr Tee commenced an oppression suit against Mr Ng, Ms Kor and YFX, claiming that Mr Ng had acted oppressively by <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> diverting AFPL’s contracts, employees and resources to YFX; causing AFPL to make wrongful payments to YFX; removing Mr Tee as a bank signatory; and refusing to declare dividends. In relation to Mr Ng’s conduct in diverting AFPL’s contracts to YFX, Mr Ng and Ms Kor argued <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that they had acted in response to Mr Ching’s conduct in allegedly threatening to close down AFPL and to inform AFPL’s customers to contract with a new cleaning company (at [66] of <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 At first instance, the trial judge found that the five contracts in question were diverted to YFX from AFPL after the relationship between the parties broke down, and after Mr Ching caused the Oxley businesses to divert their contracts from AFPL to a third-party cleaning company. The trial judge held that regardless of such action, Mr Ng “had no excuse to divert the contracts to YFX” (at [67] of <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The CA agreed with the trial judge’s findings on this issue (at [69]). In particular, the CA noted that notwithstanding the breakdown of relations between Mr Ng, Mr Tee and Mr Ching and the alleged threats made by the latter two, Mr Tee and Mr Ching did not have any management control over AFPL and could not have caused it to shut down. The CA held that even if Mr Ching had terminated AFPL’s contracts with his Oxley businesses, Mr Ng “was not precluded from ensuring that AFPL performed its other existing contracts”; and “[a]ny grievances that he had could have been managed through proper means,<span class="font-italic"> </span>such as his continued participation in the share buyout negotiations or by taking legal action against Mr Ching and Mr Tee for their alleged interference with AFPL’s contractual relations”. The parties were agreed that AFPL was set up as a quasi-partnership based on a relationship of mutual trust and confidence between Mr Ng and Mr Tee (at [41]); and that Mr Tee had a legitimate expectation that while YFX continued running after AFPL’s incorporation, Mr Ng would not be in a position of conflict of interest in relation to it (at [49] and [54]). By diverting AFPL’s contracts to YFX, Mr Ng had breached Mr Tee’s legitimate expectations (at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span>, the plaintiff had accepted the second and third defendants’ invitation to join their interior design business (“Ideal Design Studio”) as a director and a shareholder with a 16.67% stake through shares sold to him by the third defendant. Parties had an understanding that the plaintiff would be paid a certain percentage of the profit on every project he brought in or managed. The plaintiff was set a target of bringing in $200,000 in sales within six months, failing which he was to resign as director and sell his shares back to the third defendant at the purchase price. Subsequently, despite failing to meet the targets, the plaintiff refused to resign as director or to sell his shares back to the third defendant. The plaintiff was then removed as a director at an EGM. Subsequently, the defendants incorporated five companies which the plaintiff was excluded from. Each of the five companies had the words “Ideal Design” in its name. The plaintiff found out about these five companies some two years after their incorporation. He commenced oppression proceedings against the second and third defendants, alleging <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>the diversion of business from Ideal Design Studio to the five companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 On the facts, Coomaraswamy J found that the defendants’ “real reason for incorporating the five companies was to divert the revenue, and therefore also the profits, of what would otherwise have been Ideal Design Studio’s business to entities in which the plaintiff had no shareholding and accordingly no legal entitlement to share in the profits” (at [77] of <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span>). While Coomaraswamy J found that the plaintiff’s refusal to sell back his shares was a breach of the understanding between him and the defendants, such conduct on the plaintiff’s part “did not entitle the defendants to approximate the effect of his doing so by incorporating the five companies and diverting business from Ideal Design Studio to them” (at [75]). The diversion of business was not only a breach of the defendants’ fiduciary duties to Ideal Design Studio; it “defeated the plaintiff’s legitimate expectation as a shareholder” and was “grossly commercially unfair to the plaintiff as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio” (at [77]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Before I leave this section on the applicable legal principles, I note the Plaintiffs have argued that I should not take into account Joe’s conduct in determining the existence of commercial unfairness. This was because according to the Plaintiffs, the 3rd to 7th Defendants had failed to plead their reliance on the clean hands doctrine and/or any other equitable defence warranting a denial of relief.

In the first place, the Plaintiffs’ contention that the 3rd to 7th Defendants were seeking to rely on the “clean hands” doctrine was misconceived.

GSS was told AIQ required an additional $3m in funding. Subsequently, sometime “in or around 1 March 2017”, Joe and GSS agreed that together, they would contribute a further $3m in funding to AIQ “on a 1/3 and 2/3 basis respectively”. According to the Plaintiffs, this agreement was reflected in the 1 March 2017 email from Joe to GSS. Both parties’ contributions were to be “treated as loans with an option to convert to equity…at their respective options”; and there was to be “equal” treatment of the two sets of loans. Additionally, Joe proposed – and GSS agreed – that he (Joe) would remain the Chairman of AIQ and continue with his existing remuneration package; and that payment of such remuneration would “continue to be deferred and be treated as shareholder loans to [AIQ]”.

</div>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 I make two points about this shift in the Plaintiffs’ case. First, the Plaintiffs made no attempt to apply for leave to amend their pleadings prior to the filing of closing submissions. It is trite that parties are bound by their pleadings, and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties have not put into issue (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [38]). After all, the function of pleadings is to give one’s opponents fair notice of the case which has to be met and to define the issues which the court will have to decide on so as to resolve the matters in dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 at [61]). If the Plaintiffs had wanted at the close of the trial to put forward a different case on the terms of the Understanding and Agreement, they should have applied for leave to do so and addressed the issue of prejudice to the Defendants. Having chosen not to make any such application, I did not think they should be allowed to put forward in closing submissions a different case from the case presented in their pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Second, even if I were to overlook the Plaintiffs’ procedural lapse on the basis that the Defendants suffered no real prejudice (since their defences would have remained the same whether there were eight express terms or only two in the alleged Understanding and Agreement), the manner in which the Plaintiffs’ change in position was presented in their closing submissions gave rise to even more questions. The Plaintiffs did not acknowledge in their closing submissions this tangible – indeed, significant – change in their case vis-à-vis the terms of the Understanding and Agreement. If anything, they sought to couch the shift in position rather coyly in equivocal terms. Of the six terms which had been pleaded as express terms at paras 19(2)-(5) and 19(7)-(8) of the amended statement of claim, it was said in the closing submissions that they “<span class="font-italic">may not </span>have been expressly agreed”. This apparent refusal to take a firm position on whether the six terms were in fact expressly agreed was disconcerting, to say the least, since it suggested that the Plaintiffs themselves were uncertain about the precise terms alleged to have been expressly agreed between Joe and GSS.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-justify font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">The plaintiffs’ apparent uncertainty as to the circumstances in which the express terms of the Understanding and Agreement were agreed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 This leads me to my next point, and the first of the several reasons why I rejected the Plaintiffs’ claim that there was an Understanding and Agreement concluded between Joe and GSS. As with their case on the express and implied terms of the Understanding and Agreement, the Plaintiffs’ case as to the circumstances in which the express terms of the said agreement were allegedly agreed between Joe and GSS also went through a number of significant changes.

In his AEIC, Joe did not mention any other terms of the Understanding and Agreement being discussed or agreed at the 3 February 2017 meeting. According to the version of events in his AEIC, the agreement about funding which was reached at the 3 February 2017 meeting was “captured in subsequent correspondence between GSS and [Joe]” – “[f]or instance”, the email exchange of 1 March 2017 between GSS and Joe.

I found this unbelievable, firstly, because both were indisputably experienced businessmen who would have known only too well the importance of reducing contracts into writing. Having a written record of the terms they had agreed upon would have been all the more important when they had no prior working relationship and thus no reason to trust each other blindly.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In this connection, I should point out that of all the alleged terms of the Understanding and Agreement, the 2:1 Funding Agreement in particular would have placed both AIQ and Joe in a highly advantageous position, while subjecting GSS to onerous financial obligations. At the time the Understanding and Agreement was purportedly entered into, GSS held only a 4.73% shareholding in AIQ, compared to Joe’s 50.60% shareholding (before the share transfer in October 2017). On the Plaintiff’s case, despite being a minority shareholder, GSS agreed to bind himself to funding AIQ together with Joe on a 2:1 ratio – an arrangement which Joe testified at trial was to carry on “indefinitely”.

</div> This meant that for an indefinite period of time, GSS would bear twice the burden of funding AIQ as compared to Joe, while Joe would stand to gain more than ten times of any upside that GSS would gain in the event of AIQ’s success. This simple calculation did not even account for the roughly 45% of other shareholders in AIQ who were not providing any further funding to AIQ at that point in time and who only stood to gain the upside from any success by AIQ. Given these circumstances, I found it unbelievable – absurd, even – that Joe should have omitted to ensure the 2:1 Funding Agreement was reduced into writing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Further, the Plaintiffs themselves accepted that tensions and disagreements between Joe and GSS surfaced soon after the purported conclusion of the Understanding and Agreement in March 2017. It was not disputed that these tensions and disagreements arose in part from GSS’ dissatisfaction with Joe’s alleged failure to follow through on his promises to transfer to GSS shares in AIQ and in another company called AFAR, even as GSS was continuing to co-fund AIQ. Thus, for example, in an email dated 27 September 2017 from Marcus to Joe and the other directors (which was copied to GSS), Marcus informed Joe that GSS had stopped his funding of AIQ for the month of September 2017 until the “share transfer issues” were “sorted out” between GSS and Joe. In the same email, Marcus expressed worry that AIQ was short of funds to pay suppliers; and he urged Joe to “have a conversation directly with GSS” on the issue of “further funding from GSS” and a “resolution for the share transfers agreement”.

</div> Further, while the Plaintiffs argued that the ratio of the two men’s financial contributions ($100,000 versus $50,000) demonstrated the existence of the 2:1 Funding Agreement, I found no merit in this argument: after all, the fact that GSS had put in funding of $100,000 to match Joe’s $50,000 was equally consistent with GSS’ account of events, in which he had provided two-thirds of AIQ’s funding out of goodwill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 As for the 10 October 2017 (3.39pm) email

</div> from GSS, this too did not assist the Plaintiffs in proving the existence of the 2:1 Funding Agreement, let alone the Understanding and Agreement, when read in the context of the relevant email chain. I summarise in chronological order below the relevant emails:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 9 October 2017 (at 3.15pm), GSS wrote to Joe, thanking him for the transfer of 235,000 AIQ shares to GSS, but also criticising him for not having met his “commitment to equalize [their] shareholdings” by transferring 450,000 shares. GSS also raised potential issues with maintaining AIQ’s localised status vis-à-vis restrictions on share transfers to foreign shareholders;

GSS alluded to the two convertible loans he had given AIQ up to that date; the first being a convertible loan of US$1m, for which he had extended the deadline on Joe’s request); the second being the convertible loan of US$2m, of which $1,846,000 had already been utilised. Noting that the drawdown on his second convertible loan had “been on a ratio of GSS/Joe 2:1”, GSS stated that upon reflection, he “now realized” he had been “over generous”; and that a “much fairer formula [was] to align lending to shareholding interests”. Noting further that he himself held at that stage 315,908 shares versus Joe’s 765,000 shares, GSS stated that the “lending ratio should now be adjusted to GSS/Joe 1:2.42”. GSS also made it clear that this ratio of 1:2.42 was to apply to the next injection of funds which Marcus and Kian Wai were then seeking on behalf of AIQ, such that he would provide $175,438.59, while Joe would provide $424,561.41;

In this email, Joe stated that it was “never [his] intention to give away 50% of [his] shareholding” in AIQ. Joe claimed that this matter had been discussed at the last board meeting and that Leslie had accepted that it was his (Leslie’s) misunderstanding. Joe also alluded to being “down” more than $14m (presumably a reference to losses sustained in his investments) and stated that if he was going to “stand any chance of getting this back”, “handing over 50% of [his] shareholding for $1 [was] never going to work”. Joe then told GSS:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In short, I agreed to transfer approx 25% of my shareholding to assist the company/shareholders and indeed in recognition of your continued funding commitment. As I see it, you agreed to fund an additional $2m earlier this year and I have given you $2m worth of shares back( applying the same discounted valuation I acquired Freer's shares).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Going forward, given that you are contributing to the on going funding on a 2:1 basis, your holding will increase so as to ensure we satay [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>above the 30% local requirement. In addition, I will if necessary sell some of my holding at fair market value to local investors.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Finally, I have been in discussions with Joaquin Rodriguez who holds 12% of the company and would like to sell. He wants $750k( giving an implied valuation of $5.6m) however, I think I can bash him up a little more and get him lower (possibly $400k). I am happy to do this together if of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 I make three points about the above email exchange. First, GSS was clearly of the view that he had the right to change the funding ratio as and when he saw fit. When dissatisfied with Joe’s perceived failure to equalise their respective shareholdings, GSS showed no compunctions about taking steps to change the funding ratio after concluding that a “much fairer formula” was to “align lending to shareholding interests”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 Second, when GSS announced that the funding ratio should be “adjusted to GSS/Joe 1:2.42”, Joe did not protest that GSS had no right to “adjust” the ratio unilaterally. Neither did he point out to GSS that he was breaching the 2:1 Funding Agreement by doing so. Indeed, no mention was made by Joe of GSS’ obligations under the Understanding and Agreement which the two of them had supposedly entered into a mere six months ago. Instead, Joe sought to placate GSS by assuring him that since they needed to ensure AIQ’s local shareholding stayed above 30%, GSS’ shareholding would increase as he continued to fund AIQ on a 2:1 ratio. Joe also offered to get another shareholder to sell his shares to GSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Third, while Joe referred at one point to GSS’ “continued funding commitment”, no mention was made of the express terms of the Understanding and Agreement which – according to the Plaintiffs – formed the basis for this “funding commitment”. It should also be noted that whereas the Understanding and Agreement as pleaded by the Plaintiffs did not provide for GSS to receive a certain percentage of Joe’s AIQ shares in consideration of his agreeing to fund two-thirds of AIQ’s expenses, in his 14 October 2017 email Joe described himself as having “agreed to transfer approx. 25% of [his] shareholding” to GSS “in recognition of [GSS’] continued funding commitment”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242  In light of these three points, not only did the contents of the emails from 9 October 2017 to 14 October 2017 fail to support the Plaintiffs’ case as to the Understanding and Agreement, some of the statements made by Joe himself in these emails were plainly inconsistent with the terms of the Understanding and Agreement (as pleaded by the Plaintiffs).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 I address next the minutes of the board meetings on 21 September 2017, 27 October 2017 and 15 November 2017.

Moreover, the minutes showed the AIQ directors – including Joe – discussing GSS’ proposal that he and Joe should fund the company on a 1:2.42 basis, in line with their respective shareholding; and although Joe expressed disagreement with this proposal, he said nothing about GSS being bound by the Understanding and Agreement to continue funding the company on a 2:1 basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 As for Kian Wai’s email to Joe on 1 December 2017 (10.59am),

</div>
</div> This argument appeared to me to be neither here nor there. Even if GSS had approved the AIQ board’s plans for the setting-up of TCP, this was still fundamentally a very different thing from GSS and Joe expressly reaching an agreement to incorporate TCP for specific purposes. As I have noted, of the latter, there was no evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 I should add that insofar as the above emails in March 2017 touched on Leslie’s proposal for the setting-up of TCP, this evidence actually militated against the Plaintiffs’ assertion that the express term concerning the incorporation of TCP was agreed between Joe and GSS by the time of their 1 March 2017 email exchange. As pointed out earlier, Leslie’s proposal was sent to Joe and GSS via email on 22 March 2017; and it was clear from Leslie’s email summary to GSS on 23 March 2017 that he (Leslie) had discussed the idea for the setting-up of a co-working space with Joe for the first time on 21 March 2017. It was simply not possible, therefore, that Joe and GSS could have agreed on the express term concerning the incorporation of TCP by the time of their email exchange on 1 March 217.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 In sum, therefore, none of the documents collated by the Plaintiffs mid-trial proved to be of any assistance in establishing the existence of the Understanding and Agreement – or indeed, of any of its terms. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(V) <span class="font-italic">the undisputed evidence supported GSS’ version of events rather than the Plaintiffs’ version</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Finally, I found that quite apart from there being no documentary or other objective evidence of the existence of the Understanding and Agreement, the undisputed evidence actually supported GSS’ version of events rather than the Plaintiffs’. In this connection, there were two things which stood out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-7 text-left">(a) There was no cogent reason for GSS to agree to such one-sided terms</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 The first was something I alluded to earlier (at [224]): the highly advantageous position which the alleged 2:1 Funding Agreement would have placed AIQ and Joe in, versus the onerous financial obligations which GSS would have been subjected to. In gist, <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Plaintiffs’ case, GSS was obliged to shoulder two-thirds of the burden of funding AIQ for an indefinite period, despite holding a minority stake of less than 5% at the time, as compared to Joe’s 50.60% stake (before the share transfer in October 2017). Further, although Joe claimed in an email dated 14 October 2017 that he had “agreed’ to transfer 25% of his AIQ shareholding to GSS “in recognition of [his] continued funding commitment”, <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Plaintiffs’ case, the (allegedly) projected transfer of shares to GSS was never made a term of the Understanding and Agreement. In other words, therefore, the 2:1 Funding Agreement worked to GSS’ detriment while substantially benefiting AIQ and Joe himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Given GSS’ experience as a businessman (which the Plaintiffs themselves were at pains to highlight), I found it frankly unbelievable that he would have agreed to such a one-sided and unfavourable contractual term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-7 text-left">(b) Joe failed to bring up the Understanding and Agreement on the numerous occasions when its terms were allegedly breached by GSS</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Secondly, it was telling that despite claiming that GSS would have been bound by the terms of the Understanding and Agreement from March 2017 onwards, Joe failed to bring up the agreement on the numerous occasions when its terms were allegedly breached by GSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 Thus, for example, as seen earlier (at [238]–[240]), when GSS unilaterally declared in his email of 10 October 2017 that the “lending ratio should now be adjusted to GSS/Joe 1:2.42”, one would have expected Joe to remind GSS that the 2:1 Funding Agreement was an express term of their Understanding and Agreement which GSS was bound to comply with until such time as AIQ could achieve financial independence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 Indeed, when Joe’s lawyers brought up the 2:1 funding ratio in their letter to GSS’ lawyers on 23 November 2017,

</div> the narrative which they presented was entirely inconsistent with the Plaintiffs’ eventual case at trial. According to the Plaintiffs, the 2:1 Funding Agreement was one of the express terms agreed between Joe and GSS <span class="font-italic">by March 2017</span> – although, as I noted earlier (as at [218]–[222] above), Joe wavered between claiming in his AEIC that the funding ratio was agreed at their 3 February 2017 meeting and was “captured in subsequent correspondence” such as the 1 March 2017 emails, and claiming in his testimony that the agreement was reached in March 2017 through telephone conversations and text messages. In their letter of 23 November 2017, however, Joe’s lawyers stated that Joe’s “point” was that the 2:1 funding ratio was agreed <span class="font-italic">when “[Joe] delivered some 13% of his shareholding to [GSS] without requiring consideration</span>”.

</div> Indisputably, this transfer of shares by Joe to GSS took place on 3 October 2017, a day after the signing of the Share Transfer Deed. Clearly, therefore, the assertion by Joe’s lawyers that the 2:1 funding ratio was agreed only upon this transfer of shares on 3 October 2017 – and their omission to mention any earlier funding agreement – gave the lie to the Plaintiffs’ case at trial about the Understanding and Agreement having been concluded by March 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Elsewhere, Joe’s lawyers also failed on numerous occasions to bring up the Understanding and Agreement between Joe and GSS when one would have expected them to. Thus, for example, in their letter to GSS’ lawyers on 27 February 2018, Joe’s lawyers brought up Joe’s complaint (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) that the other directors of the AIQ board had diverted the monies advanced by him to payment of “top heavy staff salaries” and “salary increments”.

</div> In particular, the Plaintiffs alleged that the 4th to 7th Defendants had sided with GSS on the issue of the funding ratio and thus allowed GSS to ratchet up the financial pressure on Joe. The 4th to 7th Defendants were also alleged to have involved GSS in many of the critical corporate decisions and actions which they took on behalf of AIQ – and from which Joe was excluded despite his also being a director. The Plaintiffs claimed that based on various emails and text messages, it was clear that GSS had been involved in major company decisions, including the manner by which the company was to progress should funding from Joe no longer be forthcoming. In other words, the 4th to 7th Defendants had treated GSS as a key-decision maker and had simply proceeded in accordance with his instructions.

Whether he is a <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">jure</span>, <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> or shadow director, such a person owes the same duties to the company under the Companies Act and at general law. A shadow director is someone in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a corporation are accustomed to act, even though such a person claims not to be a director (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Prakash JA (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Gryphon</span> at [33], citing <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Rev 3rd Ed, 2009) at paras 7.3 and 7.20). The enquiry as to whether a person is a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> or a shadow director is a question of fact and degree (<span class="font-italic">Gryphon</span> at [33] citing <span class="font-italic">Smithton Ltd (formerly Hobart Capital Markets Ltd) v Naggar</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 939 at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 In <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>, Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) cautioned (at [46]) that in pursuing this enquiry, the courts should not introduce concepts such as “manipulation” and “puppeteering” into the definition of a “shadow director”. As Chan J explained:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 … I find that the introduction of an element of “manipulation” or “puppeteering” into the definition generates more confusion. The rationale for the concept of a “shadow director” was, in all likelihood, to circumvent the difficulty of imputing directorship to an individual who had not put himself out as a director of the company and had not acted as if he was on equal standing with the <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>directors, yet exerted real influence on the corporate decisions of the company. To call such an individual a “director” would create a schism in one’s ordinary understanding of a “director” since, in most cases, such an individual would have taken the greatest caution not to come across as being on par with the <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>directors and would not be perceived as a director at all – whether <span class="font-italic">de jure </span>or <span class="font-italic">de facto</span>. Yet, as someone who was directing the directors in important corporate decisions, the definition of a director had to be extended so that the law could hold him responsible for his actions. This is where the concept of a “shadow director” is helpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Consequently, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if a board of directors exercising independent judgment finds itself consistently complying with the alleged shadow director’s instructions or directions, such an individual is as much a shadow director as one whose instructions or directions are consistently complied with by a board which does not exercise independent judgment but simply abides by or follows those instructions or directions</span>. This might be counter-intuitive since the term “shadow director” has over time, acquired a pejorative meaning – with phrases such as “lurking in the shadows”, “puppet master”, “cat’s paw” tacked to it. However, it must be borne in mind that incorporating such additional requirements into the definition would defeat the rationale of the “shadow director definition” (which is an extended definition of “director”) as “it would be all too easy for the [board of] directors to recite that, having considered the ‘advice’ of the alleged shadow director, they had on their judgment decided to follow that advice” (N R Campbell, “Liability as a Shadow Director” [1994] JBL 609 at 613). Indeed, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the raison d’être of this concept is to ensure that those who are responsible for the important corporate decisions of a company are held to task regardless of what they are called and their motives or manner in making such corporate decisions</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">48 The test is, thus, simple: is there sufficient evidence showing that the directors of a corporation are accustomed to act on the directions or instructions of that person? If yes, then the status of a shadow director may be imputed to him. Whether the board has exercised its decision independently or otherwise is irrelevant</span> and has to be so: otherwise, the rationale underpinning the “shadow director” concept would be subverted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 In <span class="font-italic">Parakou Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and other appeals</span> [2018] 1 SLR 271 (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span>”), the CA – citing Chan J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club </span>– held that in order for the court to find that a person was a shadow director, what was needed was a “discernible pattern of compliance”; and “occasional departures from the pattern would not detract from this finding” (<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49] citing <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span> at [45]). In <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span> (at [49]), the CA upheld the trial judge’s finding that one C C Liu was a shadow director of the company Parakou. It was held that Liu’s role as patriarch of the family business did not preclude a finding that he was a shadow director. The CA noted, moreover (at [49]), that there was evidence of Liu having instructed the other directors on certain matters such as appointing a lawyer to represent Parakou and of Parakou’s senior manager having asked the “bosses” (including Liu) to instruct him on how to proceed. Liu himself had also confirmed that he had a “certain influence” over Parakou. These instances, in the CA’s view, showed that Liu had played more than an advisory role in Parakou.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">The evidence did not support a finding that GSS was a shadow director of AIQ and TCP</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 In applying the above principles to the present facts, I should first highlight that GSS was correct in pointing out that the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions presented a different case on GSS’ purported status as a shadow director from the case pleaded in their amended statement of claim. In their amended statement of claim, the Plaintiffs had pleaded that GSS “gradually usurped control” of the AIQ board “through subtle and covert manipulation, influence and control”, by dint of getting his “family members and other directors loyal to [him]” appointed to the board.

Instead, they claimed that it was “<span class="font-italic">not</span> the Plaintiffs’ case that the 4th to 7th Defendants were put on the board to serve GSS”, but rather, that as GSS effectively became “the only funder of AIQ” after proposing a new funding ratio to Joe’s detriment, the 4th to 7th Defendants “had to bow to [GSS] and dance to his tune as AIQ, and presumably TCP, would otherwise have to cease operations”.

In respect of TCP, Kian Wai expressly highlighted to GSS and Joe that of the $1.2 million in fresh funds being requested, “a final cost of $295k” was needed to “settle all TCP setup and renovation costs”, while “20k per month till Dec” was budgeted for the ramping up of TCP’s marketing in the initial three months to acquire members”. In the same email, Kian Wai also reminded GSS and Joe that he had previously informed them that they needed “to inject funds to TCP to clear all outstanding balances previously paid by AIQ on behalf of TCP which [was] amounting to $500k”; and he put forward a proposal as to how the fresh funds would be split as between AIQ and TCP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 It should also be noted that in an email dated 1 December 2017,

</div> Kian Wai had (pursuant to Joe’s request) updated Joe on the total amounts disbursed by him and GSS for the period 1 January 2017 to 30 November 2017, pursuant to their convertible loans with AIQ. Kian Wai reported to Joe that for the said period, Joe had disbursed a total of US$930,714 while GSS had disbursed a total of US$1,569,198. These sums comprised monies injected by both men to meet the funding needs of AIQ and TCP, pursuant to the various requests from Kian Wai and Marcus in the preceding months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 The irresistible inference which arose from the contemporaneous documentary evidence was that Joe knew very well where his loans to AIQ were going: he knew part of the funds were being used to pay for TCP’s expenses, and he raised no objections when informed of such usage. In the face of the documentary evidence, there was simply no merit in his argument that the idea for TCP came about after he (and GSS) had provided convertible loans to AIQ and that the convertible loans were thus intended only for AIQ’s benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 Indeed, as the 4th to 7th Defendants pointed out, under cross-examination Joe himself admitted that Kian Wai and Marcus had always informed him via email as to how the funds that he and GSS were being asked to put in were intended to be applied. Joe also admitted that he was “always told that insofar as part of those funds were going to be used for TCP’s purposes,… what those purposes were and approximately how much would be used”.

</div> In fact, despite Joe’s demand for TCP to “become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIQ” as previously agreed upon, it was Joe himself who failed to transfer his TCP shares to AIQ – a fact which in my view underscored the insincerity of his complaints about the 4th to 7th Defendants’ alleged interests in TCP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">309 Given the above circumstances, AIQ would have controlled more than half of the voting power of TCP – both before and after the transfer of shares from the 4th to 7th Defendants to AIQ, which would make TCP a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIQ pursuant to s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Companies Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, a corporation shall, subject to subsection (3), be deemed to be a subsidiary of another corporation, if – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">   (a) that other corporation –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (i) controls the composition of the board of directors of the first-mentioned corporation; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (ii) controls more than half of the voting power of the first-mentioned corporation; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">   (b) the first-mentioned corporation is a subsidiary of any corporation which is that other corporation’s subsidiary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 Since TCP was a subsidiary of AIQ, s 163 did not apply to loans made from AIQ to TCP by virtue of s 163(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) This section does not apply –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) to anything done by a company where the other company (whether that company is incorporated in Singapore or otherwise) is its subsidiary or holding company or a subsidiary of its holding company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 Further and in any event, even assuming there was a breach of s 163 of the Companies Act, the onus remained on the Plaintiffs to demonstrate that this constituted commercially unfair conduct vis-à-vis Joe and/or Thames.

In this respect, the Plaintiffs failed entirely to explain how a breach of s 163 was commercially unfair – and thus oppressive of <span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">Plaintiffs’</span> rights. In my view, given Joe’s own conduct, and in particular, his clear knowledge of the loans from AIQ to TCP as well as the lack of any objections thereto, the Plaintiffs had no grounds whatsoever to complain of commercial unfairness arising from any (purported) breach of s 163.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 In sum, for the reasons stated at [297]–[311], I rejected the Plaintiffs’ claim of oppression arising from the allegedly wrongful diversion of funds from AIQ to TCP and the allegedly unauthorised loans.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Wrongful denial of information to Joe from AIQ and TCP</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Plaintiffs’ position</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 The next allegation of oppressive conduct which I address is the Plaintiffs’ allegation that Joe was wrongfully denied his right to receive financial information on AIQ, TCP and the progress of these companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 In this connection, the Plaintiffs claimed that by virtue of the Understanding and Agreement, Joe had a right to receive full financial information on AIQ, TCP and the progress of these companies.

</div> Like Joe, GSS too was not allowed to subscribe by setting off loans owed by AIQ to him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) My Decision</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The law relating to rights issues in oppression claims</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 Before I address the Plaintiffs’ various allegations, I first outline the legal principles which govern the conduct of rights issues in the context of oppression claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">337 As a starting point, <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd v OSIM International Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 729 (“<span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span>”) is instructive as to when the conduct of a rights issue may be held by the courts to have given rise to commercial unfairness. In <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span>, the 1st plaintiff (“TWG”) sued the 1st to 6th defendants for oppressive conduct under s 216 of the Companies Act, while the 2nd plaintiff (“Manoj”) sued the 1st to 3rd defendants for conspiracy to injure. The 2nd defendant (“Ron Sim”) was the founder, chairman and CEO of the 1st defendant (“OSIM”) and a director of a company (“TWG Tea”) and the 4th defendant (“Paris”). Paris was wholly owned by OSIM and a shareholder of TWG. The 3rd defendant (“Taha”) was a director and the CEO of TWG Tea. The 5th defendant (“Peng Soon”) was a director of Paris and TWG Tea, while the 6th defendant (“Peter Lee”) was a director of OSIM, Paris and TWG Tea. TWG Tea was first incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TWG. Eventually, Ron Sim through an investment company (“EQ Capital”) invested in TWG. Paris and OSIM became shareholders in TWG Tea with TWG.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">338 At an EGM on 17 December 2013 (which TWG and Manoj chose not to attend), TWG Tea shareholders approved a resolution presented by the board calling for a rights issue of up to 77,000 shares. Ron Sim subsequently asked TWG’s directors to subscribe to the rights issue, but TWG did not accept the new shares allocated to it pursuant to the rights issue. OSIM and Paris together subscribed for the entire 77,000 shares. This resulted in OSIM controlling 69.9% of the shares in TWG Tea (up from 53.7% previously). Soon after, TWG commenced minority oppression proceedings. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia,</span> they claimed that Ron Sim had proposed, and OSIM and Paris had approved, the rights issue which was not for commercial reasons and was instead intended to dilute TWG’s shareholding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">339 In dismissing the Plaintiffs’ claim that the rights issue was oppressive, Chua JC (as he then was) noted at [183] (citing the CA’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> at [122]) that the issue of shares for any reason other than to raise capital – for instance, to dilute the voting power of others – amounted to a breach of fiduciary duties by the directors of the company and could be set aside by the court. Further, if directors representing majority shareholders abused voting powers by voting in bad faith or for a collateral purpose, oppression could be said to have been established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">340 Chua JC further held that a rights issue would be unfair within the meaning of s 216 of the Companies Act if (a) there was no commercial reason to raise capital through a rights issue; or (b) the dominant purpose of the rights issue is to dilute non-subscribing shareholders. He noted that these were the two most common – albeit non-exhaustive – grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">341 With respect to (a), Chua JC held (at [185]) that where there was no commercial reason to raise capital through a rights issue, a rights issue would be unfair to shareholders even if the pricing of the rights issue was fair and reasonable. Because a rights issue required shareholders to invest more money in the company by subscription to the rights issue, or face dilution to the value and voting power of their shareholding, shareholders “were entitled to expect that they [would] not be subject to this dilemma unless the company [had] a commercial reason to have a rights issue”. In practice, where there was no commercial reason for a rights issue, it was invariably found that the purpose of the rights issue was to dilute the shareholding of non-subscribing shareholders: see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span> at [127]; <span class="font-italic">Sharikat Logistics Pte Ltd v Ong Boon Chuan </span>[2014] SGHC 224 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span>”) at [188]; <span class="font-italic">Maxz Universal </span>at [108].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">342 As Chua JC pointed out, the question of whether there was a commercial reason for a rights issue would be a finding of fact in every case. Generally, there could be no commercial reason for a rights issue “unless (a) the company [was] in need of funds, and (b) raising such funds via a rights issue, rather than other means of financing such as bank loans, [was] a reasonable option”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">343 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span>, Chua JC found that there were commercial reasons to raise capital through a rights issue. First, there was a $5.6m loan from OSIM that was due to be repaid within a month’s time, failing which the loan interest would jump to a higher rate (at [140]–[146]). TWG also had to repay $6m to UOB at around the same time that the OSIM loan fell due. The repayment of the OSIM loan and the UOB loan thus constituted a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reason for the rights issue (at [148]–[149]). In addition, there were other legitimate expenses for which reasonable amounts had been budgeted; and on top of these legitimate payments due from TWG Tea, TWG Tea also needed to fund its expansion plans, which would cost approximately $10.4m (at [153]–[154]). In the circumstances, Chua JC found that there were commercial reasons for the rights issue (at [155]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">344 In <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan</span><span class="font-italic"> Enterprises Pte Ltd v Yak Thye Peng </span>[2019] SGHC 149 (”<span class="font-italic">Swee Wan</span>”), two brothers (“YTP” and “YTL”) fell out over the control and management of two family-owned companies (“SWE” and “SWT”). The daughter of YTL (“YCW”) was also a party to the proceedings. One of the issues was whether a rights issue conducted by SWE in June 2017 amounted to oppression of YTP’s rights as a shareholder. In gist, following approval given at an EGM on 7 June 2017, a rights issue of 1,771,910 ordinary shares at par value of $1 per share was offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings (at [36]). YTP was of the view that this rights issue was simply an attempt to dilute his shareholding in SWE as YTL and YCW knew that YTP would not be able to meet his obligations in respect of the rights issue. YTP had written to YTL’s and YCW’s lawyers threatening legal proceedings. The lawyers replied that the rights issue was necessary to ensure that SWE could meet its liability in respect of a loan from ABN AMRO Bank and that it was not an attempt to dilute YTP’s shareholding. After the rights issue was carried out, YTP’s shareholding in SWE shrank from 40% to 20.79% (at [37]–[39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">345 On the facts, Hoo J found that the ABN AMRO loan had been taken out for business purposes; that it had been negotiated and managed by YTP; and that it had been secured by SWE’s properties as well as a personal guarantee from YTP. Unfortunately, the loan facility was cancelled on 28 March 2017, following which the loan had to be repaid within three months. YTL and YCW had nothing to do with this cancellation. Hoo J found that YTL was under no obligation to use funds that he was personally entitled to for the discharge of SWE’s liability to ABN AMRO (at [111]). Nevertheless, YTL and YCW had taken reasonable steps to find alternative means of funding, including <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> unsuccessful attempts to obtain re-financing from four different banks (at [107]–[110]). Hoo J rejected YTP’s allegation that “there was short notice given to him, that no proper explanation for the number of shares to be issued had been given, and that no valuation was done to support the share price” (at [112]). She accepted YTL’s and YCW’s explanation that the short notice was due to the urgency of the situation, and that this urgency had in part been caused by YTP’s behaviour in doing nothing when he first received notice of the cancelled loan. The rights issue was at par value and each shareholder was entitled to subscribe for shares. Although on the face of it, the quantity of shares issued appeared to be far in excess of what was required for paying off the ABN AMRO loan, Hoo J accepted YCW’s explanation that there was insufficient time to call for multiple rights issues if the first did not raise the $900,000 outstanding to ABN AMRO, and that YCW had operated on the assumption that only YTL would be willing to subscribe for more shares so as to raise the amount required (at [113]–[115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">346 As to the valuation of the shares, Hoo J held that a lack of any serious attempt to ascertain the market value of shares alone did not demonstrate a lack of good faith (at [116]). While YTP complained that the price of the rights issue could have been set lower than book value, Hoo J pointed out that a lower share price would also mean that more shares would have to be issued to raise the same amount of funds should YTL be the only one to subscribe; and this would actually have resulted in a more serious dilution of YTP’s shareholding. Further, Hoo J noted YCW’s evidence that a rights issue would be conducted at less than current value so that existing shareholders could have a chance to participate, and so as to incentivize them to do so. YTP himself had no satisfactory explanation as to why he had not subscribed for the shares if he thought that the price was low. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">347 Ultimately, therefore, Hoo J found that the decision to carry out a rights issue was made for a genuine commercial reason, <span class="font-italic">viz</span> to raise capital for SWE – and not to dilute YTP’s shareholding as he claimed (at [116]–[117]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">348 In <span class="font-italic">Sharikat</span>, there was a dispute amongst the shareholders of the 5th defendant (“TG-SN”). The shareholders were the plaintiff (“Sharikat”) with 40% of the shareholding in TG-SN, the 4th defendant (“TGDPL”) with 51% of TG-SN’s shareholding, and the 3rd defendant (“KYL”), with the remaining 9% of TG-SN’s shareholding. TG-SN was set up to tender for and to undertake a development project at Banyan Drive (“the Project”). Sharikat brought an oppression action, claiming that one “OBC” (the sole director and controlling shareholder of TGDPL) had used TGDPL’s position as majority shareholder of TG-SN to oppress Sharikat as a minority shareholder. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia, </span>Sharikat claimed that following its commencement of the action, OBC had sought to raise a rights issue on the basis that TG-SN needed to repay a construction loan and to pay for future expansion. Sharikat countered that there was no urgency to repay the loan; that TG-SN was a single purpose vehicle set up to develop and manage the Project; and that the true purpose of the rights issue was to dilute Sharikat’s shareholding in TG-SN (at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">349 Prakash J (as she then was) accepted that TG-SN was incorporated as a single purpose vehicle. As such, there could be no question of future projects to be undertaken without the consent of Sharikat; and by the time the rights issue was proposed, this consent was very unlikely to be given since Sharikat and TGDPL were on bad terms by then. In other words, “there was little, if any, prospect of Sharikat agreeing to expand the business” of TG-SN. OBC must have realised that Sharikat would not want to invest additional funds in the company, and thus he could not have sincerely considered that Sharikat would participate in the rights issue in order raise funds for TG-SN to undertake further business (at [181]). Furthermore, Prakash J did not accept that OBC could have truly believed TG-SN was at that time experiencing a cash crunch. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia, </span>he had neglected to accept another bank’s offer of a reduced interest rate, which would have saved TG-SN money. As at end-2010, TG-SN also had cash reserves of approximately $700,000; all the units in the Project were occupied; rental was forthcoming; and the company’s cash position had been constantly improving while its liability decreased. In the circumstances, Prakash J concluded that there was no valid commercial reason for the rights issue and that it was aimed at diluting Sharikat’s shareholding (at [182]–[188]). The calling of the 8 September 2011 EGM and the passing of the resolution for a rights issue were accordingly held to be oppressive actions on the part of TGDPL and OBC vis-à-vis Sharikat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">350 In any inquiry into the existence (or not) of commercial reasons for a rights issue, it should be remembered that even if there are good commercial reasons for the rights issue, it is a fact that every rights issue will dilute the shareholding of those shareholders who choose not to subscribe it (<span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group </span>at [188]). As Chua JC pointed out in <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span>, a non-subscribing shareholder cannot complain about the mere fact of dilution because there can be no general expectation that the shareholding of a company will remain constant. Neither can a shareholder complain about the mere fact that the price is too low. However, a shareholder <span class="font-italic">is </span>entitled to not be unfairly treated. A rights issue “would be unfair if its dominant purpose is to dilute the non-subscribing shareholder”; and such a dominant purpose would be an improper purpose which the court would not permit (at [188]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">351 Further, as Chua J observed in <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group, </span>the intention to dilute non-subscribing shareholders often has to be inferred. The absence of commercial reasons for a rights issue is one obvious indicator of such an intention. Another strong indicator is a low issue price where there is no good commercial reason for the low price. This is because the lower the issue price, the more shares will be issued and this in turn leads to a greater dilution of the non-subscribing shareholder’s shareholding (at [190]). As for the majority’s knowledge that a minority shareholder cannot or may not take up the issue, this factor does not necessarily mean that the rights issue is unfair – but it will be a factor which the court will consider (at [190], citing <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [76]). At the end of the day, the question whether a company is in need of funds – as well as the question of whether raising funds via a rights issue is a reasonable option – are matters for the company’s management; the court will be slow to question a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>management decision honestly arrived at (at [186] of <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span>, citing <span class="font-italic">Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd </span>[1974] AC 821 at 832; and <span class="font-italic">Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 In this connection, as Chua JC observed (at [193]–[194]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">193 Using the dilutive effect for the purpose of encouraging shareholders to subscribe to a rights issue is conceptually different from using the dilutive effect for the purpose of diluting non-subscribing shareholders. It may be difficult in some cases to differentiate between the two on the evidence. However, this difficulty should not stop the court from recognising and giving effect to the distinction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">194 The distinction may be better explained by considering two different factual scenarios. In the first scenario, the majority shareholder wants to increase his shareholding and either knows or hopes that the minority will not take up the rights shares. He then prices the rights issue at the low end of a reasonable range in order to increase the dilutive effect on the non-subscribing shareholder. In the second scenario, the majority shareholder is not looking to increase his shareholding and would like all shareholders to contribute proportionately to the financing of the company by subscribing to the rights issue. The rights issue is again priced at the low end of a reasonable range but this time the intention is to incentivise the shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue. In my view, the two scenarios deserve very different treatments even though the dilutive effect in both cases may be similarly disadvantageous to the non-subscribing shareholder. The decision for the low issue price in the first scenario would be unfairly prejudicial to the non-subscribing shareholder. However, I see no reason why the decision in the second scenario should constitute unfairly prejudicial conduct. Since there is a commercial reason for the rights issue, it would not be wrong for a majority shareholder to expect all shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue, or to price the rights issue low so that shareholders will be incentivised to subscribe in order to avoid the dilutive effect of not subscribing. It would also not be wrong, in the second scenario, if one of the reasons for the low issue price is to make it more attractive for the majority shareholder to take up the shares not taken up by the non-subscribing shareholder, so that the company is able to raise the full amount of financing needed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Whether there were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> commercial reasons for the Rights Issue </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">353 Bearing in mind the principles I have outlined at [336]–[352] and having examined the evidence adduced, I found that there were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> commercial reasons for the Rights Issue to be carried out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">AIQ was in urgent need of funds within a very short timeline</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">354 First, it was not disputed that at the material time, AIQ had only a small sum of money left in its bank account.

Second, I considered it entirely unreasonable for the Plaintiffs to suggest that the 4th to 7th Defendants should have approached GSS first and exhausted GSS’ portion of the funding under the 2:1 Funding Agreement first, before approaching Joe. Given the fraught relationship which existed between Joe and GSS by early 2018, such a one-sided approach would in all likelihood have resulted in GSS digging in his heels and refusing to heed any of the 4th to 7th Defendants’ pleas for funding. By this stage, the 4th to 7th Defendants had already had made several attempts to persuade GSS and Joe to agree on a workable funding arrangement – and these attempts had been rebuffed by both men.

As Chua JC pointed out in <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span> (at [199]), as a matter of law, it was not incumbent upon directors to consult shareholders on the terms of the rights issue. Although Chua JC noted that it would be useful in some circumstances for consultations to be held, any decision whether to do so was best left the directors to take. In the present case, given that the 4th to 7th Defendants had genuine commercial justification for the Rights Issue, the fact that they proceeded in spite of Joe’s objections could not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>be a ground for finding the Rights Issue commercially unfair to Joe. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">369 Similarly, on the facts of the present case, the 4th to 7th Defendants should not be faulted for the speed at which the Rights Issue was carried out. As I highlighted earlier, by January 2018 AIQ had already failed to pay staff salaries for the month of January, and its bank balance stood at less than $5,000. All attempts to persuade Joe and GSS to agree on a new funding arrangement and/or to raise a bridging loan from shareholders had failed. There was thus good reason for the Rights Issue being carried out swiftly to raise funds for AIQ. In this connection, it may be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan,</span> Hoo J also rejected the minority shareholder’s complaints about the “short notice” given of the rights issue as she found that there was a genuine reason for urgency in that case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">Not allowing Joe to set off his convertible loans with the shares issued under the Rights Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">370 Next, the Plaintiffs argued that the Rights Issue was oppressive because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) GSS was permitted to and did subscribe to the Rights Issue by setting off part of the loans owed by AIQ to GSS, whereas Joe was not allowed to do so.

First, the objective evidence available showed that GSS had not in fact been permitted to subscribe to the Rights Issue by way of set-off against his loans to AIQ. The Plaintiffs have not produced any scrap of evidence to substantiate their claim. At one point, the Plaintiffs alleged that a debt of $302,400 from GSS to AIQ dated 14 February 2018 was used to set off the amount payable for his subscription to shares in the Rights Issue which was supposed to close on 23 February 2018.

</div> However, this allegation was completely baseless. On the evidence before me, there was no “set-off”: the sum of $302,400 from GSS to AIQ was always intended to be payment for GSS’ subscription for shares in the Rights Issue; and the only reason why the monies came in before the close of the Rights Issue was because Kian Wai had requested early payment from GSS in order to allow the company to pay its staff their overdue salaries before the Lunar New Year: see <span class="font-italic">eg </span>the email exchange between Kian Wai and GSS dated 13 February 2018 showing Kian Wai’s request for early payment to meet AIQ’s January payroll for its staff,

What the Plaintiffs were really saying was that although Joe himself had elected not to participate in the Rights Issue, the 4th to 7th Defendants should nevertheless have let him convert his existing loans to equity,

</div> so as to allow him to “equalise” his shareholding vis-à-vis GSS’ increased shareholding. This argument was obviously premised on the assumption that Joe had the right under the alleged Understanding and Agreement <span class="font-italic">not </span>to have his shareholding diluted (as an <span class="font-italic">implied term </span>of the Understanding and Agreement) (at [208] above). Absent the Understanding and Agreement, there was no basis for any expectation on Joe’s part that he should be allowed to “equalise” his shareholding with GSS, in the event GSS increased his stake by participating in the Rights Issue when Joe did not do so. I add that based on the contemporaneous documentary evidence, Joe was in fact afforded an equal opportunity during the launch of the Rights Issue to subscribe for new shares in AIQ in proportion with his shareholding.

</div> Had he chosen to do so, his shareholding in AIQ <span class="font-italic">would not have been diluted</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">373 Finally, it should be pointed out that Joe’s request on 5 March 2018 to convert his loans to equity ran contrary to the very objective of the Rights Issue. The whole point of the Rights Issue was to raise fresh capital for AIQ. By the time the Rights Issue was launched, AIQ was already in a parlous financial position. It was challenging, to say the least, to get investors to risk more of their money by injecting fresh capital into the company. If the 4th to 7th Defendants had allowed Joe to convert his loans into equity, there was nothing to prevent GSS or any other shareholders from demanding the same treatment the next time AIQ tried to raise funds through another rights issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(III) <span class="font-italic">Total amount of the Rights Issue being only $302,400, which would have only lasted AIQ for slightly more than a month</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">374 Next, the Plaintiffs took issue with the fact that the Rights Issue raised only $302,400.

</div>; and further rights issues would then be needed to raise more funds – something GSS and Kian Wai had confirmed under cross-examination. The Plaintiffs’ position appeared to be that since the Rights Issue had produced a less than stellar result in terms of the amount raised, this proved that the Defendants’ intention all along in conducting the Rights Issue must have been to dilute Joe’s shareholding rather than to raise funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">375 I did not find any merit in the above argument. A less than ideal result in terms of the amount raised by the Rights Issue could not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>suggest a dominant intention on the 4th to 7th Defendants’ part to dilute Joe’s shareholding. Regard must be had to all the other surrounding circumstances. These include <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>the reasons for the rights issue; whether there were other fundraising options explored before the launch of the rights issue; and whether there were steps taken to incentivise shareholders to participate in the rights issue. AIQ’s management had the responsibility <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> to ensure sufficient commercial reason to launch a rights issue, decide on an appropriate price, and carry out the rights issue in a proper manner. Whether or not the rights issue would ultimately be successful in achieving the objective of raising funds was something far out of the control of management. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">376 Further and in any event, it made no sense for the Plaintiffs to cavil at the less than stellar result of the Rights Issue. Had the Rights Issue been much more successful and raised more money, Joe’s shareholding in AIQ would have been diluted to an even greater extent. As Hoo J observed in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan, </span>YTP’s argument that the rights issue in that case was wrongly-priced and that it could have been set at below book value was a double-edged sword: more shares would have to be issued to raise the same amount of funds, resulting in an even more serious dilution of YTP’s shareholding. The same reasoning applied in the present case vis-à-vis Joe.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(IV) <span class="font-italic">Low price of the rights issue and lack of independent valuer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">377 In addition to complaining about the speed at which the Rights Issue was purported conducted, the Plaintiffs contended that the “heavily discounted price” of the Rights Issue and the lack of a valuation by an independent valuer also demonstrated a dominant intention on the Defendants’ part to dilute his shareholding.

In the present case, AIQ’s urgent need for funds necessitated prompt action in the conduct of the Rights Issue. In any case, since a rights issue could generally be used to incentivise shareholders to invest in the company (under the appropriate circumstances), it made sense that management was able to dictate, to a certain extent, the price of such a rights issue to create that incentive – independent of the market value of the shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 As Chua JC observed in <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group</span> (at [194]), in a scenario where there is a commercial reason for a rights issue, it “would not be wrong for a majority shareholder to expect all shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue”, or to “price the rights issue low so that shareholders will be incentivised to subscribe in order to avoid the dilutive effect of not subscribing”. In the present case, it must be remembered that all through 2017 up until the launch of the Rights Issue, Joe and GSS had been the two primary funders of AIQ through convertible loans. The other shareholders, who collectively held around 30.92% of AIQ’s shareholding

</div> This meant that Joe and GSS, as the sole funders of AIQ, had been the only two shareholders taking on the significant risk of losing the funds that they had been injecting into AIQ since the start of 2017 – while the other shareholders got to enjoy the benefits of their funding. Since by January 2018 Joe and GSS were no longer willing to fund the company, the only alternative left to the 4th to 7th Defendants was to raise funds from all shareholders through a rights issue, such that instead of having only one or two shareholders bear all the risk of funding AIQ, all shareholders would now be expected to do so equally in proportion to their stake in AIQ. In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the 4th to 7th Defendants to expect all shareholders (including the other 30.92% who had not been funding the company) to fund AIQ via subscription, <span class="font-italic">and</span> to seek to incentivise them to do so in order to avoid being diluted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">380 Following from this, given AIQ’s urgent need for funds, it was also reasonable for the 4th to 7th Defendants to price the Rights Issue at a low price, so as to make it more attractive for shareholders to subscribe to the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">381 The Plaintiffs also complained that at a price of 28 cents a share, if the Rights Issue had been fully subscribed, this would have resulted in each AIQ share having a valuation of $1.1626, as compared to a pre-Rights Issue valuation of $9.106 per share.

</div> Further, as GSS ultimately subscribed to only a limited number of shares, the Plaintiffs claimed that he must have calculated the specific number of shares he needed to acquire a majority stake of 50.04%, and that this behaviour demonstrated that the Rights Issue was really a cheap way for GSS to acquire majority control at Joe’s expense.

If the price was a bargain for GSS, it would have been a bargain for Joe as well.

First, there was never any interim bridging loan given to AIQ, as GSS and Joe could not come to an agreement to provide such a facility to AIQ.

</div> In other words, in substance, there was no practical difference between the two clauses since there were no interim bridging loans in existence for the time period specified in the new clause. Second, the Plaintiffs have tried to argue that the italicised words in the new clause were added by the 4th to 7th Defendants in order to preclude Joe from subscribing to the Rights Issue by setting off his previous convertible loans against the subscription price. This was a specious argument. Even if the italicised words had not been added, Joe would still not have been able to subscribe to the Rights Issue by setting off his loans to AIQ.

According to the Plaintiffs, the Defendants had implemented a strategy (which the Plaintiffs termed the “Incapacitation Strategy” in their closing submissions) to put pressure on Joe in order to incapacitate him from participating in the Rights Issue. The Plaintiffs also argued that the Defendants knew Joe was very unlikely to participate in the Rights Issue since it would have provided funding for only a short period, after which Joe would still have been asked to fund the company together with GSS on a 1:2.42 basis.

This meant that not only was the allegation never put to the 4th to 7th Defendants who had already given evidence by then, counsel for the Defendants had no opportunity to cross-examine Joe about this allegation.

As a starting point, since the Plaintiffs were the ones who were alleging that the Defendants had developed the Incapacitation Strategy in order to incapacitate Joe from participating in the Rights Issue and thus ensure the dilution of his shareholding, the burden lay on the Plaintiffs to prove this allegation on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> at [58] and <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span> at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">399 In attempting to prove their case, the Plaintiffs relied on a series of emails between the 3rd to 7th Defendants in the period between December 2017 and February 2018, with particular emphasis on Kian Wai’s email of 18 January 2018

Only in the event that the audit issues were not dealt with to the satisfaction of the auditor would the 4th to 7th Defendants then “decide the next course of action” (presumably to remove Joe as a director).

It should be noted that Joe did not respond to Kian Wai’s email to retort that there had been no earlier conversation in which they had run “several scenarios”, nor had he given Kian Wai any “instructions” on these scenarios – which one would have expected him to do had he been seeing this information for the first time in Kian Wai’s email. This evidence demonstrated that rather than trying to prevent Joe from participating in the Rights Issue, the 4th to 7th Defendants (or at the very least Kian Wai and Marcus), were hopeful that Joe would participate in the Rights Issue – and that was why they met with Joe to discuss the Rights Issue with him and to “run” various scenarios for him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">405 Taken in totality, therefore, Kian Wai’s evidence appeared to me to be of little, if any, assistance to the Plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">406 Further, there was no evidence to show that the 3rd to 7th Defendants took any steps to execute Kian Wai’s proposed five-step strategy.

There was no dispute that step 1 – <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the securing of an interim loan before the launch of the Rights Issue – was never executed.

</div> also indicated that even before the Rights Issue was launched on 30 January 2018, GSS’ concerns had shifted to the larger objective of getting Joe out of AIQ and eventually Singapore, by lodging complaints to the authorities about Joe. For instance, GSS suggested that complaints would have to be lodged “against [Joe] in the way he runs the company as Executive Chairman”. This was quite different from what the Plaintiffs characterised as the Incapacitation Strategy, which involved using the audit issues to put pressure on Joe and thereby hamper his capacity to participate in the Rights Issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">413 Although in cross-examination GSS apparently agreed that he did proceed with Kian Wai’s proposed five-step strategy, this was on the basis that he had made payment for the shares taken up in the Rights Issue in lieu of providing an interim loan to AIQ. Following the launch of the Rights Issue on 30 January 2018, GSS had – at Kian Wai’s request – made early payment for his share subscription on 13 February 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div> Two points need to be made about this. First, this early payment by GSS on 13 February 2018 for his share subscription could not have been part of Kian Wai’s proposed five-step strategy, because Kian Wai’s proposed five-step strategy had called for interim loans to be secured for AIQ <span class="font-italic">before </span>the launch of the Rights Issue, so as (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) to provide the 4th to 7th Defendants with funds to continue investigating the audit issues and piling legal pressure on Joe regarding those issues. Second, as I noted earlier, there was nothing sinister about this early payment by GSS for his share subscription: as Kian Wai explained, the Rights Issue was intended to raise the funds required for the urgent payment of operational expenses including overdue staff salaries.

The 4th to 7th Defendants’ intention, therefore, was to go ahead with the Rights Issue; and from their perspective, if Joe was innocent and had nothing to fear, he would probably participate in the Rights Issue; whereas if he did not participate, it would probably indicate that something was amiss.

If anything, Leslie’s evidence indicated that the 4th to 7th Defendants were waiting to see how Joe would respond to the Rights Issue as they believed that his response would be an indication of guilt – or lack thereof – in relation to the audit issues.

As I noted earlier, not every instance of unlawful conduct is unfair, just as not every instance of lawful conduct is fair (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span> at [100] citing <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>at [85] and <span class="font-italic">Re Saul </span>at 19; see also <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan </span>at [102]). From the earlier summary of caselaw in this area (at [145]–[158] above), the authorities are clear that in order to discern whether there was commercial unfairness, the court first has to consider what the measure of fairness is. In this instance, the nub of the Plaintiffs’ complaint of oppression in this instance was not simply that there were procedural irregularities in Joe’s removal as a director <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Rather, the nub of their complaint was that Joe should never have been removed as a director, that he had a right under the Understanding and Agreement to participate in the management of both companies, and that his removal from the boards was a violation of that right.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">428 In this connection, as I have found that there was no Understanding and Agreement between Joe and GSS (at [290] above), it followed that there could not have been any violation of Joe’s right to participate in the management of both companies: he never had such a right to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">429 Further and in any event, even leaving aside the Understanding and Agreement, neither procedural irregularity complained of was as egregious as the Plaintiffs tried to suggest. In respect of the alleged breach of Article 70 of AIQ’s Constitution, it should be pointed out that Joe could just as easily have been removed by the 4th to 7th Defendants through a normal resolution (by virtue of Article 73 of AIQ’s Constitution), which read as follows:

In particular, Joe’s failure to give the company’s auditors satisfactory answers on earlier transactions had led to the company being unable to finalise its financial statements for FY 2014 and FY 2015. I deal with the evidence in question in more detail at [449]–[456] below, but at this juncture, it suffices for me to note that the 4th to 7th Defendants were not without justification in removing Joe as a director. In this connection, regard may be had to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Swee Wan</span>. In that case, the plaintiff YTP had relied on his removal as director as one of the grounds for claiming oppression. Hoo J found that YTP’s removal as director did in fact involve breaches of several articles of the company’s constitution, including articles which stipulated a specific procedure for the retirement of directors. However, she held that these breaches were not so egregious as to render YTP’s removal as director commercially unfair. In addition, she noted that two other shareholders of the company had made allegations against YTP in the context of court proceedings. In her view, whatever the merits of these allegations, there was some basis for the other directors YTL and YCW to be concerned about YTP’s prior management of the company, especially in terms of the financial management. Accordingly, Hoo J did not find YTP’s removal as director to be unjustified. I would apply a similar reasoning in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">431 In respect of the alleged breach of Article 51(2) of TCP’s constitution, Joe’s own position was that TCP was supposed to be a wholly owned subsidiary of AIQ – and this was also borne out by the objective documentary evidence (at [308]–[311] above). Joe himself failed to honour this agreement, in that he failed to transfer his TCP shareholding to AIQ even though he held his TCP shareholding on trust for AIQ. In the circumstances, Joe had no basis for subsequently complaining about TCP proceeding with the 29 March 2019 AGM despite his (Joe’s) refusal to attend the AGM. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Special Audit Report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">432 I next address the Plaintiffs’ claim of oppression vis-à-vis the Special Audit Report.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Plaintiffs’ position</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">433 In gist, the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case was that the commissioning and issuance of the Special Audit Report constituted an act of oppression by the 3rd to 7th Defendants because the “real motive” behind the Special Audit Report was to cast aspersions on Joe before AIQ’s shareholders;

According to the Plaintiffs, the 4th to 7th Defendants commissioned and issued the Special Audit Report in order to support GSS’ “objective” of disabling Joe from participating in the Rights Issue, by preventing him from subscribing for the Rights Issue via a set-off of his outstanding loans and salary. GSS’ agenda was also said to have included damaging Joe’s business reputation and ultimately driving him out of the companies and out of Singapore

</div> According to Mr Tan, this was the first time that TRS Forensics had dealt with AIQ – save that he knew Leslie prior to TRS’ engagement for the Special Audit. This was because Leslie was previously the CEO of a former client of TRS Forensics, and they shared some mutual friends. Notwithstanding this, Mr Tan claimed that this relationship with Leslie did not in any way affect the manner in which TRS Forensics carried out the Special Audit. In any case, TRS Forensics’ main point of contact with AIQ for the Special Audit was Kian Wai, and not Leslie.

</div> Put simply, there did not appear to be any “enhancement” of the Medical Application which could have justified its repurchase at such a high price. Moreover, although Joe claimed that the transaction had been reversed and the money refunded to AIQ, there was no evidence of any such refund having been given.

This was anomalous, since AIQ first needed to purchase the websites and technology from Filmfunds before it could sell them to Cinime. Further, pursuant to its agreement with Filmfunds, AIQ was required to pay US$2,000,000 to Capital West, a company in which Joe and Carl Johan were concurrently directors whilst still directors of AIQ.

Documentation for these transactions was woefully lacking, and the transactions were potentially tainted by conflicts of interests as they involved payments to entities owned by parties who were at that time also directors of AIQ. In the circumstances, it was clear that the 4th to 7th Defendants had valid reasons to inquire into these transactions. This was all the more so considering that these transactions had already been flagged by AIQ’s auditors and were the reason why the financial statements for two consecutive years could not be finalised.

</div> In laying out in the letter his objections to the Rights Issue, Joe alluded to outstanding issues with the FY 2015 audit. According to Joe, these outstanding FY 2015 audit issues impacted “the status of [AIQ’s] financial accounts as well as ownership and/or commercialisation of existing intellectual property rights”; and until these issues were resolved and the FY 2015 accounts signed off, shareholders had to be kept “properly informed of these ongoing matters”.

Critically, both the FY 2014 and the FY 2015 financial statements had not yet been finalised as of April 2018 because the outstanding audit remained unresolved. This indicated that there were indeed serious underlying problems with the accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">454 Since there was a pressing need for the 4th to 7th Defendants to resolve AIQ’s audit issues and since there had already been prolonged delay in the finalisation of the FY 2014 and FY 2015 accounts, it was both reasonable and commercially acceptable for the 4th to 7th Defendants to decide to call for the Special Audit. I noted, moreover, that even as the 4th to 7th Defendants were discussing the possibility of a Special Audit, they were clear that a Special Audit would be launched only if Joe continued to fail to respond satisfactorily to the auditor’s queries.

Nothing in any of these emails suggested that the Special Audit was to be carried out improperly, unfairly or in a manner prejudicial to Joe. While it is true that GSS expressed the hope in an email to Kian Wai dated 27 May 2018

</div> that this would be “the first step that [would] take Joe to prison”, the statement appeared to me to be an instance of GSS venting his spleen, as opposed to being evidence of some plan or campaign among the 3rd to 7th Defendants to trump up false charges against Joe using the Special Audit. As I pointed out earlier, there was abundant evidence that the outstanding audit issues and the consequent impasse in the finalisation of AIQ’s financial statements were the reasons which drove the 4th to 7th Defendants to commission the Special Audit Report. Indeed, as noted earlier (at [451]), Joe himself had emphasised in his letter of 31 January 2018 that the outstanding audit issues were impacting the company accounts and the ownership/commercialisation of the IP rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">457 As seen earlier (at [171]–[195]), the authorities are clear that in oppression proceedings under s 216 of the Companies Act, the court is entitled to take into account the conduct of the minority shareholder in determining whether the acts of oppression he complains of are actually commercially unfair. I add that nothing in the evidence before me suggested the commissioning of the Special Audit Report was part of a “tit-for-tat” approach to shareholder relations (see <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field</span> at [69] and <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span> at [76].). Given that the outstanding audit issues concerned transactions in which Joe had been involved and/or to which he had been privy, it was logically inevitable that the auditor conducting the Special Audit would have to consider <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> whether there had been any wrongdoing on Joe’s part. The fact that TRS Forensics eventually reported several instances of potential wrongdoing by Joe could not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> suggest that the Special Audit Report must have been commissioned for an improper purpose. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Plaintiffs’ criticisms of the accuracy of the Special Audit Report</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">458 In their attempt to show that the Special Audit Report was filled with malicious falsehoods, the Plaintiffs argued that the following matters cast doubt on the accuracy of the report:

</div> They did not – and Mr Tan was consequently deprived of the opportunity to explain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">462 Second, while the Plaintiffs charged that Mr Tan should have interviewed other persons such as Carl Freer and the HR staff working in AIQ at the time of the transactions – it was not clear what precisely the Plaintiffs hoped to achieve with this accusation. As I noted earlier, it was not put to Mr Tan that TRS Forensics had been negligent or biased in the preparation of the report. Nor was it put to the 4th to 7th Defendants that they had somehow concealed material witnesses from TRS Forensics or denied TRS Forensics access to material witnesses. There was no evidence that AIQ even had access to these persons or knew of their whereabouts at the time of the Special Audit. In other words, the Plaintiffs could not establish any reason for their avowed disquiet over the witnesses purportedly overlooked by TRS Forensics. In contrast, Mr Tan’s clear evidence on the stand was that when TRS Forensics was carrying out the investigations, interviews had been conducted with “all the so-called balance staff in AIQ”, while the “rest all had left” (presumably, the staff which the Plaintiffs claimed should have been interviewed).

Mr Tan testified that he stood by the findings in the Special Audit Report, which were “the result of detailed and careful review of documents and information” and were in no way at all “malicious, misleading, groundless and inaccurate”.

</div> Since the point of the Special Audit was to get to the bottom of AIQ’s audit issues, the 4th to 7th Defendants must be free to get TRS Forensics to conduct an investigation into areas which had been found problematic – so long as it was done in an independent and impartial manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">465 Fifth, the Plaintiffs’ complaints about TRS Forensics’ alleged failure to give proper consideration to the Share Transfer Deed had no merit either.

</div> In my view, there was nothing untoward in the special auditor refusing to take documents at face value and looking for independent verification of their contents. Indeed, if TRS Forensic had chosen simply to take the documents presented to them at face value without inquiring further, such passivity would surely have been a ground for doubts as to their independence and professionalism. Regardless of what the Share Transfer Deed might have stated to be the status of AIQ’s past transactions (in clauses 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4 of the Share Transfer Deed), TRS Forensics was entirely justified in proceeding with their own independent investigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">466 Sixth, CAD’s decision to take no further action on AIQ’s police report

First, the AIQ shareholders had previously at the 28 May 2018 EGM approved a resolution to appoint an independent third-party to conduct a special audit to review the company’s accounts for the financial years ending 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 – and for the results of such a special audit to be made known to the shareholders.

</div> It was only reasonable that the shareholders would be updated in due course on the results of the Special Audit <span class="font-italic">per</span> the approved resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">469 Second, as explained previously (at [451] above), the audit issues were a major source of concern not only for the 4th to 7th Defendants, but also for some AIQ shareholders. As such, it made sense for the 4th to 7th Defendants to update shareholders about the findings of the Special Audit. In his 31 January 2018 letter to AIQ’s board of directors, Joe himself had taken the position that it was important to keep the AIQ shareholders “properly informed” of the outstanding audit issues with the FY 2015 accounts.

Instead, their position was that since there were grounds to believe that Joe had breached his fiduciary duties to AIQ and caused AIQ to enter into transactions which were to its financial detriment, there were valid reasons to resist immediately paying off Joe’s loan claims.

The Plaintiffs did not dispute that these debts which were the subject of the statutory demands were legitimate debts owed to GSS by AIQ and TCP. Instead, the Plaintiffs tried to argue that the 4th to 7th Defendants should have used the Secured Patents to reduce or discharge the debt amount claimed in GSS’ statutory demands. I found no merit in this argument, since the evidence showed that the Secured Patents had failed to generate any monetary returns or value from the time of their international filing on 7 September 2017

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">519 As I noted at the outset (at [511] above), the Plaintiffs pleaded in their amended statement of claim that the winding-up of AIQ and TCP constituted a breach of the Understanding and Agreement – but failed to plead any express or implied term which precluded GSS from applying to wind up the companies. This point was also not explained in the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions. In any event, I have found that the alleged Understanding and Agreement did not exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">520 Instead, the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions showed that their claim of oppression in this instance was premised on some notion of commercial unfairness stemming from the 4th to 7th Defendants’ duty as directors to act in the best interests of AIQ and TCP as well as its shareholders and creditors; in other words, that they were entitled, as shareholders of AIQ and TCP, to expect that (a) the Secured Patents would not be misappropriated, and (b) the two companies would not be “wrongfully” wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">521 As to (a), such an expectation would clearly be incapable of providing a sufficient basis for finding commercial unfairness even if it were breached. I would draw a parallel between the Plaintiffs’ position in this case and the position of the plaintiff/respondent Mr Ng in <span class="font-italic">Suying Design.</span> In <span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span>, Mr Ng had complained <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that Ms Tan (the majority shareholder and director) had made wrongful payments to herself, and that her conduct as such amounted to a breach of his legitimate expectation as a shareholder that the company’s funds would not be siphoned away. The CA held on appeal that Mr Ng had no basis for any expectations as to how the company would be managed “apart from the basic expectations a shareholder may legitimately hold” (at [112]). The CA continued (at [113]–[114]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">113 …..(T)hese baseline expectations do not provide a sufficient basis on which to find that Mr Ng has suffered a distinct personal injury which would amount to commercial unfairness. To find otherwise would … suggest that <span class="font-italic">any </span>misappropriation of moneys by a director would constitute a distinct injury to a shareholder. This would be too broad a construction of the framework the Court of Appeal set out in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>and make impermissible inroads into the proper plaintiff rule. This simply cannot be the case. Further, the breach of this expectation would be remedied by the recovery of the misappropriated moneys by the company in a corporate action. The Companies Act provides s 216A for this purpose.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114 As such … while Mr Ng may have been entitled to expect that [the company’s] funds would not be siphoned away, the breach of this expectation did not in itself constitute a distinct injury under s 216 of the Companies Act. In any event, <span class="font-italic">even if </span>there was a distinct injury, it does not necessarily follow that it would be commercially unfair to Mr Ng if the breaches are not remedied. The claim in respect of the Gratuity Payment [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the alleged wrongful payments made by Ms Tan to herself] therefore should not have been brought under s 216. This is not to say that there was no wrongdoing, but rather, that any such wrong was one done to the company, and should therefore have been pursued under a different cause of action – such as a derivative action under s 216A…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">522 In the same vein, in the present case, the Plaintiffs’ expectation that the Secured Patents would not be misappropriated could not be said to be more than a shareholder’s basic expectation, which – even assuming they were able to prove misappropriation – was insufficient basis “on which to find that [the Plaintiffs had] suffered a distinct personal injury which would amount to commercial unfairness”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">523 As to (b), it was not disputed that TCP was always meant to be wholly owned by AIQ, notwithstanding that Joe himself held on to the TCP shares in his name. It was also not disputed that insofar as TCP shares were held in any individual’s name, that individual was understood to be holding the shares on trust for AIQ (as at [308] above). Bearing this in mind, it will be seen that the winding up of AIQ and TCP affected all shareholders of AIQ equally, in the sense that each shareholder stood to lose their investment in AIQ. Since <span class="font-italic">all</span> AIQ shareholders were affected by the alleged wrong done to AIQ, there was no distinct personal injury suffered by Joe on which he could base a claim under s 216. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">524 Further and in any event, the Plaintiffs’ claim at (b) would be barred by the reflective loss principle. As I alluded to earlier (at [159]–[167]), the reflective loss principle states that where the minority shareholder’s loss is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company which would be made good if the company were able to and did enforce its rights, the proper party to recover that loss is the company, and not the shareholder (<span class="font-italic">Suying Design</span> at [30]). Therefore, in the context of the winding-up of AIQ and TCP, Joe had no basis for complaining about his financial interests having been prejudiced by the winding-up of AIQ and TCP. His financial interests as shareholder were <span class="font-italic">subject entirely to the company’s fortunes</span>. As a shareholder of AIQ, Joe bore<span class="font-italic"> </span>the risk of the vicissitudes of corporate life, just like any other shareholder; and these risks included the risk that the business could fail. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the Plaintiffs were justified in complaining that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had deliberately brought about the two companies’ financial woes and engineered their wrongful winding-up, this was a matter to be taken up by the liquidators against the 3rd to 7th Defendants. It would be an abuse of process for the Plaintiffs to be allowed to bring an oppression claim under s 216 for what would essentially be corporate wrongs (<span class="font-italic">Suying Design </span>at [31] citing <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span> at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The 4th to 7th Defendants made significant efforts to drive AIQ’s business and to raise funds for AIQ</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">525 As a corollary to their allegations about the oppressive effect of the winding-up of the two companies, the Plaintiffs alleged that the 4th to 7th Defendants made little to no effort to drive AIQ’s business and/or to raise funds for AIQ, thereby leading AIQ into financial ruin and eventual liquidation. Again, of course, the legal burden of proving this allegation fell on the Plaintiffs, who also bore the initial evidential burden. I found that the Plaintiffs were unable even to marshal enough evidence to meet their evidential burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">526 In gist, the Plaintiffs relied on a number of emails which – according to them – showed GSS and Kian Wai discussing the option of liquidating AIQ and starting a new company with the patents in GSS’ hands.

</div> However, while it was true that GSS and Kian Wai did discuss <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the option of liquidating AIQ and starting a new company to utilise the Secured Patents, these discussions were not the primary focus of the emails. In fact, these emails constituted persuasive evidence that even as at July 2019, the 4th to 7th Defendants were still putting in effort to advance AIQ’s business interests. For example, the email of 3 July 2019 which the Plaintiffs cited actually showed Kian Wai asking GSS to withdraw the letter of demand dated 19 June 2019 that GSS had served on AIQ, so as to allow the AIQ board time to pursue opportunities “that will generate positive cash flow for the company”. GSS subsequently acceded to Kian Wai’s request and withdrew the 19 June 2019 letter of demand.

If there had in fact been such connivance on the part of the 4th to 7th Defendants, they would scarcely have bothered to ask GSS to withdraw his 19 June 2019 letter of demand, nor would they have bothered to continue their efforts to keep AIQ afloat. Indeed, there were numerous emails to show the amount of effort which the 4th to 7th Defendants were still putting into trying to develop AIQ’s business and to raise funds, even as at July 2019.

</div> GSS must have conspired with the 4th to 7th Defendants to strip AIQ of the Secured Patents and to transfer these to Scanto instead, with the view to commercialising the Secured Patents without Joe’s involvement. On the Plaintiffs’ case, it must follow that in order to misappropriate the Secured Patents for GSS’/Scanto’s benefit, GSS and the 4th to 7th Defendants would have facilitated the winding-up of AIQ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">530 I found the above argument to be devoid of merit. The contemporaneous evidence (see [354] above) showed that even before Scanto was incorporated, AIQ was already in dire financial straits (including for example being unable to pay staff salaries <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">January 2018</span>); and that instead of hastily throwing in the towel and winding up the companies, the 4th to 7th Defendants had all along been working diligently to develop the business as best they could (see [526]–[528] above). In fact, there was also evidence to show that at certain points in time when AIQ’s funds were running low, the 4th to 7th Defendants had deferred payment of their own salaries or fees.

</div> Given that AIQ as a start-up had not turned a profit since incorporation and appeared instead to have accumulated substantial losses, it was clear that there was never any guarantee that AIQ would be successful. Even prior to the 4th to 7th Defendants joining the company, AIQ had already been chalking up substantial losses in the years between 2014 and 2017 when Joe was in charge of the company. In short, this was not a situation where a successful company was run aground by rogue directors. Rather, AIQ was simply a company that had never found the proper traction for its business to take off. Notably, the Plaintiffs’ expert valuer Mr Andrew Ross (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Ross</span>”) accepted in cross-examination that if he had not been “instructed [that] the actions of the [3rd to 7th Defendants had] compromised the ability of AIQ to achieve commercialisation of its IP”, and if he had not worked on the basis of such an assumption, he would have agreed that “there may be other reasons why AIQ may have succeeded or failed”. These reasons could include <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> “the technology or the market… not [being] there or not quite ready”.

Instead, <span class="font-italic">injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As the CA in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>explained (at [101]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A claimant in an action for unlawful means conspiracy would have to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted or directed at the claimant. It is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be a likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct. Injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself.</span> As Lord Hoffmann said in <span class="font-italic">OBG</span> (at [42] and [62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is necessary to distinguish between ends, means and consequences. If someone knowingly causes a breach of contract, it does not normally matter that it is the means by which he intends to achieve some further end or even that he would rather have been able to achieve that end without causing a breach. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the <span class="font-italic">Lumley v Gye</span> tort, there must be an intention to procure a breach of contract. In the unlawful means tort, there must be an intention to cause loss. The ends which must have been intended are different. … But the concept of intention is in both cases the same. In both cases it is necessary to distinguish between ends, means and consequences. One intends to cause loss even though it is the means by which one achieved the end of enriching oneself. On the other hand, one is not liable for loss which is neither a desired end nor a means of attaining it but merely a foreseeable consequence of one’s actions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lesser states of mind, such as an appreciation that a course of conduct would inevitably harm the claimant, would not amount to an intention to injure, although it may be a factor supporting an inference of intention on the factual circumstances of the case. In <span class="font-italic">Lonrho plc v Fayed</span> [1990] 2 QB 479 at 488–489 Woolf LJ observed that the requisite intent (for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means) would be satisfied if the defendant fully appreciated that a course of conduct that he was embarking upon would have a particular consequence to a claimant but nonetheless decided to pursue that course of conduct; or if the defendant deliberately embarked upon a course of conduct while appreciating the probable consequences to the claimant. In our judgment, this is inconsistent with the requirement that intention must be shown. It is simply insufficient in seeking to meet the element of <span class="font-italic">intention</span> to show merely that there was knowledge to found an awareness of the likelihood of particular consequences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">549 As for a conspiracy by lawful means, this is established when two or more persons combine together with the aim of injuring the plaintiff, resulting in damage (<span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [37] (citing <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span>)). The key requirement which a plaintiff needs to show is that there was a “predominant purpose” by the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff. The tort of conspiracy by lawful means has this distinctive mental element because it is precisely this predominant purpose to injure which renders the conduct of the defendants, which would otherwise have been lawful, unlawful or illegitimate: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> at [15.057] citing<span class="font-italic"> Wu Yang Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [77]. It bears noting, however, that a predominant purpose is not the same as intention. This is illustrated by the following example (<span class="font-italic">per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span> (at [49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Second, there was the “predominant purpose” requirement.

His predominant purpose, however, is not to break the window, although he must have <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to break it so as to achieve his main purpose. Thus, a predominant purpose is not the same as intention: see also <span class="font-italic">Mckernan v Fraser </span>(1931) 46 CLR 343 at 399–400.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">550 As to what could constitute a predominant purpose to cause injury, this was discussed by the court in <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent Logistics Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd and others </span>[2014] 4 SLR 1208 (“<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent</span>”). The plaintiffs in that case were part of a group of companies that held the master tenancy of a state-owned plot of land at the former Bukit Timah Turf Club (the “Site”). The landlord was the Government of Singapore which acted through the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”). The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants (the previous master tenant of the Site and two of its directors) had conspired to injure the plaintiffs leading up to the handover of the Site from the defendants to the plaintiffs. The court had to determine, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether there was a predominant purpose on the part of the defendants to cause damage to the plaintiffs. The court noted at ([56]) that in most cases of conspiracy, it was difficult to prove that the “conspirators intended to cause damage to a claimant because the acts committed pursuant to the conspiracy” would usually also benefit the conspirators. This, however, was not a difficulty on the facts. Insofar as the proof of conspiracy and the requisite mental element was concerned, that was typically to be inferred from the objective facts (<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>at [67]). In <span class="font-italic">SH Cogent,</span> the following facts led the court to conclude that there was a predominant purpose to injure: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the transcripts of a meeting held on 1 December 2011 showed that the defendants threatened to injure the plaintiffs unless the plaintiffs were willing to provide the defendants with adequate compensation (<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>at [66], [69] and [85]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the defendants persistently pressured the subtenants and licensees to vacate the Site by 31 January 2012. This was done despite SLA’s express request that the defendants facilitate a smooth transition in the handover to the plaintiffs (<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>at [66], [105] and [106]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Third, the court found that the defendants did not genuinely believe that they were legally obliged to carry out reinstatement work arising from the lapse of a written permission dated 19 August 2010 which was issued by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (<span class="font-italic">SH Cogent </span>at [66], [116], [151] and [152]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiffs’ position</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">551 The Plaintiffs pointed to the following unlawful acts which they claimed the 3rd to 7th Defendants had conspired to commit.

This was also said to be a breach of the term that GSS would not, whether by himself or through the 4th to 7th Defendants, perform any act which would result in the substantial dilution of Joe’s shares in AIQ.

This was said to be a breach of the Understanding and Agreement, a breach of the Share Transfer Deed and Joe’s employment contract.

As for the contention that Joe’s exclusion from the management of the two companies constituted oppressive conduct, I have also found in the context of the oppression claim, in any event, that Joe’s removal from the boards of these two companies was not oppressive (see [427]–[431]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">557 I should highlight that one of the Plaintiffs’ arguments was that in the context of their conspiracy claim, their reference to Joe’s exclusion from day-to-day management of AIQ and TCP encompassed more than Joe’s removal from their boards of directors.

This would not by any stretch of imagination amount to Joe being “excluded from the day-to-day management of AIQ and TCP”. I should add that on the evidence before me, a good number of the requests made by Joe appeared to require AIQ to carry out extra work in order to produce the documents or information requested – including, for example, Joe’s request for the “cash-flow projections for AIQ in respect of the VRT”, as well as accompanying details and descriptions of funds transferred from AIQ to TCP such as “date, amount, method of transfer”, and “who had authorised and made these transfers”. From the evidence in the agreed bundles submitted at trial, it did not appear that these were documents which were already readily available within AIQ. In any event, since the Plaintiffs had waited until closing submissions to put in their “summary”, they were the ones who had deprived Kian Wai (and the other Directors) of the opportunity to clarify whether all the documents listed in the “summary” were documents which already existed at the time of Joe’s requests. In <span class="font-italic">Mukherjee Amitava v DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1054 (“<span class="font-italic">DyStar Global</span>”), the Court of Appeal agreed (at [37]) that the right to inspection under s 199(3) of the Companies Act would extend only to accounting and other records “that are, at the material time, kept by the company and are therefore <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">existence</span>” [emphasis in original] and that the provision “does not contemplate or call for the <span class="font-italic">generation and creation of new documents</span>” [emphasis in original].

For example, following Joe’s request on 11 December 2017 for the records of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the “expenses for human resources” of AIQ and TCP for the preceding 12 months, Kian Wai worked with AIQ’s office manager to retrieve the records and sent these to Joe by the end of the same day.

</div> what the Plaintiffs failed to point out was that these emails only told part of the story. The 4th to 7th Defendants did not dispute that they had at one point tried unsuccessfully to persuade Joe to agree to the funding ratio of 1:2.42 proposed by GSS. However, this simply formed part of their various efforts to keep the funding flowing for AIQ. When it became clear that Joe and GSS would not accept each other’s proposed funding ratio, the 4th to 7th Defendants tried to find a compromise by urging both men to consider funding AIQ in the interim on a 1:1 ratio (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>in equal proportions). Thus for example, on 18 November 2017, Kian Wai had proposed that both Joe and GSS fund AIQ on a “50:50” basis.

In this connection, the observations of the court in <span class="font-italic">Baker, Samuel Cranage v SPH Interactive Pte Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC 238 (“<span class="font-italic">Baker</span>”) were helpful (albeit not to the Plaintiffs’ case). In <span class="font-italic">Baker</span>, the court found that there was nothing unlawful in the defendant directors’ approach to the question of the plaintiffs’ access to information: the directors had simply resisted the request for information, and followed through after an order was made. The court held (at [73]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">An application under CA s 199 is readily allowed by the court and so it proved in Mr Baker’s case. It is another matter altogether however to treat the company’s resistance to such an application as an act of oppression. It has not been established that the application was resisted in bad faith, as opposed to, for example, legitimate concern about the scope of the documents sought. Moreover, I accept the defendants’ contention that any prejudice to the plaintiffs was eliminated upon SSTG’s compliance with the order obtained by Mr Baker. I note further that the application under CA s 199 was both commenced and concluded while these minority oppression proceedings were afoot. I am not able to find that resistance to this application establishes or fortifies the plaintiffs’ case.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">572 In similar vein, in the present case, there was no evidence of bad faith on the 4th to 7th Defendants’ part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">573 To recap therefore, for the purposes of the unlawful conspiracy, the Plaintiffs were unable to prove that there was wrongful denial of Joe’s right under s 199 Companies Act and/or that his right under s 199 was denied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">574 Further and in any event, in respect of both the unlawful and lawful means conspiracy claims, for the reasons set out at [563], the Plaintiffs were unable to prove that there was a <span class="font-italic">combination</span> of the <span class="font-italic">3rd to 7th</span> Defendants to deny Joe’s right under s 199 and/or that they acted to resist his exercise of such right with the predominant purpose of injuring him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Wrongfully removing Joe as a director of AIQ and TCP in order to prevent him from conducting an investigation into why a Rights Issue was needed to raise further funds for AIQ</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">575 The next act which the Plaintiffs claimed was performed in furtherance of an agreement between the 3rd to 7th Defendants was the alleged wrongful removal of Joe as a director of AIQ and TCP.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Unlawful means conspiracy</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">Whether the removal of Joe as a director of AIQ and TCP was unlawful conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">576 In respect of the claim in unlawful means conspiracy, the element of unlawfulness relied on by the Plaintiffs related to the procedural irregularities allegedly committed by the 4th to 7th Defendants in removing Joe from the boards of AIQ and TCP.

The statement that “[s]o far every proxy form is supportive of our resolution” was explained by the very next bullet point which stated, “[w]e do not have any objection vote on our proposed resolution, except for the re-election of Joe”. This latter bullet point thus revealed that the proxy voting forms received by AIQ “so far” (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>as at 26 May 2018) indicated support for all the resolutions which were to be put forward at the EGM on 28 May 2018 – except for the resolution calling for Joe’s re-election: in other words, there had been proxy voting forms which indicated objections to Joe’s re-election. The next bullet point then stated that Joe’s proxy Lucius had voted in favour of “every resolution” (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>including the resolution for Joe’s re-election), except for the resolution to complete the acquisition of TCP which Lucius abstained from voting on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">582 In short, it would appear that Kian Wai’s email of 26 May 2018 – far from being a “battle plan” put forward to GSS and the other Directors for their agreement – was simply an update to the others of what AIQ’s lawyers had advised was likely to happen at the 28 May 2018 EGM, given the proxy votes received by that stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">583 This would explain the first line in GSS’ email reply on 27 May 2018.

</div> The vague – even perfunctory – line “[t]hank you and [g]ood luck” was hardly indicative of agreement to and/or endorsement of a plan to remove Joe from the AIQ board. If GSS had indeed combined and agreed with the 4th to 7th Defendants to remove Joe from the AIQ board at the EGM, this would necessarily have entailed GSS using his majority voting power at the EGM to vote against Joe’s re-election – in which case GSS would surely have acknowledged the virtually certain outcome of the proposed vote. As for the second line (“[h]opefully this is the first step that will take Joe to prison”), this appeared to be a reference to the draft resolution authorising the re-elected board to appoint an independent special auditor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">584 I add that I did not think there was anything sinister in Kian Wai updating GSS on the information received from AIQ’s lawyers. By mid-2018, GSS was effectively the sole funder of AIQ; and it would not have been unreasonable for Kian Wai to wish to keep him informed of what the company’s lawyers had said about the upcoming EGM. The critical question here was whether – quite apart from informing GSS of what the lawyers had said – Kian Wai and the other directors were seen to have combined with GSS to effect Joe’s removal from the board; and as I have explained, the Plaintiffs were unable to prove this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">585 In respect of Joe’s removal from the TCP board, there was no evidence at all to support an inference that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had combined and agreed to remove Joe from the board. The Plaintiffs essentially submitted that an <span class="font-italic">inference</span> should be drawn of such a combination because removing Joe from the TCP board must have required <span class="font-italic">concerted</span> action on the part of GSS and 4th to 7th Defendants.

</div> No evidence was proffered in support of this submission; and I declined to draw the inference argued for. The fact that the 4th to 7th Defendants had concluded it was in TCP’s interest to remove Joe from its board and the fact that AIQ eventually voted against Joe’s re-election were not enough in my view to justify the conclusion that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had combined to remove Joe from the TCP board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">586 The above findings at [580]–[585] applied to both the unlawful means and lawful means conspiracy claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(III) <span class="font-italic">Whether GSS and 4th to 7th Defendants had the intention to cause damage or injury to Joe </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">587 Finally, even if I were to assume for the sake of argument that the Plaintiffs were able to prove the element of combination between the 3rd to 7th Defendants, I found that they were unable to prove that the 3rd to 7th Defendants acted with the intention to cause damage or injury to Joe. It will be recalled that the test for such intention requires proof that that “<span class="font-italic">injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself</span>” (<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings </span>at [101]) (at [548] above). This meant that it was not enough for the Plaintiffs simply to show that harm would be a likely or probable or even inevitable consequence of Joe’s removal as a director.

</div> I have recounted in detail earlier (at [449]–[456]) how this sorry state of affairs came about because of the auditors’ queries about certain suspicious transactions which AIQ had entered into in the earlier period when Joe was a directors but the 4th to 7th Defendants had yet to join the company. It will be recalled too that some of these suspicious transactions involved substantial payments having been made by AIQ to entities in which Joe had an interest. I have also recounted earlier (at [449]–[456]) Joe’s repeated failure to provide satisfactory responses to the auditors’ queries and the 4th to 7th Defendants’ concern about the adverse effect which the audit issues had on AIQ’s efforts to raise funds. In relation to TCP, the difficulties which AIQ faced in raising funds due to the lack of “clean” books would obviously also impact TCP, which depended at least in part on loans from AIQ to fund its operations (as at [299]–[307] above). More generally, the concerns over the potentially improper past transactions and Joe’s role therein had led the 4th to 7th Defendants to view Joe with considerable circumspection. These circumstances showed that the 4th to 7th Defendants had grounds for harbouring reservations about the manner in which Joe had conducted himself as director – and in believing that it was in the companies’ best interests to exit him from the boards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">591 Finally, the evidence showed that the 4th to 7th Defendants had sought and acted upon the advice of the companies’ lawyers before proceeding with the AIQ EGM and the TCP AGM. For example, in the lead-up to the 28 May 2018 EGM, Kian Wai updated the other Directors on 3 May 2018

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The fact that the 4th to 7th Defendants had sought and acted upon lawyers’ advice suggested to me that they were concerned to ensure that they were acting lawfully. This formed yet another piece of evidence that militated against their having harboured any wrongful intent to injure or damage Joe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">592 In light of the above reasons, I rejected the Plaintiffs’ contention that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had acted with the intention to injure or harm Joe vis-à-vis his removal as a director of AIQ and TCP. For the same reasons, I also rejected their contention that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had acted with the “predominant purpose” of injuring Joe.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Procuring AIQ to falsely deny Joe’s claims for outstanding loans and salary in an effort to disable Joe from utilising some or part of the same to participate in the Rights Issue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">593 Next, the Plaintiffs claimed that in furtherance of an agreement between them, the 3rd to 7th Defendants procured AIQ to falsely deny Joe’s claims for outstanding loans and salary. As with their oppression claim, the Plaintiffs claimed that this was done by the 3rd to 7th Defendants in order to prevent Joe from using the monies to participate in the Rights Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">594 I have explained earlier why the 4th to 7th Defendants were justified in refusing Joe’s proposal to participate in the Rights Issue by converting his loans into shares (see [370]–[373] above). I have also explained earlier why I found that the 4th to 7th Defendants had valid reasons to resist Joe’s claims for payment of outstanding loans and salary at the points in time when he demanded payment – notwithstanding (<span class="font-italic">inter alia)</span> the existence of the Share Transfer Deed. In light of these earlier findings, even if it could be said that there had been a breach of AIQ’s loan agreement with Joe and/or the employment agreement and/or the Share Transfer Deed, this appeared to me to be a case in which the principle in <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt </span>[1920] 3 KB 497 (“<span class="font-italic">Said v Butt </span>principle”) should apply to confer 4th to 7th Defendants with immunity from personal liability. As the CA explained in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [53]–[65]), the <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt </span>principle provides that when a director acts <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>within the scope of his authority, he is ordinarily immune from tortious liability for procuring his company’s breach of contract. Thus, for example, where a company’s former managing director sued the other directors for unlawfully conspiring to induce the company to terminate his employment contract with the company, the <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt </span>principle would be capable of application if the directors could show that they had acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>within the scope of their office (<span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan</span><span class="font-italic"> Ivan v Levy Maurice and others </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 801 at [43]–[44]). In the present case, it followed from my earlier findings at [486]–[502] that the 4th to 7th Defendants were acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>within the scope of their office when they caused AIQ to resist paying off Joe’s salary and loan claims at the points in time when he demanded payment. Accordingly, by virtue of the <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt </span>principle, they should be entitled to immunity from liability in respect of the Plaintiffs’ claims in unlawful and lawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">595 Further and in the alternative, the Plaintiffs were unable to point to any objective evidence to show that there was a <span class="font-italic">combination </span>of the <span class="font-italic">3rd to the 7th</span> Defendants to cause AIQ to wrongfully deny Joe’s salary and loan claims. GSS consistently maintained that these were management matters for the 4th to 7th Defendants to handle; and although the Plaintiffs claimed that GSS was in truth the “shadow director” pulling the 4th to 7th Defendants’ strings, I have explained (at [283]–[289]) why I found this allegation about GSS’ role to be baseless. On the evidence adduced, in short, there was nothing to show that GSS took part in the 4th to 7th Defendants’ decisions to cause AIQ to resist payment of Joe’s salary and loan claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">596 Further and in any event, even assuming the Plaintiffs were able to prove a combination of the 3rd to the 7th Defendants, I was satisfied – in light of my findings that the 4th to 7th Defendants had genuine reasons to resist payment – that the Plaintiffs were unable to prove that the Defendants acted with an intention to cause injury to Joe; much less, that they acted for the predominant purpose of causing injury to Joe.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) Wrongfully diverting Joe’s shareholder loans to AIQ as well as other resources to TCP without Joe’s consent </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">597 Next, the Plaintiffs alleged that the 3rd to 7th Defendants conspired to divert AIQ’s funds and other resources to TCP. The Plaintiffs claimed that Joe did not realise that his shareholder loans to AIQ were being diverted to TCP along with other resources such as AIQ staff; and that he never gave his consent to this diversion of resources.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">598 I have found earlier that Joe was involved from the outset in the discussions about the setting-up of TCP; that he approved the proposal to set up TCP as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIQ; and that he understood that upon TCP’s incorporation, resources from AIQ would have to be channelled to TCP, as there was no other source of funding for TCP at that stage (see [299]–[307]). I have also found that there was ample documentary evidence to show that Joe was regularly updated about TCP’s funding needs and was well aware that the monies he lent AIQ were being used – at least in part – to fund TCP’s expenses. In the circumstances, it was entirely unmeritorious – indeed, disingenuous – of Joe to claim that AIQ funds and other resources were diverted to TCP without his knowledge and consent. The movement of funds and other resources from AIQ to TCP could not therefore form the basis for a claim by the Plaintiffs in conspiracy (whether by unlawful or lawful means).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) Procuring the publication of the SAR containing false allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties against Joe</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">599 Next, in respect of the Plaintiffs’ allegation about the commissioning of the “untrue” and “malicious” Special Audit Report, I have earlier set out in some detail my findings that the 4th to 7th Defendants had genuine reasons to commission a Special Audit Report and subsequently to issue a summary of the findings in this report to all AIQ shareholders (see at [448]–[457], [468]–[471]). I have also explained (at [458]–[467]) why I found that the Plaintiffs were unable to substantiate their allegations about the Special Audit Report being filled with malicious untruths. In light of my earlier findings, I was satisfied that the Plaintiffs could not prove any “unlawful” element in the commissioning of the Special Audit and/or in the issuance of a summary of the findings to AIQ shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">600 In this connection, I noted that the Plaintiffs sought to rely on two emails

</div> was sent only to Kian Wai. The remark “Let us not do things in half measure. Let’s go all the way to drive [Joe] out of AIQ and Singapore” was made by GSS in relation to his suggestion to Kian Wai that complaints against Joe should be lodged with ACRA and the Ministry of Manpower (“<span class="font-weight-bold">MOM</span>”) in view of Joe’s fear of “unwelcome government attention”. Despite GSS’ request that Kian Wai “share” his email with “the others” (presumably the other Directors), Kian Wai’s reply was simply that he had “noted” it and shared it with AIQ’s lawyers ("<span class="font-weight-bold">JLC</span>"). There was no evidence that Kian Wai – or any of the other Directors – agreed with and endorsed GSS’ remarks and suggestions. On the basis of such evidence, it was simply not possible to find that there was a “combination” of the 3rd to 7th Defendants and/or that the 3rd to 7th Defendants acted with the intention to cause injury to Joe. <span class="font-italic">A fortiori,</span> there was no evidence on which to find that they acted with the “predominant purpose” of causing injury to Joe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">602 In respect of the second email dated 27 May 2018, while it was true that GSS had alluded to his hope that the Special Audit would be “the first step that will take Joe to prison”, as I explained earlier (at [456]), this appeared to me to be an instance of GSS venting his spleen in private; and there was no evidence to show that the 4th to 7th Defendants endorsed his comment or that they worked together thereafter to cause injury to Joe. Indeed, it would appear that Joe was given multiple opportunities to resolve the audit issues with the auditors – and that the Special Audit was launched only after Joe’s repeated failure to provide satisfactory answers to the auditors (at [449]–[454] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(9) Whether the Plaintiffs’ claims about winding-up and the Assignment Agreement are properly based on personal wrongs</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Conspiring to have AIQ and TCP wound up in order to frustrate Joe’s recovery of his outstanding loans and salary, as well as the legal costs incurred by Joe in pursuing the same</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">603 Next, the Plaintiffs alleged that the 3rd to 7th Defendants unlawfully conspired to wind up AIQ and TCP in order to frustrate Joe’s efforts to recover his outstanding loans and salary. As a starting point, I have earlier found that there was no wrongdoing associated with the winding-up of both companies: on the evidence adduced, they were wound up on legitimate grounds: both companies were unable to pay their debts and could not raise further fresh funding (at [512]–[515] above). Accordingly, there was no element of unlawfulness to support a claim of unlawful means conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">604 I have also found (at [525]–[531]) that despite AIQ’s dire financial straits, the 4th to 7th Defendants had put in considerable work to keep the business going and to ask GSS for further funding; further, that their lack of success in developing and commercialising the VRT was in no way due to a lack of effort. I have highlighted too (at [532]) AIQ’s consistent loss-making record – even during the three-year period from 2014 to 2017, when Joe was a director and prior to the 4th to 7th Defendants joining the board. Having regard to these findings, I found that the Plaintiffs could not prove that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had combined and agreed to engineer the winding-up of AIQ and TCP, nor could the Plaintiffs prove that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had the intention (much less, “predominant purpose”) to cause injury to Joe by winding up the companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Assignment Agreement / Misappropriation of the Secured Patents in order to continue development on the same in Scanto without Joe’s involvement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">605 The Plaintiffs also alleged that the 3rd to 7th Defendants unlawfully conspired to misappropriate the Secured Patents from AIQ for GSS’ benefit, by causing AIQ to enter into the Assignment Agreement with GSS. I have earlier found that there was no wrongful conduct on the part of the 3rd to 7th Defendants in relation to the Assignment Agreement (see [534]–[543]). Given my findings, there was no element of unlawfulness to support a claim of unlawful means conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">606 The Plaintiffs also failed to satisfy me that the 3rd to 7th Defendants had the intention to cause injury to Joe by bringing about the Assignment Agreement; much less, that they acted with the predominant purpose of causing Joe injury or harm

</div>; and while GSS did in this email suggest to Kian Wai that complaints should be made to ACRA and MOM about Joe’s record as a director, it was clear that Kian Wai’s only response was to acknowledge that he would share GSS’ comments with AIQ’s lawyers: there was no evidence that Kian Wai – or the 4th to 7th Defendants as a whole – agreed with and endorsed GSS’ suggestion about using Joe’s fear of “unwelcome government attention” to “drive him out of AIQ and Singapore”. Nor was there any evidence that GSS’ suggestion that complaints be made to ACRA and MOM was ever taken up. More fundamentally, there was no discussion in this email of GSS’ purported desire and/or plans to make use of AIQ’s financial woes to obtain the Secured Patents on the cheap. As for the second email, this was the oft-cited email of 27 May 2018

</div> in which GSS, upon hearing of the impending launch of a Special Audit, expressed the hope that it would be the “first step” that would “take Joe to prison”. I have noted earlier that this remark appeared to be an instance of GSS venting his spleen in private. More importantly, again, there was no discussion in this email of GSS’ purported desire and/or plans to make use of AIQ’s financial woes to obtain the Secured Patents on the cheap. In the circumstances, I did not find that either email offered any support to the Plaintiffs’ claims of conspiracy vis-à-vis the Assignment Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">607 Finally, I rejected the Plaintiffs’ contention that the 4th to 7th Defendants had “simply rolled over without any resistance”, when GSS had brought his winding up application against AIQ, when GSS would have been required to account to AIQ for the balance of any proceeds from the Secured Patents.

</div> Having regard to the findings set out at [513]–[515], and having regard in particular to the fact that the Secured Patents had failed to generate any monetary value or returns in all the time since their registration, there was simply no basis for the Plaintiffs to insinuate that the Secured Patents could have been used to reduce or discharge the sums owing under GSS’ Convertible Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Deliberately engineering the winding up of AIQ and TCP so that GSS and the 4th to 7th Defendants would be able to continue developing and capitalizing on the VRT without Joe’s involvement and as a means to conceal their wrongdoings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">608 This allegation was in essence a combination of both the allegations at (A) and (B).
