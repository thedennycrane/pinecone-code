These are the detailed grounds of our decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On appeal, the parties only disputed a single issue, that is, whether there was a real risk of dissipation of assets by the appellant (see below at [22]). We therefore set out only the facts that are relevant to this issue. The complete facts are set out in the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The appellant, Milaha Explorer Pte Ltd (“Milaha”), is a Singapore-incorporated company. It is a special purpose vehicle incorporated for the purpose of owning its sole asset, a vessel called the “Milaha Explorer” (the “Vessel”). Milaha has a paid-up capital of $50,000 and is fully owned by a company called Milaha Offshore Holding Company Pte Ltd (“Milaha Offshore”), which is in turn fully owned by Milaha Offshore Support Services Co W.L.L. (“Milaha Support”). Milaha’s ultimate beneficial owner is Qatari Navigation QPSC (“Qatari Navigation”), which owns 99.5% of the shares in Milaha Support. Qatari Navigation is a public company listed on the Qatar stock exchange.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The respondent, Pengrui Leasing (Tianjin) Co Ltd (“Pengrui”), is a Chinese company engaged in the business of ship-owning and leasing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The memorandum of agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The dispute between the parties relates to the alleged breach of a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) signed by the parties on 31 May 2021. Under the MOA, Milaha agreed to sell the Vessel to Pengrui for US$26m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 We highlight two relevant clauses in the MOA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 13 (“the buyer’s default clause”), should the deposit not be paid in accordance with cl 2, Milaha had the right to cancel the MOA immediately and Pengrui would be liable to pay compensation to Milaha. Should the balance price not be paid in accordance with cl 3, Milaha would be entitled to cancel the MOA and forfeit the deposit together with any interest earned thereon.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under cl 16 (“the arbitration clause”), any dispute between the parties would be referred to arbitration in London.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 A dispute over the MOA arose shortly after it was signed. In late July 2021, Pengrui alleged that Milaha had breached the MOA because the Vessel did not meet certain requirements stipulated in the MOA. There was then a meeting on 2 August 2021 (the “2 August 2021 meeting”). Certain variations to the MOA were allegedly discussed at this meeting. In these proceedings, Pengrui denied that its representative attended the 2 August 2021 meeting. It therefore denied that there were any discussions between the parties regarding the variation of the MOA on 2 August 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Milaha, on the other hand, alleged that Pengrui was in breach of the MOA for failing to effect the amendments discussed and agreed to during the 2 August 2021 meeting. Milaha took the position that Pengrui had wrongly repudiated the contract by its failure. Milaha therefore sent Pengrui a letter on 12 August 2021 (the “12 August 2021 letter”) cancelling the MOA. Milaha also highlighted in the 12 August 2021 letter its contractual right under the buyer’s default clause to sell the Vessel to someone else upon Pengrui’s breach of contract. Pengrui replied on 16 August 2021 stating that Milaha’s exercise of the buyer’s default clause was wrongful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Pengrui then commenced arbitration proceedings in London (the “London arbitration”) pursuant to the arbitration clause. Thus, the factual disputes are to be resolved in the London arbitration. We emphasise that in setting out the factual background to this appeal, we are <span class="font-italic">not</span> making any conclusive findings of fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The procedural history leading to this appeal was somewhat involved. On 20 August 2021, Pengrui filed HC/OS 849/2021 (“OS 849”) <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>seeking a Mareva injunction against Milaha in aid of the London arbitration. The <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>Mareva Injunction in OS 849 was granted by the Judge on 23 August 2021. On 9 September 2021, Milaha filed HC/SUM 4226/2021 (“SUM 4226”) to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>Mareva Injunction. SUM 4226 was dismissed by the Judge on 18 October 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Milaha then appealed against the Judge’s decision. However, the appeal was initially filed to the Appellate Division of the High Court. Thereafter, Milaha filed CA/OS 31/2021 to transfer the appeal to this court. Pengrui objected to the transfer and filed AD/SUM 35/2021 (“SUM 35”) to strike out the Notice of Appeal. The transfer of the appeal to this court was allowed on 25 January 2022: see <span class="font-italic">Milaha Explorer Pte Ltd v Pengrui Leasing (Tianjin) Co Ltd</span> [2022] 1 SLR 1147. SUM 35 was dismissed on 15 February 2022.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The dispute below centred around whether the requirements for the grant of a Mareva injunction set out in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and another v</span><span class="font-italic"> Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR<span class="font-italic"> </span>558 (“<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>”) were satisfied. These requirements are as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether there is a valid cause of action over which the court has jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether Pengrui as the claimant has a good arguable case on the merits;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether Milaha has assets within the jurisdiction; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) whether there is a real risk that Milaha will dissipate its assets to frustrate the enforcement of an anticipated judgment of the court or tribunal.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In response to Pengrui’s argument that all the above requirements were satisfied, Milaha argued that Pengrui had failed to give full and frank disclosure of material facts and therefore, the Mareva injunction should be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge held that all the requirements in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>were satisfied. The Judge also held that Pengrui did not fail to give full and frank disclosure of material facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In support of its argument that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets, Pengrui pointed to the corporate structure of Milaha. Specifically, Pengrui highlighted that Milaha had a paid-up capital of only $50,000 and its sole shareholder is Milaha Offshore. It, however, recognised that Milaha’s ultimate owner is Qatari Navigation. Pengrui also pointed out that Milaha had suffered accumulated losses totalling over US$12m as of 31 December 2019. Milaha was only able to stay afloat due to financial support from Qatari Navigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In response, Milaha submitted that the mere fact that it was a special purpose vehicle and a one-ship company did not evince a real risk of dissipation. Further, Pengrui knew that Milaha’s ultimate owner is Qatari Navigation, which is a listed company in Qatar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Judge held that there was a real risk that Milaha would dissipate its assets for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If not for the continued financial support of Qatari Navigation, Milaha would be insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is cold comfort to a creditor to be told that a Qatari listed company is the ultimate shareholder of its debtor when the parent company is not shown to be a shareholder of the debtor as in this case. Hence, Milaha’s submission that “[Pengrui] is fully aware that [Milaha] is ultimately owned by Qatari Navigation, a Qatari public company traded on the Qatar Stock Exchange” is neither here nor there.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Should Pengrui succeed in the arbitral proceedings, Pengrui would still be at the mercy of Qatari Navigation as to whether it wishes to bail out Milaha and meet Milaha’s legal obligations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Nothing could be clearer as to Milaha’s intentions than the 12 August 2021 letter which stated that Milaha was free to sell the Vessel to other buyers. This demonstrated a real risk of dissipation of assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Bearing in mind that Milaha is a special purpose vehicle and a one-ship company, there was reason to fear that if Pengrui succeeded in the arbitral proceedings, the award would be rendered nugatory by the prior sale of the Vessel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Judge also dealt with Pengrui’s argument that there was dishonesty on Milaha’s part in concealing material facts relating to the Vessel. Pengrui submitted that such dishonesty further supported the conclusion that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets. The Judge disregarded Pengrui’s (hotly contested) allegations of dishonesty on the part of Milaha, citing [66] of <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>, which stated that the existence of a real risk of dissipation must be assessed <span class="font-italic">independently</span> from the prospect of the claimant’s eventual success (or failure) in establishing an allegation of dishonesty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Judge also noted that when Milaha’s counsel Mr Edgar Chin (“Mr Chin”) was asked whether Milaha would provide security if the court were to discharge the injunction, Mr Chin responded that he would take his client’s instructions and added that his client had no plans to sell the Vessel. If they did, they would pay the entire proceeds into court. The Judge noted that Milaha’s counsel did not revert on the inquiry nor on his statement on his client’s intention and “[h]ad Milaha offered security, the court would have discharged the Injunction Order without more”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In the event, the injunction granted prohibited Milaha from removing from Singapore or in any way dealing with or disposing of its assets in Singapore whether jointly or severally owned up to the value of US$23,760,473. The prohibition was specifically stated to include the Vessel, Milaha’s property and assets in Singapore and money in its Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited bank account numbered XXX178 (“the HSBC Account”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue in this appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As earlier alluded to, Milaha only contested the Judge’s decision that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets on Milaha’s part. This was therefore the sole issue on appeal. We turn next to detail our decision in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The essential test, as stated by this court in <span class="font-italic">JTrust Asia Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Group Lease Holdings Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 2 SLR 159 (“<span class="font-italic">JTrust</span>”) at [64], is whether there is objectively a real risk that a<span class="font-italic"> </span>judgment may not be satisfied because of a risk of unjustified dealings with assets. The claimant must produce “solid evidence” to demonstrate this risk, and not just bare assertions of fact: see also <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The court would consider, among others, the following factors in assessing whether there is a real risk of dissipation (see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [65]): (a) the nature of the assets which are to be the subject of the proposed injunction; (b) the ease with which the assets could be disposed of or dissipated; (c) the nature and financial standing of the defendant’s business; (d) the length of time the defendant has been in business; (e) the domicile or residence of the defendant; (f) if the defendant is a foreign entity, the country in which it is registered and the availability of reciprocal enforcement of local judgments or awards in that country; (g) the defendant’s past or existing credit record; (h) any intention expressed by the defendant about future dealings with the assets; (i) connections between a defendant and other companies which have defaulted on awards or judgments; (j) the defendant’s behaviour in respect of the claims, including that in response to the claimant’s claims; and (k) good grounds for alleging that the defendant has been dishonest. It can be seen from many of these factors that the court is also concerned to determine whether there are circumstances suggesting that the defendant not only can but likely will frustrate the judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Milaha’s corporate structure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 We begin by addressing the arguments in respect of Milaha’s corporate structure. At the outset, we observe that the mere fact that a defendant holds their assets through offshore structures or by way of special purpose vehicles is not in itself evidence of a risk of dissipation: see <span class="font-italic">Holyoake and another v Candy and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2018] Ch 297 at [27]. Ultimately, we must look at all the surrounding circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In our view, Milaha’s corporate structure did not support a real risk of dissipation of assets. Its structure can be explained by the purpose of its incorporation. It is a special purpose vehicle incorporated for the purpose of owning the Vessel. Milaha explained that it is industry practice (and regarded as common commercial sense) to ringfence risks and liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels for the vessels to be put in the ownership of one-ship companies. Due weight must also be accorded to the fact that Milaha is owned by a public listed company being traded on the Qatar stock exchange.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 More importantly, Milaha’s corporate structure must have been known to Pengrui when the MOA was concluded. At the least, information on Milaha’s corporate structure was available to Pengrui and Pengrui could have conducted basic searches to obtain that information. There was no suggestion by Pengrui that Milaha had made any attempt to conceal Milaha’s corporate structure. We contrast this with <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span>, where the corporate structures of the relevant companies there were described as “complex and opaque” and there were attempts made to conceal the ownership of the relevant companies: see <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span> at [73]–[74]. In the present case, Pengrui conducted business with Milaha with its eyes wide open and it must therefore be taken to have accepted the risks associated with Milaha’s corporate structure. That Pengrui would be, as the Judge had described, “at the mercy of Qatari Navigation as to whether it wishes to bail out Milaha and meet Milaha’s legal obligations” was simply part of the risks associated with dealing with Milaha, which Pengrui had accepted. If Pengrui had been perturbed by such risks, it could have looked for ways to mitigate the same. One such way would perhaps have been to ask Milaha’s ultimate owner to provide a corporate guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Having accepted the risks involved, Pengrui alleged in court that Milaha might siphon monies from any subsequent sale of the Vessel to pay other creditors or its ultimate beneficial owner, Qatari Navigation. But even if monies were to be paid out, such payment could well be for legitimate commercial purposes like paying off its creditors. The key inquiry is still whether there were unjustified dealings with assets, which we discuss in detail below at [31]–[35]. If Milaha eventually becomes insolvent because of these payments, Pengrui’s remedy would lie in insolvency law. Perhaps Pengrui could seek to set aside such payments based on fraud or undue preference if it is so advised. But it cannot seek a Mareva injunction on the basis that the business risks (which it was or should have been aware of) may materialise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The purpose of a Mareva injunction, we stress, is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to provide security to a litigant or to guard against potential insolvency of the counterparty: see <span class="font-italic">Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> Shieh-Peen Clement and another v Ho Chin Nguang and others</span> [2010] 4 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement</span>”) at [26]; see also <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Dalzavod Joint Stock Co</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 813 at [14]. Instead, the undoubted object of the Mareva injunction is to prevent the course of justice from being frustrated by a defendant’s deliberate actions which would have the effect of defeating wholly or in part any judgment or order which the claimant may thereafter obtain against the defendant: see <span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement </span>at [26] citing <span class="font-italic">Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc</span> [2007] 1 AC 181. The test, as earlier explained, is still whether there were unjustified dealings with assets or a real risk thereof on Milaha’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Before turning to address the arguments in respect of whether Milaha had engaged in unjustified dealings with its assets, we first make some observations on how we should treat foreign companies and/or companies with foreign ultimate beneficial owners when deciding whether there was a real risk of dissipation of assets. In a previous decision of this court, we observed that the fact that the relevant parties are not based in Singapore may support the existence of a real risk of dissipation: see <span class="font-italic">JTrust </span>at [65] and [80]–[82]. But at the same time, we are also fully cognisant of the reality that commercial parties conducting business, especially in a global business hub like Singapore, often have foreign origins. We therefore make the point that the foreign origin of a company/person is but <span class="font-italic">one</span> factor to consider and <span class="font-italic">cannot in and of itself</span> justify a real risk of dissipation of assets. Ultimately, the inquiry is a holistic one that accounts for all the surrounding circumstances and factors stated above at [24].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there were unjustified dealings with assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Judge noted (at [84] of the Judgment) that “nothing could be clearer as to Milaha’s intentions” to dissipate its assets than the 12 August 2021 letter where Milaha iterated its right to sell the Vessel under the buyer’s default clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 We stress that dealing with assets in and of itself would be insufficient to show a real risk of dissipation; the dealing with assets must be <span class="font-italic">unjustified</span>. In other words, if the dealing with assets was for legitimate commercial reasons, then such dealing would not be unjustified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In our judgment, there was no unjustified dealing with assets by Milaha. We make three points. First, Milaha was simply stating the consequence of Pengrui’s alleged breach of contract in the 12 August 2021 letter. There was nothing unusual about this as contractual parties often bring certain clauses to the attention of the counterparty when a dispute arises. Secondly, at the date of the application for the Mareva Injunction (and even at the date of the hearing of the appeal), the Vessel had not been sold and Milaha had not entered into any contract for the sale of the Vessel. Finally, even if the Vessel were eventually sold, there could be various legitimate commercial reasons for the sale. For instance, Milaha could be planning to replace the Vessel with a newer or bigger ship, or its financial situation might be so bad that it needed to realise its assets and had come up with a scheme to settle its indebtedness. Ultimately, Pengrui bore the burden of producing “solid evidence” of a real risk of dissipation. In our view, no such evidence was produced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The present case can also be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa</span>”), the facts of which, at first glance, appeared similar to those of the present case.<span class="font-italic"> </span>There, the court noted that there was no explanation offered by the respondent for the sale of its only vessel and its cessation of business. This lack of explanation supported the conclusion that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets: see <span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa </span>at [19] and [23]–[26]. Here, Milaha did not cease its business but there were allegations that Milaha had attempted to sell its only asset, the Vessel. There are, however, two important points to bear in mind here that were absent in <span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa</span>. First, Milaha had from the outset been desirous of selling the Vessel and that was the reason the MOA was concluded. It would or should have been in Pengrui’s reasonable contemplation that, in these circumstances, if its deal with Milaha fell through, Milaha would look to sell the Vessel to someone else. The sale of the Vessel to another commercial party would simply be a continuation of what Milaha had set out to do in the first place. This was not what happened in <span class="font-italic">Guan Chong Cocoa</span> where the sale of the vessel was only undertaken after a completely unrelated dispute had arisen and a claim had been made. Secondly, a right of re-sale was expressly provided for in cl 13 of the MOA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the buyer’s default clause. In these circumstances, it cannot be inferred that Milaha’s potential sale of the Vessel would simply be to avoid the consequences of a lawsuit rather than for legitimate commercial reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  We also make some observations on Milaha’s conduct in relation to the deposit paid to it by Pengrui. Under the MOA, Pengrui was obligated to pay Milaha a deposit of US$5.2m, which it did on 27 June 2021. The deposit was paid into Milaha’s HSBC Account. Subsequently, on 23 August 2021 Pengrui obtained the Mareva injunction against Milaha’s assets, which included the HSBC Account. As of 1 November 2021, the balance in the HSBC Account was US$5.186m; only about US$13,000 (only about 0.25% of the deposit) had been spent by Milaha. It could have dissipated the deposit in the two-month period between the payment of the deposit and the granting of the Mareva injunction, but it did not. This, in our view, supported our conclusion above that there was no real risk of dissipation of assets by Milaha.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pengrui’s allegations of dishonesty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 We agreed with the Judge that Pengrui’s allegations of dishonesty on Milaha’s part should be disregarded. As stated by this court in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier </span>at [93]–[94], the alleged dishonesty must be of such a nature that it has a real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation. In our view, there was no such connection here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Further, the allegations of dishonesty are hotly contested. On a quick perusal of the facts, we note that the arguments by both sides on the substance of the dispute were finely balanced. For instance, although Pengrui alleged that Milaha had lied about the condition of the Vessel, there was evidence showing that Pengrui continued to negotiate with Milaha to reduce the price of the Vessel upon discovery of certain issues with the Vessel. This indicated that Milaha had no intention of defrauding Pengrui and was willing to engage them on the reduction of the price of the Vessel. Again, we stress that we are not making any conclusive findings of fact as it would be impossible without a full hearing to conclude that Milaha had acted dishonestly. Again, we stress that the proper forum to resolve these factual disputes would be the London arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We also make two other observations. First, we emphasise the draconian effects of the Mareva injunction. As Milaha had only a single asset, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Vessel, the Mareva injunction essentially prevented Milaha from conducting its entire business in its best interests. In deciding whether to grant a Mareva injunction, the court should balance the effects of the Mareva injunction on the respondent against the potential prejudice or loss that would be caused to the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Secondly, Pengrui in its Respondent’s Case suggested that Milaha should set aside a sum of money as security or pay that sum of money into escrow or into court. As earlier explained (at [29]), it is not the purpose of a Mareva injunction to provide security. Further, as there was no basis for a Mareva injunction, there would similarly be no basis on which to compel Milaha to do the things suggested by Pengrui.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For the above reasons, we allowed the appeal and set aside the Mareva injunction. We awarded Milaha costs fixed at $45,000 (inclusive of disbursements) for its costs here and below. We also set aside the costs order made by the Judge. Pengrui was ordered to refund the costs below paid by Milaha. The usual consequential orders applied.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Judith Prakash<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Harpreet Singh Nehal SC, Jordan Tan, <br/>Victor Leong (Audent Chambers LLC) (instructed), <br/>Edgar Chin Ren Howe, Ch’ng Cheng Yi Samantha, and <br/>Teo Jim Yang (Ascendant Legal LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Goh Kok Leong (Ang &amp; Partners) for the respondent; <br/>Shawn Lim Zi Xuan (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for OHT Osprey AS (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

Milaha’s ultimate beneficial owner is Qatari Navigation QPSC (“Qatari Navigation”), a public company listed on the Qatar stock exchange.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 On 31 May 2021, Milaha and Pengrui Leasing (Tianjin) Co Ltd (“Pengrui”), the respondent, entered into a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) for the sale of the Vessel from Milaha to Pengrui. Shortly thereafter, a dispute over the MOA arose. Milaha alleged that Pengrui was in repudiatory breach of the MOA, and gave notice to Pengrui in a letter dated 12 August 2021 (the “12 August 2021 Letter”) that it was cancelling the MOA and exercising its contractual right under clause 13 of the MOA (the “buyer’s default clause”) to sell the Vessel. Pengrui disputed Milaha’s invocation of the buyer’s default clause and commenced arbitration proceedings in London pursuant to the arbitration clause in the MOA.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 On 20 August 2021, Pengrui filed an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application seeking a Mareva injunction against Milaha in aid of the London arbitration. The injunction was granted by the judge of the General Division of the High Court’s (the “Judge”), who dismissed Milaha’s subsequent application to set aside the injunction. The injunction prohibited Milaha from dealing with its assets, including the Vessel, up to a value of US$23,760,473. The Judge found that there was a real risk that Milaha would dissipate its assets given its express intention to sell the Vessel to other buyers as stated in the 12 August 2021 Letter. The Judge, however, found that Pengrui’s allegations of dishonesty on Milaha’s part in concealing material facts relating to the Vessel should be disregarded. Dissatisfied with the decision, Milaha appealed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the Court </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The sole question before the court was whether the Judge was correct in finding that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets on Milaha’s part. This, in turn, required a real risk, objectively assessed, that a judgment may not be satisfied because of a risk of unjustified dealings with assets by the defendant. In this connection, dealing with assets in and of itself would be insufficient to show a real risk of dissipation; the dealing with the assets must be unjustified. Further, the foreign origin or foreign connection of a company/person is a relevant factor, but cannot conclusively lead to a finding of a real risk of dissipation of assets. Ultimately, the inquiry turns on whether there are circumstances suggesting that the defendant not only can but likely will frustrate the judgment, thereby defeating in whole or in part any judgment or order which the claimant may thereafter obtain against the defendant: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">22]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">24], [29]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">30]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> [32]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The court found that Milaha’s corporate structure did not, in itself, support the finding of a real risk of dissipation of assets. The mere fact that a defendant holds its assets through offshore structures or by way of special purpose vehicles is not in itself evidence of a risk of dissipation. Milaha’s corporate structure can be explained by the purpose of its incorporation, which was to ringfence risks and liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels. This corporate structure must have been known to Pengrui when the MOA was concluded; Pengrui must therefore be taken to have accepted the associated risks. That monies from any subsequent sale of the Vessel may be used to pay Milaha’s other creditors or Qatari Navigation does not mean that there was impropriety; such payments could be for legitimate commercial purposes: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">25]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">28]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The court also found that there was no unjustified dealing with assets by Milaha. In the 12 August 2021 Letter, Milaha was merely stating the consequence of Pengrui’s alleged breach of contract. Further, as recently as the date of the hearing of the appeal, the Vessel had not been sold and Milaha had not entered into any contract for the sale of the Vessel. Even if the Vessel was eventually sold, there could be various legitimate commercial reasons for the sale. In this connection, the court observed that the sale of the Vessel to another commercial party would simply be a continuation of what Milaha had set out to do in the first place, and was in fact a contractual right that Milaha was entitled to exercise under the buyer’s default clause. Ultimately, the court found that Pengrui did not discharge its burden of showing “solid evidence” of a real risk of dissipation: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">33]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The court agreed with the Judge that Pengrui’s allegations of dishonesty on Milaha’s part should be disregarded. There was no real and material bearing between the alleged dishonesty and the risk of dissipation. In any case, such allegations were hotly contested and did not assist Pengrui in advancing its arguments: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>–<span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 In deciding whether to grant a Mareva injunction, the court should balance the effects of the Mareva injunction on the defendant against the potential prejudice or loss that would be caused to the applicant. To grant Pengrui the Mareva injunction against Milaha would be to prevent Milaha from conducting its business in its best interests: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The purpose of a Mareva injunction is not to provide security to a litigant or to guard against potential insolvency of the counterparty. There was therefore no basis on which to accept Pengrui’s suggestion that Milaha should set aside a sum of money as security or pay that sum into escrow or into court: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[2</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> [3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
