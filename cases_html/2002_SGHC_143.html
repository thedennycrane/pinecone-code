<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Prosecution’s case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The prosecution presented

the following facts: On 10 July 2001, Wong Fok Seng (‘Wong’), a security guard

at the Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 branch of Shop and Save (‘SNS’) was on duty. Wong

testified that at about 3:35 p.m., he saw Selve entering the store. She walked straight to

the fish section, bypassing some weighing machines at point "184" on exhibit

"P5" (the map of the store). Selve selected some "Selar" fish and put

them in a clear plastic bag provided by the store. After that, he saw Selve going to the

rice section, which he described as a "very quiet area". There, Selve put the

plastic bag containing the fish into an NTUC plastic bag that she had with her. She then

walked straight to the main entrance and made her exit quickly, without paying for the

fish. She had left the store and was already near the escalators outside the store when

Wong stopped her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        Wong saw that the NTUC

plastic bag that Selve was carrying contained the bag of fish that had not been paid for.

He asked her why she did not pay for the fish. She became very angry and spoke to him in

English in a loud voice. However, he did not understand her because he did not have a good

command of English. At this point, an Indian cashier, Ms. Isvari d/o P. Thirupathy

(‘Isvari’) came over because of the commotion. Wong pointed to the fish that

were still in the NTUC plastic bag and told Isvari that Selve did not pay for them. Isvari

spoke with Selve and asked her to follow Wong into the office of the manager, Ms

Shashikala d/o Packirisamy (‘Shashikala’).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Shashikala testified that,

when she questioned Selve about the theft, Selve kept denying that she had stolen the fish

but had only taken them outside the store to weigh them. She repeatedly claimed that she

was told by an executive in charge of the fish counter that the weighing machines were

outside. When asked why she had put the fish in the NTUC plastic bag if she wanted to

weigh them, Selve did not answer the question but continued saying that she just wanted to

weigh the fish. The police were called. Two male officers and one female officer came.

They asked who caught Selve and Shashikala told them that it was Wong.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        One of the police officers

was Staff Sergeant Tay Hwee Meng (‘SSGT Tay’). He testified that, on 10 July

2001, he was on Fast Response Car duty with his partner, Corporal Lai Yew Wai (‘CPL

Lai’). At about 3:59 p.m., he received a message asking him to proceed to SNS. After

he arrived there, he obtained the facts from Wong and proceeded to talk to Selve while Lai

took Wong’s statement. He also called for a female police officer to come to the

scene as Selve was a woman. Inspector Noorwati (‘INSP Noorwati’), SSGT

Tay’s team leader, came in response to his request. SSGT Tay testified that Selve was

very uncooperative when he questioned her and she refused to give her particulars to him.

She claimed that there was a misunderstanding but she did not tell him that she was

looking for a weighing machine. Tay took three photographs at the scene to use as

evidence. He left the clarification on whether an offence had actually been committed to

the Investigating Officer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The Investigating Officer

was one Sergeant Adrian Goh (‘SGT Goh’). On 11 July 2001, he interviewed Selve

to obtain her version of the facts. He also went down to SNS three times. During his first

visit, he ascertained the layout of the supermarket. On his second visit, he checked the

visibility of the weighing machines from the fish counter and on his last visit he took

Shashikala’s statement. He also called Wong to obtain his version of the facts. SGT

Goh also reviewed the statements of the arresting officers, SSGT Tay and CPL Lai. After

carrying out these investigations, he decided to charge Selve on the strength of

Wong’s statement which he had personally verified. He testified later that he had no

reason to suspect that that SSGT Tay, CPL Lai or Wong were lying in their statements

setting out the circumstances surrounding Selve’s arrest.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        As for the location of the

weighing machines, Shashikala and Wong testified that there were two weighing machines in

the store. In the morning, one machine would be placed near the fish counter. The other

machine would be placed near the vegetables and fruits. In the afternoon, however, both

machines would be placed at the same spot near the vegetables and fruits. This was where

the weighing machine was located at the time Selve was detained. Shashikala also testified

that this arrangement of shifting the weighing machines daily had been the store’s

practice for the past year.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        Lastly, Wong testified that

he had never seen Selve before 10 July 2001. He also testified that the store did not

promise or give him any incentives to catch shoplifters.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Defence’s case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Selve testified to the

following: She was a part-time office attendant and part-time helper at a canteen stall

run by her friend, Mohamad Shaheed (‘Shaheed’). She was a divorcee and had

custody of her three children. However, she claimed that she was not in any financial

difficulty.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        On 10 July 2001, she went

to the "NTUC" supermarket at Ang Mo Kio to purchase some groceries. She had $126

and some coins on her that day. She paid for her purchases and left carrying four

"NTUC" plastic bags containing the groceries. After that, she proceeded to SNS

to buy some "Selar" fish for the canteen at which she helped.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        At SNS, Selve walked

straight to the fish counter. She passed the two weighing machines there. She claimed

however, that she did not notice them. She explained that there were a lot of baskets

filled with fruits in that area. She intended to use the machine near the fish counter.

She had been to SNS twice before 10 July 2001, to buy fish and crabs. On both occasions,

she was there in the afternoon and she weighed her items at the machine near the fish

counter.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        When she was at the fish

counter, she met a Chinese man who was the executive in charge of that counter. She

identified Koh Chin Hoe (‘Koh’) as that executive. Koh helped her select some

"Selar" fish and put them inside a clear plastic bag. She then took the fish to

the machine near the fish counter to weigh them, but the weighing machine was not there.

Thus, she asked Koh where it was and whether he could help her weigh the fish. She claimed

that he refused to help her to weigh the fish because he was too busy. Instead, he pointed

around and said that the weighing machine was somewhere near the exit but he did not tell

her exactly where the machine was.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        She went towards the

direction of the exit to look for the machine. When she could not find it, she asked a

Chinese cashier for directions, only to be rudely told to find it herself. She then went

to the exit and stood on a red carpet there. At this point, she was approached by Wong who

accused her of not paying for the fish. She explained to him that she was trying to look

for the weighing machine. She also told an Indian cashier what happened but the cashier

did not help and told her to go into the manager’s office instead. Wong brought her

to the office. Subsequently, Shashikala and then the policemen came. She explained to

Wong, Shashikala, the male police officer interviewing her and another female police

officer that she did not steal the fish. She also asked them to call Koh to clarify the

matter but no one paid any attention to her pleas. She wanted to call her friend, Shaheed,

and the police allowed her to do so. After that, the police officers brought her back to

the police station where she was detained.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        Shaheed gave evidence for

the defence. He testified that, on the day in question, he received a telephone call from

Selve. She told him that she was being accused of shoplifting. He went down to the store.

At the store, he took 23 photographs of the store, under Selve’s directions to

"prove what the Accused was trying to say, that she was looking for a weighing

machine around the exit where she was directed by the fishmonger." However, he

admitted that he did not try to look for the weighing machine himself or pay any attention

to the signs which the store put up to indicate the position of the weighing machine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        Koh was the third witness

for the defence. His evidence was that on 10 July 2001, he saw Selve at the fish counter.

She picked some fish and put them in a clear plastic bag. She also asked him where she

could weigh the fish. He told her that she could do so "in front" and pointed to

the weighing machine near the vegetable and fruit counter. He testified that from where he

stood the sign board that was hanging above the weighing machine which indicated their

position and the machine could be seen clearly. It was only about six metres away from

where he was standing. After pointing out the location of the machine to her, he continued

with his work. He could not recall where she walked to.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        CPL Lai and INSP Noorwati

gave evidence as arresting officers. CPL Lai testified that he recorded Wong’s

statement but he did not speak to Selve at all. His evidence was that he saw the fish in

the NTUC plastic bag belonging to Selve. Wong told him that Selve did not pay for the fish

and Wong stopped her near the escalators outside the store. As for INSP Noorwati, she

testified that she was called to SNS on 10 July 2001. When she arrived, she spoke to her

officers in the manager’s office. She arrested Selve after ascertaining the situation

from her officers. INSP Noorwati remembered that Selve wanted to call someone but Selve

did not explain anything to her about the fish. INSP Noorwati said that her role was to

escort Selve, not to carry out investigations, which was the duty of the Investigating

Officer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        The last witness for the

Defence was Isvari, the Indian cashier that Selve spoke to, prior to being brought into

the manager’s office. Isvari testified that on 10 July 2001 she saw Wong speaking to

Selve and went over to help to translate. Wong told her that Selve stole some fish from

the store and put them in the NTUC plastic bag. Isvari gave evidence that Selve showed her

the NTUC plastic bag and she saw that there was a bag of fish in it. Selve explained that

she wanted to weigh the fish, but Isvari told her that if she really intended to do so,

she should not place the fish in the NTUC plastic bag. After that, Isvari told Selve to

follow Wong into the manager’s office.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        The trial judge concluded

that Selve was guilty of the offence of committing theft in a building used for the

custody of property. She accepted Wong’s evidence that Selve selected the fish and

put them into an NTUC plastic bag in a quiet corner. The fact that the fish was in the

NTUC bag that Selve was carrying was also corroborated by CPL Lai and Isvari.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        The judge disbelieved

Selve’s evidence that she was looking for a weighing machine to weigh the fish when

she was caught. She gave these reasons: <i>first</i>, Koh denied pointing to the exit when

Selve asked him where the weighing machine was. The judge accepted Koh’s testimony

that he pointed Selve to the machines near the vegetables and fruits. The weighing

machines and sign indicating their location were visible from the fish counter. <i>Secondly</i>,

the route she took to the fish counters showed that she had passed the two machines. <i>Thirdly</i>,

the judge found that Selve was familiar with the layout of the store as she admitted that

she had been to the store twice previously. As such, she ought to know that there were no

weighing machines outside the store. <i>Lastly</i>, the judge preferred Wong’s

testimony that Selve did not stop to ask a cashier for directions as to where the weighing

machines were placed but headed straight to the exit over Selve’s evidence that she

asked for stop to ask for directions. The judge observed that Selve had not called this

cashier to testify at trial. Furthermore, when asked to mark the route she took out of the

store, she omitted to mark the stop at the cashier. It was only when her counsel pointed

out this omission to her during her re-examination that she changed the drawing of the

route she took.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        The trial judge also gave

a detailed analysis of the credibility of the witnesses. She found Wong to be a reliable

witness because he did not have any incentive to frame Selve. Wong was never offered any

reward for catching shoplifters. In addition, the judge found that all the

prosecution’s witnesses withstood cross-examination. Their evidence corroborated with

each other and with even the defence’s witnesses. She observed that they had no

reason to conspire against Selve. On the other hand, she found that Selve was evasive and

gave contradictory evidence. She had reason to lie to get herself out of the charge. She

also discounted the evidence of Shaheed because it was hearsay and he had admitted that he

would "definitely" help Selve if she were in trouble.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        The only issue before me

was a factual one, whether Selve intended to leave SNS without paying for the

"Selar" fish in her possession, thereby committing theft in a building used for

the custody of property. As this was an appeal against the findings of fact made by the

trial judge, I applied the established principle that an appellate court will not disturb

findings of fact unless they are <i>clearly</i> reached against the weight of the evidence

: <i>Lim Ah Poh v PP </i><nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 713</nobr>, <i>Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP </i><nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 656</nobr>).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        After a review of the

evidence available, I was convinced that the trial judge had ample reasons to support her

finding that Selve had not intended to look for a weighing machine outside the store but

had wanted to leave the store without paying for the fish. In particular, I noted the

following pieces of evidence which pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that Selve was

guilty of the charge against her:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        First, Selve put the fish

which she had not paid for into an NTUC plastic bag and took that bag outside the store.

Selve never denied these facts. Her own witnesses, CPL Lai and Isvari, both clearly

testified that they saw the unpaid fish in Selve’s NTUC plastic bag. The evidence of

CPL Lai and Isvari was consistent with Wong’s testimony that he saw Selve go to a

"very quiet area" of the store, the rice section, and surreptitiously put the

fish into the NTUC plastic bag. I find no reason to doubt Wong’s evidence. The fact

that Selve put the unpaid fish into a white NTUC plastic bag and walked out of the store

made her story that she wanted to go outside to weigh the fish highly unbelievable. If it

was really her intention to weigh the fish and pay for them, she would not have placed

them in her own bag and bring that bag out of the store without paying. I also observed

that Selve never explained this inconsistency although she was confronted with it by

Isvari and Shashikala.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        Secondly, Selve had no

reason to believe that the weighing machines were outside of the store. She claimed that

she thought the machines were outside because Koh had told her that they were somewhere

near the exit. However, Koh, who was her own witness, testified that he had never told her

that the machines were near the exit. On the contrary, Koh gave evidence that he pointed

Selve towards the weighing machines near the vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, he also

testified that the machines were clearly visible from where he and Selve stood and were,

in fact, only a mere six metres away.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        In addition, Selve should

know that there were no weighing machines outside the store because she was familiar with

its layout. During her examination-in-chief, she said that she had been to the store

"many times" and that she sometimes went there as frequently as once every two

weeks. However, on further questioning by her own counsel, she subsequently said that she

had only been there twice before 10 July 2001. I doubted that she was being truthful about

the number of times she had been to the store before. Nevertheless, it was reasonable to

draw the conclusion that she was familiar with the store’s layout. She had been there

at least twice and she knew where the fish counter and the weighing machine next to the

fish counter was. The trial judge’s finding that it was incredible that Selve would

believe that the weighing machines were outside of the store in light of her familiarity

with the store’s layout, could not be faulted.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        Before me, Counsel for

Selve argued that the trial judge’s assessment of the witnesses was wrong because she

relied on Wong’s testimony. Wong gave evidence that he saw Selve put the fish into a

plastic bag at the fish counter without any help. Counsel for Selve pointed out that it

was impossible for Selve to place the fish into the plastic bag without help because she

only had the use of one of her hands as she was carrying the rest of her shopping bags

with her other hand. As such, Counsel for Selve submitted that Wong’s entire

testimony should be discredited.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        I rejected the argument

put forth by Counsel for Selve, which appeared to me to be an attempt to grasp for straws.

The question of exactly how Selve put the fish into the plastic bag was merely a minor

point which was unnecessary to prove the charge against her. In any case, in light of the

overwhelming evidence against Selve, such a minor discrepancy certainly could not show

that the trial judge was clearly wrong in accepting Wong’s testimony over

Selve’s.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        Furthermore, I agreed with

the trial judge’s analysis on the credibility of the witnesses. She observed rightly

that Wong and the police officers had no reason to conspire together to frame Selve. In

fact, their evidence was generally consistent with each other and even Selve’s own

witnesses, such as Koh and Isvari. On the other hand, Selve had every incentive to lie to

get herself acquitted. Her testimony contained many contradictions. Such contradictions

included whether or not she stopped to ask a cashier for directions to the weighing

machine, the number of times she had been to SNS previously and whether she was

financially strapped. Her evidence was also not corroborated by her own witnesses. The

trial judge’s finding that Shaheed’s evidence was hearsay and potentially biased

because of his close relationship with her was also not obviously wrong. I concluded that

Selve failed to show why the trial judge’s analysis was clearly wrong when she

preferred the testimony of the prosecution witnesses over Selve’s own and

Shaheed’s evidence.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        For the reasons given

above, I found that Selve did intend to take the fish out of the store without paying for

them, thereby committing the offence of committing theft in a building used for the

custody of property. Accordingly, I dismissed her appeal and confirmed her sentence.</p>
