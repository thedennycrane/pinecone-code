The decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) can be found in <span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck v Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP </span>[2020] SGHC 86 (“the GD”) and was made following a similar dismissal of the Application by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) in HC/OSB 129/2019 (“OSB 129”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Application was brought firstly on the basis that the SD was not validly served.

The appellant then contends that the SD should be set aside because the quantum of the debt is disputed; that he has a cross-demand that exceeds the debt under the SD; and that there was an implied term which disentitles the respondent from payment in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 26 October 2017 invoice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 A chronology of the relevant events can be found in Annex A.

</div> At that time, the appellant had not yet pursued taxation of either invoice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 15 January 2019, the appellant filed HC/OS 67/2019 (“OS 67/19”) seeking an order for taxation in respect of the 13 March 2018 invoice, as well as leave to seek an order for taxation in respect of the 26 October 2017 invoice given that the application was not made within the 12-month period prescribed by s 122 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). We note that for the 26 October 2017 invoice, the appellant did not require leave for an order for taxation so long as he satisfied the requirement of special circumstances under s 122 of the LPA. In the supporting affidavit filed for OS 67/19, the appellant stated that he had informed the respondent that there was no reason for it to have issued a statutory demand since the invoices were disputed and he was willing to have them taxed.

No appeal was filed by the appellant against Abdullah J’s decision. Cairnhill Law LLC (“Cairnhill Law”), his current solicitors, were appointed in relation to the taxation proceedings on 20 August 2019 (see GD at [7]). The bill of costs for the 13 March 2018 invoice has since been taxed by an AR. According to the respondent, aside from Section 2 costs, 12.38% of the bill of costs relating to the 13 March 2018 invoice was taxed off.

LVM Law Chambers LLC went on record as the appellant’s solicitors in the appeal on 6 June 2019. The respondent had previously communicated with the appellant at the email address used.

In contrast, the appellant had been the owner of the Bayshore Road property in March 2019, although a title search then had shown that the third party had already lodged a caveat as a purchaser.

The respondent also emphasised that a copy of the Advertisement had been immediately sent to Cairnhill Law on the same day and noted that the Advertisement was again referred to in the email to Cairnhill Law sent on 22 October 2019, which also attached a copy of the entire SD.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Before the Judge, the appellant contended that the SD should be set aside for the reasons mentioned in [2] above (except that the argument on the implied term was only raised on appeal). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was valid service</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Judge held that the Advertisement and the 4 October 2019 email, whether individually or collectively, constituted valid service (GD at [24] and [52]). The Judge was of the view that r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR was inapplicable in the present case since the respondent had the appellant’s last known address, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Bayshore Road property. However, this did not prevent the respondent from effecting valid service on the appellant by way of the Advertisement and/or the 4 October email under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the BR (GD at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Judge was of the view that the underlying purpose of the service regime under the BR is to provide the practical means for a creditor to effectually bring a statutory demand to a debtor’s attention and that the limbs of r 96(4) of the BR are not mutually exclusive. Where a creditor is unable to meet the requirements under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR, the statutory regime enables it to effect substituted service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the<span class="font-italic"> </span>BR. This is consistent with the plain wording of r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the BR which does not require that the modes of service under the other limbs be unavailable to the creditor and which allows for service by such other mode as the court would order, <span class="font-italic">including </span>a mode of substituted service by advertisement which does not fall within r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR (GD at [24]–[26], [28] and [37]). While the Judge agreed with the holding in <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong</span><span class="font-italic"> v ABN-AMRO Bank NV </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 31 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong</span>”) that the statutory demand itself, and not a notice thereof, must be advertised under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR, it did not follow that service by way of advertisement is exclusively governed by that provision, and no authority was cited by the appellant in support of such exclusivity (GD at [29] and [30]). Similarly, under O 62 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), the court may order that substituted service be effected by advertising a <span class="font-italic">notice</span> that an action has been commenced against the defendant, and the same ought to apply to r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the BR (GD at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In the Judge’s view, the ultimate question was whether the court was satisfied that the mode of substituted service employed by a creditor was <span class="font-italic">sufficient on the facts before it</span> and whether it amounted to a <span class="font-italic">reasonable step</span> to bring notice of the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention effectively. In the present case, the respondent had taken all reasonable steps to bring the SD to the appellant’s attention and utilised a mode of substituted service the court would have ordered in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Advertisement constituted valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) BR (GD at [31]–[34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Judge further accepted that the 4 October 2019 email to Cairnhill Law constituted valid service whether on its own or taken together with the Advertisement. Sending a notice of the SD by email to the appellant’s solicitors was effectual in bringing the SD to his notice as the solicitors had been acting for the appellant in the ongoing taxation proceedings for the 13 March 2018 invoice. It was entirely reasonable for the respondent to presume that the 4 October 2019 email would be effective in bringing the SD to the appellant’s attention. The appellant’s solicitors in fact confirmed that the appellant had notice of the SD at around the time the 4 October 2019 email was sent (GD at [35]). While the appellant referred to para 33(6) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (“Supreme Court PD”) (see [46] below), neither this nor O 62 r 5(4) ROC exhaustively set out the requirements of substituted service by way of email (GD at [36]). The requirements for valid service are circumscribed by pragmatism and not by an overtly rigid and technical approach (GD at [37], citing <span class="font-italic">Re Ramaschayana Sulistyo</span> <span class="font-italic">(alias Chang Whe Ming)</span>, ex parte <span class="font-italic">The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd and other appeals </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 483 (“<span class="font-italic">Sulistyo</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10] and [21]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Given the Judge’s finding that substituted service was validly effected on 4 October 2019, the Application (to set aside the SD) was made out of time. It ought to have been made within 14 days from the date of service of the SD on 4 October 2019, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by 18 October 2019 (r 97(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BR). Instead, it was filed on 31 October 2019. The Judge did not make a clear finding on whether an extension of time should be granted, instead considering that this question was “ultimately rendered moot” by his conclusion that the application to set aside the SD was without merit (GD at [55]) (see [18] below). Nevertheless, the Judge observed that the delay of almost two weeks was not insubstantial and that the appellant did not give any reasons for it. It appeared that the appellant had made a deliberate and tactical decision to wait until B 2786 had been filed before taking any action (GD at [35] and [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Aside from finding that there had been valid service of the SD, the Judge also rejected the other grounds on which the appellant sought to set aside the SD. Specifically, the Judge held that taxation is the exclusive judicial recourse available to any challenge over the quantum of the defendant’s fees (following <span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2015] 5 SLR 722 (“<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56]–[57]). The appellant did not file an appeal against the court’s decision in OS 67/19 that he was not entitled to an order for taxation for the 26 October 2017 invoice, and that was the end of the matter in relation to whether the 26 October 2017 invoice could be challenged. The appellant’s arguments were a blatant attempt to circumvent the order of Abdullah J in OS 67/19 (GD at [44]). There was also no valid or genuine cross-demand equivalent to or exceeding the debt arising from the setting-off of deposits held by the respondent against the sum invoiced. While the explanation that there had been a telephone conversation in which Optimus Chambers agreed that the respondent was to utilise the funds held as part payment of the 26 October 2017 invoice had not been given on affidavit, there was no reason to disregard or disbelieve the explanation (GD at [42] and [51]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ submissions on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 First, the appellant seeks to set aside the SD pursuant to r 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the BR, under which the court shall set aside a statutory demand if it is satisfied it ought to be set aside. In this regard, the appellant argues that there has not been valid service of the SD. The appellant argues that the Advertisement was not good service since advertising in the newspapers is only allowed under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR when the modes prescribed in r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are unavailable due to the creditor’s ignorance of the debtor’s last known address. The Judge erred in considering that the Advertisement was valid service under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the BR since this interpretation rendered r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) otiose, which could not have been the intention of the Rules Committee.

</div> The arguments made on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR were therefore focused on the question as to whether the respondent can rely on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) in <span class="font-italic">advertising</span> <span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-italic">notice of the SD</span>.

Two questions arise: (a) when a creditor should be considered to have no knowledge of the debtor’s last known address; and (b) what an “advertisement of the statutory demand” entails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Last known address</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The first question is what knowledge of the debtor’s last known address entails. In particular, where a creditor once knew of the debtor’s residence, business or place of employment, the question is whether he should be considered as having knowledge of the debtor’s last known address <span class="font-italic">even if </span>he knows, or has good reason to believe, that the debtor no longer lives, carries out business, or works there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We note that at [13] of <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong</span> ([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), S Rajendran J said that “even if [the debtor] was in fact no longer residing at that address, it would not detract from the fact that that was the last known place of residence of [the debtor] in so far as the [creditor] was concerned”. In so holding, Rajendran J also stated that the fact the debtor was not the registered owner of the premises did not indicate in any way that he was not resident at the premises. However, in context, that might have been because the registered owner in that case was a company (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong </span>at [9]) and the company might have been owned by the debtor or the debtor could have been residing there pursuant to a licence or lease conferred by the company. For completeness, while <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong </span>considered an earlier version of the BR, specifically, the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R1, 1996 Rev Ed), r 96(4) was identical in both versions and we therefore do not distinguish between them in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The last known address should be interpreted to mean the last address at which the person is known or believed to be located or residing at. Any other previous address would be knowledge of a fact of historic interest that has nothing to do with the purpose of the provisions on service in the BR, which is to bring the statutory demand to the notice of the debtor, as we explain below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) reflects a legislative choice to prefer the methods of service provided for in rr 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) over substituted service by means of advertisement. This preference would be contrary to the purpose of the service requirements <span class="font-italic">and</span> the creditor’s obligation to take all reasonable steps to bring the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention (see r 96(1) of the BR) if the reference to the debtor’s last known address is fulfilled simply by virtue of the fact that he knows of a previous address even though the debtor no longer resides there. Therefore, in our view, the reference to the last known address in r 96 must be to an address which is still believed to be applicable. If that address is known or believed no longer to be applicable, then it ceases to be the last known address for the purpose of r 96.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, the respondent had learnt from a title search of the Bayshore Road property done on 5 September 2019 that the property had been transferred from the appellant to a third-party purchaser.

</div> This transfer was not in dispute. The ordinary inference is that the appellant no longer resides there and there was nothing to rebut that inference. Indeed, the appellant does not say that he continued to reside there. Therefore, the Bayshore Road property had ceased to be the last known address of the appellant and, in the absence of any other known address, the respondent would not have been able to rely on rr 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Hence, contrary to what the respondent and the Judge had thought, the respondent could have relied on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to effect service by advertisement in a local newspaper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Requirement of advertisement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The next question is what “advertisement of the statutory demand” in r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) means. This could mean either that: (a) the statutory demand <span class="font-italic">itself</span> must be advertised or (b) that a notice of the statutory demand may be advertised. In our view, the former is not mandatory and the latter would be in keeping with the purpose of the provisions on service.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In interpreting r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BR, regard must be had to the purpose of the provisions on service. The Judge held that the overarching intention or purpose underlying the service requirements is to provide the practical means for the creditor to bring effective notice of the statutory demand to the debtor (at [25] and [37]). We agree: this is reflected in the provisions of r 96 of the BR.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The overarching rules for service are set out in r 96(1) and r 96(3) of the BR. The former states that the creditor shall take all reasonable steps to bring the statutory demand to the debtor’s attention. The latter states that where the creditor is not able to effect personal service, the demand may be served by “such other means as would be most effective in bringing the demand to the notice of the debtor”. The mode of substituted service must also be one that the court would have ordered in the circumstances (r 96(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BR). In this connection, reference may be had to para 33(1) of the Supreme Court PD, which provides that in an application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the court that the proposed method of substituted service will probably be effectual in bringing the document in question to the notice of the person to be served. Indeed, r 108(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BR expressly requires that a bankruptcy application be accompanied by a supporting affidavit stating the means whereby, if the statutory demand had been served other than by personal service, the creditor sought to bring the demand to the debtor’s attention and <span class="font-italic">explain why such means would have best ensured that the demand would be brought to the debtor’s attention</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 These provisions underscore the court’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Sulistyo</span> ([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [21] that the essence of the service requirements under the BR is to ensure that the statutory demand, bankruptcy application and other relevant processes are brought to the personal attention of the debtor prior to the hearing of the application. This is particularly so given the serious consequences that a bankruptcy order, if granted, may have for a debtor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong</span> ([14] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), on its face, may be taken as suggesting a restrictive view of the “advertisement” requirement. In that case, Rajendran J held that the creditor bank could not rely on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to effect substituted service by advertising the statutory demand in a newspaper since it knew what Rajendran J considered to be the last known address of the debtor. Since the bank knew that a firm of solicitors, M/s Wee Tay &amp; Lim, was acting for the debtor, the bank should have tried to communicate the statutory demand to the debtor through M/s Wee Tay &amp; Lim (at [12]–[14]). However, even if the bank could rely on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), that provision required the bank to advertise the statutory demand and <span class="font-italic">not </span>a notice of it. In this regard, Rajendran J said that (at [15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if a creditor wants to take advantage of the provisions in the [BR] relating to substituted service, that creditor would have to comply with the procedures specified. The [BR] did not authorise the creditor to vary the procedure laid down on the grounds of costs or on any other grounds. <span class="font-italic">In this case the bank, by advertising a notice of the statutory demand and not the statutory demand itself, had not complied with r 96(4)(</span>c<span class="font-italic">) of the </span><span class="font-italic">[BR]. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Rajendran J further held that non-compliance with r 96 should not be treated as an irregularity or a formal defect which can be cured under s 158(1) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) because the peremptory language in the BR was clear indication that the intention was to make compliance with the rules relating to service mandatory (at [18]). As such, the defect in the service of the statutory demand could not be cured under s 158(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and the statutory demand had to be set aside (at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On its face, the remarks made in <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong </span>on r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) are suggestive of a stringent and technical approach towards the requirements set out in that provision. However, in the later case of <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Ishak bin Ismail </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [9], Rajendran J stated that <span class="font-italic">Wong Kwei Cheong </span>had been decided on the basis that there had been a more effective and appropriate way to effect service which the creditors had ignored. It was for this reason that the creditors were not entitled to rely on service by advertisement. Rajendran J further clarified that where there are clearly better modes of service other than those enumerated in r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) BR, the pre-requisite of two attempts at personal service does not absolve creditors from exploring those avenues. This is consistent with the underlying purpose we have identified above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In our view, the literal meaning of “advertisement of the statutory demand” in r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) BR is that the statutory demand itself must be included in the advertisement. However, a possible interpretation, consistent with the language of the provision, is that it suffices if the advertisement is sufficient to bring the demand to the attention of the debtor. This latter interpretation accords with the purpose of the provision. There is no meaningful difference between the advertisement of a statutory demand itself or of a notice thereof. The latter is adequate if it contains the material information such as the name of the creditor, the date of the invoice or the nature of the claim, and the amount that is allegedly owing together with information as to who the debtor may contact if he wishes to obtain the statutory demand. To insist that a creditor must advertise the statutory demand itself is to require him to incur more costs with no apparent benefit to either the creditor or the debtor. In --------<span class="font-italic">The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v Rasmachayana Sulistyo alias Chang Whe Ming </span>[2004] SGHC 87 at [11] and [12], an AR held that a purposive interpretation of r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) supports the conclusion that the advertisement of the notice of a statutory demand can constitute an “advertisement of the statutory demand”. We agree. Accordingly, we hold that advertisement of a notice of a statutory demand can be sufficient to comply with r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) so long as the material information is stated therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, the advertised notice indicated that the SD was issued pursuant to a claim for “S$106,133.52 as at 30 September 2019 being the amount due and owing by [the appellant] pursuant to the [respondent’s 26 October 2017 invoice]”. The notice stated the amount of debt that accrued as at the date of the demand, as would have been done if the statutory demand itself had been advertised. The notice also referred to the possibility of a bankruptcy application being filed if the debt were not paid, secured or compounded within 21 days of the notice and stated that an application to set aside must be made within 14 days from the date of the notice. It further provided the respondent’s address and indicated that the SD could be obtained from the respondent’s office.

</div> The material information had been stated in the advertised notice. Indeed, the appellant does not contend that the notice contained inadequate or incorrect information.

Nevertheless, there was valid service in the present circumstances under r 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) given that the respondent had, in addition to advertising the notice in the Straits Times, also sent a copy of the notice to Cairnhill Law on 4 October 2019. Cairnhill Law had then been acting for the appellant in the taxation of the bill of costs in respect of the 13 March 2018 invoice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The appellant asserts that the email to Cairnhill Law would not have been a mode of service which the court would have ordered in an application for substituted service of an originating summons in the circumstances.

Just as substituted service <span class="font-italic">may</span> be effected by posting on the main door of an address of, say, the closest relative of a debtor (where, for example, the creditor does not know the debtor’s last known address, as we have defined it above), substituted service <span class="font-italic">may</span> also be effected by sending an email to the address of someone whom it is reasonably believed will bring the email to the attention of the debtor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the present case, Cairnhill Law was acting for the appellant in the taxation of the 13 March 2018 invoice.

</div> Before the Judge, the appellant submitted that there were two “tactics” that could be taken when a statutory demand is served: namely, to actively take steps to set it aside, or to wait for the creditor to file the bankruptcy application before filing an application to set aside the SD. The explanation was that if the appellant had alerted the respondent to the perceived deficiencies in the manner in which it had attempted to serve the SD, the respondent would have rectified them and then proceeded to file the bankruptcy application.

</div> Before us, it was submitted that Cairnhill Law had looked at the SD, considered that service had not been valid and taken the view that it could wait to raise a challenge. While there was an allusion to Cairnhill Law having been busy with the taxation of the 13 March 2018 invoice and an oblique remark to the effect that there would have been additional costs involved in applying to set aside the SD at an earlier stage, the main thrust of the appellant’s position before us was that the delay was due to the tactical decision mentioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As we explained at the hearing of the appeal, this was not a case in which the appellant had failed to apply to set aside the SD on time due to an oversight or for some valid reason. In this regard, whether or not the view taken by Cairnhill Law on the validity of service was reasonable on the authorities then available was, with respect, beside the point. The appellant, on the advice of Cairnhill Law, had made the calculated and tactical decision not to bring the requisite application within time, notwithstanding the fact that the SD had been brought to his notice on or about 4 October 2019. This militates against the granting of an extension of time since the need for this was entirely of the appellant’s own choosing. Having (wrongly) assessed that there had not been proper service, the appellant decided to run the risk of allowing the time for setting aside to lapse. In the circumstances, there was no good reason for the delay. It was a deliberate attempt to make things as difficult as possible for the respondent which the appellant might have achieved to some extent if the SD were to be set aside, or if B 2786, the respondent’s bankruptcy application, filed more than 21 days after 14 October 2017, were to be dismissed on the basis that the SD had not been validly served. This is sufficient to dispose of the second issue, but for completeness we go on to explain why the grounds the appellant relies on to set aside the SD also do not persuade us that the extension of time sought should be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grounds for setting aside the SD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We turn now to examine the grounds on which the appellant seeks to set aside the SD, which, in our view, similarly suggest that an extension of time should not be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Aside from his arguments on the validity of service, the appellant also contends that the SD should be set aside because (a) the quantum of the debt is disputed; (b) he has a cross-demand that exceeds the debt under the SD; and (c) there was an implied term which disentitles the respondent from payment in the present case. We address these in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The disputed quantum and the taxation scheme under s 122 of the LPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The question is whether the appellant may challenge the quantum of the 26 October 2017 invoice when he has not obtained an order for taxation under s 122 of the LPA within time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Judge agreed with the observation in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56]–[57] that taxation is the only judicial avenue for recourse available to the appellant to challenge the quantum of the respondent’s fees. Pertinently, the appellant sought an order to tax the 26 October 2017 invoice in OS 67/19 and did not appeal against the Abdullah J’s dismissal of his application to obtain an order for taxation out of time. The Judge found that that was the end of the matter in relation to whether the 26 October 2017 invoice could be challenged (GD at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The appellant argues that there is no reason why he should have only one year to challenge the 26 October 2017 invoice, as opposed to the usual six-year limitation period for contractual claims.

At the time <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>was decided, s 70 provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Where before the expiration of one month from the delivery of a solicitor’s bill an application is made by the party chargeable with the bill, the High Court shall, without requiring any sum to be paid into court, order that the bill be taxed and that no action be commenced on the bill until the taxation is completed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where no such application is made before the expiration of the period mentioned in subsection (1), then, on an application being made by the solicitor or, subject to subsections (3) and (4), by the party chargeable with the bill, the court may on such terms, if any, as it thinks fit (not being terms as to the costs of the taxation), order – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) that the bill be taxed; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that no action be commenced on the bill, and that any action already commenced be stayed, until the taxation is completed. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where an application under subsection (2) is made by the party chargeable with the bill – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) after the expiration of 12 months from the delivery of the bill, or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) after a judgment has been obtained for the recovery of the costs covered by the bill, or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) after the bill has been paid, but before the expiration of 12 months from the payment of the bill,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">no order shall be made except in special circumstances and, if an order is made, it may contain such terms as regards the costs of the taxation as the court may think fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The power to order taxation conferred by subsection (2) shall not be exercisable on an application made by the party chargeable with the bill after the expiration of 12 months from the payment of the bill.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The English Court of Appeal held that the 1974 Act introduced a more convenient and advantageous taxation procedure and did not remove the “common law right to defend an action by the solicitor for his fees” (at 42). The court observed that the 1974 Act did not state that its effect was to exclude “the client’s common law right to object to paying more than a reasonable sum for the solicitor’s services, if he does not avail himself of the statutory procedures” (at 46). Further, s 70(2) contemplated that the solicitor would bring an action on the bill in order to enforce payment. The court held that the 1974 Act did not take away the need for the solicitor to prove that his fees are reasonable, if they are challenged, absent any express agreement as to what they should be. This would not disadvantage the solicitor, who may claim an order for taxation without any time limit, and thereafter obtain a form of summary judgment when the taxation certificate is issued. The court also held that the solicitor’s claim is one for a <span class="font-italic">reasonable sum</span> under both statute and the common law, and not for a liquidated sum, and the burden of proving that the sum is reasonable rests upon the solicitor (at 48 and 51–52). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was said to follow prior decisions which adopted the same position. For example, <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> referred to Stirling J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Park </span>(1888) 41 Ch D 326 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Park</span>”) at 331 and 332, where Stirling J held that, in dealing with solicitors’ costs, the court has a three-fold jurisdiction. First, the statutory jurisdiction conferred by the Solicitors Acts, which does apply where the time limit for taxation has expired and there are no special circumstances which justify making a taxation order. Second, the court has general jurisdiction over the officers of the court, which confers jurisdiction to deal with solicitors’ bill of costs. Third (at 332): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">there remains the ordinary jurisdiction of the Court in dealing with contested claims. This action is one for the administration of a testator’s estate … It is contended on their behalf that the investigation of this claim which takes place in Chambers is merely in substitution for a common law action, and that the Claimants ought to be placed as nearly as may be, having regard to the different forms of procedure, in the position in which they would have been if they had brought an action at common law against the testator’s legal personal representative for the amount of this bill. To that general proposition I agree. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We note that in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Park</span>, the solicitors’ bills were eventually referred to the Taxing Master to assess the appropriate quantum even though they were not sent for taxation as such because more than 12 months had lapsed since the delivery of the bills. In other words, the appropriate quantum was in any event, not to be determined at a trial. Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, the bills of costs were not to be determined at a trial. They were referred to a costs judge for assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The question before us is whether a client may challenge a solicitor’s bill notwithstanding his omission to seek taxation within the period prescribed in s 122 of the LPA. Put in another way, is the client’s contractual right to defend against a solicitor’s claim for services rendered an available alternative to the taxation mechanism in s 122 of the LPA? In this regard, we acknowledge that ss 118 and 119 of the LPA refer to the commencement of actions by solicitors in relation to the bill:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Solicitor not to commence action for fees until one month after delivery of bills</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">118.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—</span>(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, no solicitor shall, except by leave of the court, <span class="font-italic">commence or maintain any action for the recovery of any costs due for any business done by him until the expiration of one month after</span> he has delivered to the party to be charged therewith, or sent by post to, or left with him at his office or place of business, dwelling-house or last known place of residence, a bill of those costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Court may authorise action for recovery of fees before expiration of one month after delivery of bills</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">119. </span><span class="font-italic">The court may authorise a solicitor to commence an action for the recovery of his costs and also refer his bill of costs for taxation by the Registrar,</span> although one month has not expired from the delivery of the bill, upon proof to its satisfaction that any party chargeable therewith is about to quit Singapore, or to have a receiving order made against him, or to compound with his creditors or to take any other steps or do any other act which in its opinion would tend to defeat or delay the solicitor in obtaining payment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Such provisions appear to have been a factor in the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 46). With respect, in our view, the fact that these provisions envisage the bringing of an action for the recovery of fees does not indicate, one way or another, whether taxation is the only avenue by which a court may review the reasonableness of the solicitor’s bill. Two issues may be distinguished: the <span class="font-italic">method </span>of recovery (whether this is by commencing an action or through bankruptcy proceedings), and the avenues by which the court may assess the reasonableness of the sum charged.

Solicitors are subject to this unique procedure for resolving fee disputes for two reasons.

</div> it was held that these provisions exist to provide certainty for <span class="font-italic">both</span> the solicitor and client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We also note that the 12-month time limit provided for in s 122 of the LPA is not cast in stone. An order may be made for taxation outside of the specified period if the court finds that there are “special circumstances” to so order. From the client’s perspective, this provides an additional safeguard. As Coomaraswamy J held in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61], there is no rigid rule as to what kind of circumstances are sufficiently special to justify taxation of a solicitor’s bill. Where it is apparent that there has been overcharging, this would be a factor militating in favour of granting an order for taxation, even if the s 122 of the LPA time limit has elapsed (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay </span>at [28(b)]). Similarly, if the bills delivered are so lacking in particulars that the client is unable to make an informed decision as to whether to apply for taxation, or if the solicitor did not inform the client of the right to have the bill taxed, the court may lean in favour of ordering taxation, if this is appropriate in all the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We add that for the purpose of s 122 of the LPA, the interest of the client is adequately protected if “special circumstances” is not construed narrowly against the client. After all, the provision is not intended to allow or encourage solicitors to take advantage of ignorant or unsuspecting clients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The silence of the LPA on the <span class="font-italic">consequences </span>of failing to seek a taxation order within the 12-month period is equivocal. In contrast, an unqualified common law right to defend against a claim brought by solicitors in respect of an untaxed invoice would mean that there is a twin track to challenge a solicitor’s charges, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by seeking taxation pursuant to s 122 of the LPA or by the common law right to defend. In our view, this would undermine the statutory 12-month period in s 122 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Accordingly, there is no twin track. The common law right to defend is qualified by s 122 of the LPA. Generally speaking, a client is to seek an order for taxation of a solicitor’s bill of costs within 12 months from delivery of the bill or show special circumstances why an order for taxation should be made outside of the 12-month period. As the appellant has not obtained an order for taxation, he is precluded from challenging the amount claimed in the SD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The appellant’s substantive submissions on the point that the 26 October 2017 invoice is for an excessive sum also meet the same fate. First, the appellant contended that “substantial errors” were discovered in the taxation of the 13 March 2018 invoice and that there may be inaccuracies in relation to the time recorded for the period covered by the 26 October 2017 invoice, which would in turn mean that the amount of professional fees charged under that invoice may be inaccurate.

</div>
</div> As a general proposition, errors discovered in the 13 March 2018 invoice would not necessarily suggest that similar errors were made in the 26 October 2017 invoice. Furthermore, it is not open to the appellant to resist the SD on such a general argument when he had failed to obtain an order for taxation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Second, the appellant attempted to estimate the reasonable amount of time the respondent would have expended on each item of work done as set out in the 26 October 2017 invoice and to provide an approximate figure for the professional fees the respondent could have reasonably charged.

</div>
</div> However, this is not an appropriate exercise to undertake at this stage of the proceedings. In essence, this is a backdoor attempt to tax the bill notwithstanding the decision in OS 67/19, which is impermissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Third, the appellant also raised a more specific point. Specifically, the Letter of Engagement signed by the appellant indicated that the respondent’s fees would be based on the actual time spent in connection with the Consolidated Suits, with specified hourly rates for certain solicitors who were identified therein. The hourly rate for Mr Edmund Eng (“Mr Eng”) was stipulated to be $720.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, in the taxation of the 13 March 2018 invoice, the appellant discovered that the respondent had instead used an hourly rate of $790 for Mr Eng. The inference from this was that Mr Eng’s rate of $790 was <span class="font-italic">also </span>used for the 26 October 2017 invoice, which covered the period immediately preceding that of the 23 March 2018 invoice. The respondent appeared to accept that Mr Eng’s time had been charged at $790 per hour in the 26 October 2017 invoice. However, it submitted that under cl 2.1 of the General Terms and Conditions applicable to the Letter of Engagement, it was entitled to adjust the hourly rate from time to time. On the other hand, cl 9 of the Letter of Engagement stated that the respondent would notify the appellant of any changes to the hourly rates.

</div>
</div>
</div> It was undisputed that the respondent did not notify the appellant of the change in the hourly rate for Mr Eng. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Although the respondent suggested that it was entitled to claim the higher rate despite its failure to notify the appellant of the higher rate, we are of the view that this was an arguable point which, in ordinary circumstances, the appellant would have been entitled to contest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, the difficulty for the appellant was that he had already questioned the aggregate original amount claimed in the 26 October 2017 invoice soon after it was rendered, even though he was apparently unaware of the higher rate being charged for Mr Eng. As we have elaborated above, he was informed of his right to taxation more than once and he was eventually represented by new solicitors from whom he could have sought advice on the question of taxation if he wanted to. Yet, despite his concerns over the quantum of fees charged, he did nothing to pursue taxation until he filed OS 67/19 on 15 January 2019. Had he pursued his right to taxation on time, it was likely that he would have learned of the higher rate in the ordinary course of taxation. His attempts to persuade Abdullah J that there were special circumstances supporting his application for an order for taxation of the 26 October 2017 invoice were unsuccessful and consequently his application for that relief was dismissed. Abdullah J observed that the fact that the trial of the Consolidated Suits had been underway at that point in time was not sufficient reason not to proceed as required by the law, and that any negotiations or alleged lack of particularisation in the 26 October 2017 invoice similarly did not constitute special circumstances under s 122 of the LPA.

</div> the appellant stated that he was under the impression that the respondent would apply for taxation. We are of the view that as the respondent had repeatedly informed him of his right to pursue taxation and he also had access to advice from new solicitors, this was a feeble excuse which he raised for the first time then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Furthermore, the appellant was not merely seeking a reduction of the amount claimed under the 26 October 2017 invoice by the difference of $70 per hour for Mr Eng multiplied by the number of hours he was engaged in. The appellant was using that difference to dispute the entire invoice. His counsel informed us that he was prepared to proceed with taxation. However, bearing in mind his earlier failure to seek taxation and the dismissal of his application in OS 67/19 for an order of taxation and the absence of an appeal against that dismissal, we are of the view that it was too late for the appellant to now seek taxation. Also, he was not entitled to use the higher rate as a reason to stave off the SD. That said, we leave it to the respondent to consider whether it wishes to waive its claim for the difference in respect of the 26 October 2017 invoice as it did not notify the appellant of the increase.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cross-demand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 We now come to the appellant’s arguments on an alleged cross-demand.

Mr Goh stated that there had been an agreement reached during a telephone conversation between the respondent and Optimus Chambers for the respondent to utilise the funds in part payment of the 26 October 2017 invoice in order to stop or reduce interest from running on that invoice. Allegedly, it was pursuant to this agreement that the deposit totalling $176,025.30 was set off against the debt arising from the 26 October 2017 invoice (see GD at [42]).

He further observed that Mr Goh was from the entity which had issued the SD.

</div> However, there was no mention of any oral agreement to set off, whether in that conversation or any subsequent telephone conversation. In fairness, we note that this may be because at the time that affidavit was executed, the set-off had either not been effected or the appellant had not yet complained about it.

If he were correct, the respondent would have to issue a fresh statutory demand for the original higher sum, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without set-off, and he would be liable for the higher sum with interest. There would have been no benefit to him except to cause the respondent to incur more costs and delay matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the circumstances, we are of the view that he does not have a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> cross-demand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Implied term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The appellant seeks leave to raise a new argument, namely, that there was an implied term that the respondent had to provide the appellant with a breakdown of the time costs, and that, having failed to do so, the respondent was not entitled to payment.

</div>
</div> If the invoice had been taxed, the bill of costs filed would have provided the taxing registrar (and the appellant) with ample basis on which to assess whether or not the sums claimed were reasonable, failing which the appellant would have been justified in asking for further information to be provided. It is therefore difficult to see how there is a “gap” in the contract that is not filled by cl 5.4 and the appellant’s right to tax the invoices within 12 months from receipt of the invoice in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Furthermore, it is not necessary to imply such a term to ensure business efficacy between the parties. At most, one could say that the respondent is obliged to provide the breakdown upon timely request by the appellant but not in the absence of such a request. Here, the appellant did not ask for the breakdown until recently when his right to seek taxation had long ceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Accordingly, the appellant’s argument on the implied term fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Finally, we agree that there is no undue prejudice to the respondent if we were to grant the appellant an extension of time to file the Application. However, that is only one factor which is much less important than the reason for the delay and the lack of merit in his arguments to set aside the SD. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary on Issue 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In the circumstances, there was no good reason to allow the appellant an extension of time to file the Application late. The grounds on which he attempts to set aside the SD are in any event unmeritorious. His application for an extension of time is refused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The BR provides detailed provisions to ensure that a statutory demand is brought to the notice of a debtor. The Application is short on merit and undeserving of sympathy for various reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 First, the appellant is not saying that the SD was not brought to his notice. Even before the formal service of the SD on 4 October 2019, he was aware that the respondent was seeking to serve an SD on him (see [7] above). Thereafter, he sought to set aside the service of the SD not because he was genuinely caught unawares and wanted more time to pay the debt. He simply wanted to make the respondent incur more costs by re-starting the process again and delay matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Secondly, instead of pursuing his right to seek taxation at the appropriate time, he chose to sit on his right. Thereafter, when it was too late for him to do so, he sought an order to tax the 26 October 2017 invoice but failed. He then attempted to challenge the amount claimed with arguments which reflected his lack of <span class="font-italic">bona</span> <span class="font-italic">fides</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $24,000 (including disbursements) to be paid by the appellant to the respondent. The usual consequential orders are to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For the avoidance of doubt, the respondent may proceed with B 2786 filed on 29 October 2019 and need not file a fresh bankruptcy application. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon    Tay Yong Kwang     Woo Bih Li<br/>Chief Justice     Judge of Appeal     Judge<br/></div><div
