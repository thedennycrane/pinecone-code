</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1 The first Plaintiff ("Baridhi") is a

company registered in Bangladesh. At all material times it was, and still is, the agent in

Bangladesh for Evergreen Marine Corporation (Taiwan) Ltd ("EMC"), a Taiwanese

main line operator that manages and operates numerous vessels worldwide. As agent, Baridhi

promotes and manages the business of EMC in Bangladesh, including securing shipping

contracts for EMC.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2 The second Plaintiff ("HRC"), also a

Bangladeshi company, is in the business of transporting cargo but on a smaller scale

compared to EMC’s operations. Its mode of operation is to contract with major lines,

such as EMC, to transport cargo out of Bangladesh to another country where that cargo

would be loaded into larger vessels belonging to EMC for carriage to the final

destination. For cargo destined for Bangladesh, HRC would pick up such cargo from EMC

vessels and convey them to Bangladeshi ports. HRC and operators like it are called

"feeder operators".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3 The first Defendant ("SCPL") is a company

registered in Singapore. It is a feeder operator like HRC and is its competitor in

Bangladesh. The second Defendant ("Wong") is a director of SCPL. The Plaintiffs

allege that in respect of the acts complained of, Wong had acted in the course of his

employment or had done so for and on behalf of SCPL.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4 The Statement of Claim alleges that Wong had published

an e-mail dated 6 April 2001 which contained words that are defamatory of the Plaintiffs.

The e-mail was sent to, <i>inter alia</i>, officers of EMC in Taiwan, an officer of RTW

Shipping (S) Pte Ltd which is the agent for EMC in Singapore, and the office of the agent

of EMC in Sri Lanka. The Plaintiffs’ claim is in damages, including special damages

and exemplary damages. In 4 and 5 of the Statement of Claim the Plaintiffs explained

the background to that e-mail in this manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">4. The 1st Defendant was to have transported certain

    cargo out of Bangladesh for EMC. However, had it done so, it would have been in breach of

    the Bangladesh Flag Vessels (Protection) Shipping Ordinance, 1982 ("the

    Ordinance") construed together with the Notification dated 26 September 1982 in the

    Bangladesh Gazette. This was because being a foreign entity in Bangladesh, the 1st

    Defendant did not have the requisite waiver under the Ordinance. Hence the 1st Plaintiff

    arranged for the said cargo to be transported instead by the 2nd Plaintiff. Being owners

    and operators of Bangladeshi flag vessels, the 2nd Plaintiff did not and does not need to

    procure such a waiver.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">5. When EMC queried why the said cargo was transported

    by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff and not the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the 1<sup>st</sup>

    Plaintiff explained in e-mails dated 16 March 2001 and 22 March 2001. However, the 2<sup>nd</sup>

    Defendant disagreed with the explanation in his e-mails dated 19 March 2001 and 6 April

    2001.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5 The e-mail of 6 April 2001, in essence, stated that

the issue of the legality of using SCPL to carry the cargo was just the pretext upon which

Baridhi diverted cargo to HRC. Wong had alleged in the e-mail that the legislation in

question was an outdated one which was originally enacted to protect the Bangladesh

Shipping Corporation. He deposed that HRC, being a private shipping company was not the

national line and it was not the intention of the legislation to protect such companies.

However HRC and other private lines had been taking advantage of the legislation by

putting undue pressure on the Director-General (Shipping) in Bangladesh to reject waivers

for foreign vessels like those of SCPL. The e-mail ended in the following manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">HRC are going about on a malicious campaign, trying to

    get these age old rules implemented, which is totally against the principles of Modern day

    Trade and the Globalisation market.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">For your info, your agent in Bangladesh have a very Bad

    name in the market and their doings have in fact a negative image on themselves. If you

    study the movement of EMC bxs in the past few years, there is a drop. Martin, if you

    require to qualify our sources, pls check and confirm thru some independent sources about

    HRC’s reputation in Bangladesh.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Please do not quote this message to HRC directly.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6 The Plaintiffs pleaded that the words in the e-mail,

in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) Baridhi had lied to EMC and/or has distorted the

    truth in its explanation to EMC as to why       SCPL was not

    engaged to transport the cargo in question;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) Baridhi was incompetent and inefficient and had a

    bad business reputation;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) HRC had lied to the Director-General (Shipping) or

    had distorted the truth about

    the                

    legislation;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) HRC had been dishonest, exploitative and had

    conducted its business in an improper manner.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">SIC 1513/2001</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7 The writ in this action was filed on 18 June 2001 and

served on 20 June on the Defendants in Singapore. On 4 July 2001 the Defendants took out

an application in SIC 1513/2001 to stay the action on the ground that Bangladesh is the

more appropriate forum. Two supporting affidavits were filed by Lim Kin Seng

("Lim"), the legal officer of SCPL. He related the background to the dealings

that SCPL had with Baridhi and HRC. SCPL had been operating feeder services in Bangladesh

since 1989 and between 1995 and 2000, Baridhi was SCPL’s agent in Bangladesh. However

SCPL terminated this arrangement with effect from 15 April 2000 and appointed a new agent,

Everbest Shipping Agencies Ltd ("Everbest"). SCPL believed that Baridhi began to

allocate EMC cargo to HRC, which started feeder operations only in 1997. HRC had somehow

persuaded the Director-General (Shipping) not to issue waiver certificates to foreign

feeder operators such as SCPL. Without such certificates, a foreign operator of feeder

services would be liable to punishment by a fine up to the value of the cargo. Lim stated

that it was obvious that HRC had sought to eliminate competition by unfair means through

the use of the said legislation. After taking legal advice in Bangladesh, SCPL, through

its agent Everbest, commenced legal proceedings on 27 March 2001 in Bangladesh against the

Director-General (Shipping) and others in Writ Petition No.992 of 2001. One of the

remedies sought was a declaration that the Director-General was to refrain from refusing

to grant waiver certificates under the influence of HRC. On 27 March 2001, the Bangladeshi

High Court made an interim order that the Director-General was not to refuse any waiver

for a period of two months. However on application by HRC on 8 May 2001, this order was

stayed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8 As to the e-mail in question, Lim deposed that EMC

had, around September 2000 and pursuant to SCPL’s request, instructed HRC to share

out the cargo load for the Chittagong-Colombo sector in the proportion 60:40 in favour of

SCPL. However despite this HRC continued blatantly to object to the issuance of waiver

certificates by the Director-General (Shipping), and then cited the lack of a waiver as

the excuse for not sharing out the cargo. Because of this, Martin Chen ("Chen")

of EMC sent an e-mail on 4 April 2001 to EMC’s agent in Singapore and Colombo

instructing them to stop booking on HRC vessels until further notice. This e-mail was also

sent to HRC for its comments. HRC responded on 5 April by e-mail to Chen, saying that it

did not share out the cargo with SCPL because of the refusal of the Director-General to

grant waivers. HRC claimed that it was for the protection of EMC’s interests that it

did not load on SCPL’s vessels. Chen forwarded this e-mail to SCPL for its response,

which it gave in the form of the offending e-mail of 6 April 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3"> 9 The Defendants contend that the matter has

little or no connection with Singapore because it was published here to only one person

whereas it was also published in Taipei, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the

matter had substantial connection with Bangladesh because:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) the feeder route involved was the Chittagong-Colombo

    sector;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) the dispute concerns the interpretation of

    Bangaldeshi legislation;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) there was litigation pending in Bangladesh in

    respect of the powers of the Director-General (Shipping) with regard to the legislation;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) HRC is resident in Bangladesh and its reputation is

    mainly in Bangladesh;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(e) evidence to prove justification of the statements in

    the e-mail would be more conveniently adduced in Bangladesh than Singapore.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">RA 214/2001</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10 The Defendants’ application was heard by the

Senior Assistant Registrar on 26 October 2001. He ruled in favour of the Defendants and

stayed the present action. The Plaintiffs appealed against that decision in RA 214/2001. I

heard the appeal on 17 January 2002 and dismissed it. However in the course of the appeal

the Plaintiffs had produced the opinion of an expert on Bangladeshi law stating that the

defamation action could not be maintained in Bangladesh. The Defendants disputed this and

produced their own expert to depose to the contrary. However I note that the opinion is

not expressed in unambiguous terms. It states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The Code of Civil Procedure in force in Bangladesh

    provides any dispute including defamation will be adjudicated under the Jurisdiction of

    Bangladesh Courts irrespective of nationality. I have read paragraph 6 of the

    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in Suit No. 756/2001/E (the Singapore proceedings).

    The allegation is related to Bangladeshi laws and the alleged injury to the plaintiff is

    also within the territory of the Bangladesh. I think this subject matter of dispute should

    be determined in Bangladesh on consideration of relevant oral, documentary and

    circumstantial evidences which are all available in Bangladesh.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">In view of this, I gave leave to the Plaintiffs to apply

to lift the stay in the event that the Defendants challenge the jurisdiction of the

Bangladeshi court or assert there that there is no cause of action in Bangladesh.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The Present Application: SIC 837/2002</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11 The Plaintiffs took out the present application on 21

March 2002 to lift the stay in view of certain developments since their appeal was

dismissed in January. These are set out in the affidavit of Foo Say Nong ("Foo")

of 19 March 2002. He deposed that shortly after their appeal was dismissed on 17 January

2002, the Plaintiffs commenced an action in the Bangaldeshi court on 7 February. The

Plaintiffs exhibited a copy of the plaint they had filed in the Court of the 5<sup>th</sup>

Joint District Judge, Dhaka which named both the Defendants in the present action as

defendants. The plaint is on substantially the same terms as the Statement of Claim in

this action. However on 20 February the Joint District Judge of the 5<sup>th</sup> Court

in Dhaka made the following order:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">This is a suit for defamation and damage. Suit valued at

    Tk. 10 Crore. Advelorem Court fee of Tk. 28,750/- paid with the plaint. Related documents

    photo-copies filed by the plaintiff as per firisti. It appears from the averment made in

    the plaint. That the cause of action arose in Singapore due to Publication of the e-mail

    on 6<sup>th</sup> April, 2001. The defendants are also the resident of Singapore and do

    not have any residence or asset in Bangladesh. So, the Court or any Court of Bangladesh do

    not have jurisdiction to proceed with or try with the case as per law. This suit is

    triable in Singapore under relevant law of Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Hence, the plaint be returned to the plaintiffs through

    their learned lawyer for presentation before the proper Court of jurisdiction in

    Singapore.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12 In view of the position taken by the 5<sup>th</sup>

District Court of Dhaka, the Plaintiffs made this application to lift the stay ordered by

the Senior Assistant Registrar on 26 October 2001 which I had affirmed on 17 January 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13 The nub of the dispute is whether the e-mail of 6

April 2001 contains statements defamatory of the Plaintiffs, and if so, whether a defence

of justification can be made out. As to the meaning of the words complained of, there is

no difference whether the suit is heard in Singapore or Bangladesh. On the question of

damages, the main recipients concerned are the officers of EMC in Taiwan, of RTW Shipping

(S) Pte Ltd in Singapore, and EMC’s office in Sri Lanka. Hence on that point,

Bangladesh has no significant advantage over Singapore. Counsel for the Defendants had

stated that the defences available were justification and qualified privilege. It was on

the defence of justification that substantial advantage could be derived from having the

action heard in Bangladesh as there were issues relating to Bangladeshi legislation, in

particular whether the ordinance in question was applicable to HRC. The Plaintiffs pointed

out that SCPL had taken out proceedings in the Bangladesh High Court against the

Director-General (Shipping) which decision would resolve that issue. In determining the

appeal, I was of the view that Bangladesh would be the more appropriate forum as a

question of Bangladeshi law would require to be determined. For that reason I dismissed

the Plaintiffs’ appeal against the stay granted by the Senior Assistant Registrar on

26 October 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14 However, the Plaintiffs are now faced with a ruling

of the Bangladeshi court which states that they have no cause of action against the

Defendants in Bangladesh. Counsel for the Defendants pointed out that the Defendants took

no steps to oppose or challenge jurisdiction. That may be true but the fact remains that

it is a decision of the Bangladeshi court. The Plaintiffs had in their first application

for stay adduced evidence to the effect that they had no cause of action in Bangladesh.

This was by way of an opinion from their Bangladeshi counsel. However this was

contradicted by the Defendants’ expert and I had considered that the Plaintiffs had

not proved their assertion on this point. Now the Plaintiffs have a clear ruling by the

Bangladeshi court that they had no cause of action in Bangladesh. To my query, counsel for

the Defendants was unable to say that there was any evidence of fraud. The plaint

exhibited appears to show substantially what is in the Statement of Claim in the present

action. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved that

they have no cause of action in Bangladesh.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15 Simply put, the Plaintiffs’ case is that not

only is Bangladesh not the more appropriate forum, it is not even a possible forum. It is

the Defendants who have to satisfy the court that Bangladesh is the more appropriate

forum. In <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44166&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 253</a> the

plaintiff was a trading company based in Singapore and the defendants were an Indian

insurance company with a registered office in Singapore. The Court of Appeal held at 22

that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">… where a Singapore court has jurisdiction as of

    right, it must be convinced that the foreign court is so clearly and distinctly more

    appropriate that it would justify the court's decision to deny the plaintiffs their day in

    a Singapore court.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">In the present case the Plaintiffs have commenced

proceedings in Singapore and have properly served the writ on the Defendants here. The

Bangladeshi court has decided that it has no jurisdiction. The burden rests on the

Defendants to show that Bangladesh is the more appropriate forum. On the evidence before

me, they have clearly not done so.</font></p>
