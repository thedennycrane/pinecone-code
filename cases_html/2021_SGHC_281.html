The applicant who seeks to establish contempt of court has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (s 28 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) (“APA”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In deciding whether contempt has been committed, the court will first decide what exactly the order of court required the alleged contemnor to do (or to refrain from doing). In determining what the order of court required, the court will interpret the plain meaning of the language used, and it will resolve any ambiguity in favour of the person who had to comply with the order. Second, the court will determine whether the requirements of the order of court have been fulfilled. The complainant will need to show that in committing the act complained of or omitting to comply with an order of court, the alleged contemnor had the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 4 SLR 828 (“<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala</span>”) at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The threshold to establish the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>is a low one. It is only necessary for the complainant to show that the relevant conduct of the alleged contemnor was intentional and that the alleged contemnor knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order – this includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms. It is not necessary for the complainant to show that the alleged contemnor appreciated he was breaching the order: the motive or intention of the alleged contemnor and his reasons for disobedience are irrelevant to the issue of liability and are relevant only to the issue of mitigation. The liability is strict in the sense that all that is required to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent omission by the alleged contemnor to comply with the order (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala </span>at [47]–[48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 As the breaches complained of in this case occurred outside Singapore and the plaintiff currently resides outside Singapore, I also note in the interests of completeness that under section 11(4) of the APA, the court has jurisdiction to try any contempt of court and to impose the full punishment under the APA, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the person who commits contempt of court under section 4 of the APA is legally bound to obey or comply with the judgment, direction  or an order of court or an undertaking given to a court, regardless of whether the disobedience or failure to comply occurred in Singapore or elsewhere. It is not disputed that the plaintiff is legally bound to obey and to comply with the injunction. Section 12(6) of the APA further provides that “[t]o avoid doubt, the court may, if the interests of justice so require, find a person guilty of contempt of court and impose the punishment under this section even though the person is absent”.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first alleged breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I now turn to the first alleged breach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The 1st defendant submits that the plaintiff had introduced one Mr David Magdic (“Magdic”), the Head of People Experience at Virgin Australia, to Ms Barb Hyman (“Hyman”), the CEO of PredictiveHire, which is a Melbourne-based AI recruitment startup;

The plaintiff said in his affidavit that he had known Hyman since about 2004, that Hyman had joined PredictiveHire as CEO in February 2018, that Hyman had reconnected with him on 18 January 2021 because she had seen an article in the Australian Financial Review about him joining Virgin Australia, and that before that, they had not spoken for 10 years.

</div> The plaintiff’s email to Magdic on 25 May 2021 informed the latter that PredictiveHire was “doing awesome things around using AI in recruitment, <span class="font-italic">particularly in positions like Cabin crew</span>” [emphasis added], described the advantages of the technology offered by PredictiveHire (which included more efficiency “especially for volume recruitment”), and even went on to note that Qantas, his former employer, “actually uses them for Cabin crew recruitment I think”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Looking at the evidence as a whole leads me to the following findings. First, the plaintiff and Hyman reconnected because she found out that he was joining Virgin Australia.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-765b9857-2f77-4de9-a12e-9d225621fcc7" data-toggle="modal" type="button">22</button></sup>

<div class="modal-body">
<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  DWS at para 28(b).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The context in which they reconnected was thus not a social or personal one, but was based on the plaintiff’s business connection to Virgin Australia. Second, the plaintiff was well aware that he was introducing Hyman (the CEO of an “AI recruitment startup”) to Magdic (the Head of People Experience at Virgin Australia), so that Hyman could promote Predictive Hire’s AI recruitment services to Virgin Australia. Indeed, prior to linking the two up on email, the plaintiff had set the stage by explaining to Magdic that he wanted to connect Magdic to an “ex-colleague…who does awesome stuff in AI recruitment”. Third, in introducing Hyman to Magdic, the plaintiff himself apprised Magdic of Hyman’s PredictiveHire technology; the advantages it offered an employer in the recruitment process, “particularly in positions like Cabin crew” and “for volume recruitment”; and the fact that “Qantas actually uses them for Cabin crew recruitment”.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff’s comment that PredictiveHire’s technology offered more efficiency “especially for volume recruitment” was picked up on by Hyman who then suggested to Magdic in her follow-up email that she could “pop in” on Magdic to “see if our tech can be of help to you and the team especially as you scale back up”. In short, therefore, in sending his email of 25 May 2021, the plaintiff had involved himself in helping Virgin Australia with its recruitment process as Virgin Australia sought to scale back up following its acquisition by Bain Capital. This clearly amounted to involving himself in the activity or business, directly, of Virgin Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In his affidavit, the plaintiff tried to downplay the significance of his actions: he said he did not benefit at all from introducing Hyman and Magdic, and that his intention was simply to do Hyman a “small favour”, “in relation to a matter concerning her own and not [Virgin Australia’s] business”.

He added that Baart had “an excellent great rolodex of talented folks who have moved on from Qantas Loyalty, and is keen to help [Virgin Australia].” On that basis, Lawson suggested that Hrdlicka introduce Baart to the plaintiff and “suggest they catch up”.

</div> Lastly, there was a clear degree of planning by the plaintiff with regard to the coordination of Virgin Australia’s approach to Baart. In the plaintiff’s email reply to Hrdlicka and Burquest, he specifically proposed to Burquest that he should meet with Baart first before introducing her to Burquest.

My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 First, it should be noted that the plaintiff’s meeting with Baart came about following an email sent by Lawson (a representative of Bain Capital, the owner of Virgin Australia) to Hrdlicka (the CEO of Virgin Australia). Lawson’s email highlighted Baart’s “excellent” contacts, her plans to leave her then employer, and the thinking she had been doing about “what could be done to make Velocity great”. This was followed by the proposal that Baart should be introduced to the plaintiff (the incoming CEO of Velocity) and to Burquest (Virgin Australia’s Chief People Officer). Lawson’s email to Hrdlicka was thus plainly sent in the context of Virgin Australia’s business. The suggestion Lawson made in that context, for the plaintiff to “catch up” with Baart, plainly contemplated that any engagement by the plaintiff of Baart would not be for a purely social purpose, but would be to facilitate Virgin Australia’s further engagement of Baart for the purpose of recruiting her and/or other “talented folks” for Velocity’s business. I do not think it can be disputed that the plaintiff would have been aware of the context in which it was being suggested that he meet with Baart, since Lawson’s email was forwarded to him by Hrdlicka, who added her observation that Baart was a “rock star” who had “the added bonus of understanding a loyalty business”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I have considered whether it may be argued that the plaintiff was only asked to “catch up” with Baart, whereas it was Burquest who was tasked with checking whether Baart had “any interesting leads for roles” that Virgin Australia was “looking to fill right now”; in other words, that Burquest’s role was related to Virgin Australia’s business, whereas the plaintiff’s was not. I do not accept any such characterisation of the plaintiff’s role. The plaintiff did not know Baart prior to being asked to meet her. There was simply no reason for him to be involved in the email exchange and to be asked to “catch up” with Baart, <span class="font-italic">apart </span>from his role as the incoming CEO of Virgin Australia’s loyalty business, and Baart’s usefulness to that business as a potential hire and/or a source of information about other talent in the market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In fact, in Hrdlicka’s email of 27 June 2021 to the plaintiff and Burquest, Hrdlicka expressly pointed out that meeting Baart “would be great for both [the plaintiff and Burquest] in the event that we need talent in the Velocity biz”. Clearly, Hrdlicka was asking the plaintiff and Burquest to meet with Baart either because Baart herself was a potential recruit for the Velocity business, and/or because Baart could inform them about potential talent for the Velocity business. I add that whilst Hrdlicka added that “[o]bviously for [the plaintiff] this can only be a social engagement”, this statement was qualified by her express observation that meeting with Baart would help the plaintiff in “getting to know talent in the market” – an observation which showed that the meeting would not simply be for the purpose of a social “catch up”. Getting to know talent in the market would be fundamental for the business of Virgin Australia, and even more so for the plaintiff as the incoming CEO of Velocity.

</div> In other words, the plaintiff carried out Hrdlicka’s request in the 27 June 2021 email for him to “[get] to know talent in the market”, the “talent” in question being the “rock star” Baart herself; and by getting to know Baart, he established a professional connection that would allow Burquest (the Chief People Officer of Virgin Australia) to follow up with Baart later on, either to recruit her directly or to obtain information from her about other talent which the Velocity business might benefit from hiring. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I reiterate that the plaintiff did not know Baart socially prior to being asked by Hrdlicka to meet her. As I said earlier at [30], there was no reason for him to meet Baart, absent the context of Virgin Australia’s business and activity; and I reject his claims that his meeting with Baart was merely a “social catch-up”.

It should be noted that the main focus of the news release was the appointment of one Dave Emerson (“Emerson”) as Virgin Australia’s Chief Commercial Officer; and it was clear from the contents of the news release that as at 9 June 2021, Emerson was not yet a member of the ELT, since it was expressly stated that he “<span class="font-italic">is currently</span> a Senior Partner” at Bain and Company and “<span class="font-italic">will join</span> [Virgin Australia’s] Executive Leadership Team” [emphasis added].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I find no merit in the plaintiff’s argument that the terms of the injunction are ambiguous or that they can potentially be understood to cover things that have not the remotest connection with the business or activities of Virgin Australia. This is not a case for any genuine doubt about what the court’s purpose in granting the injunction was (<span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> Anthony Sabastian v Sembcorp Marine Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [74]). This is not at all a case like <span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA),</span> where it was unclear whether the Assistant Registrar – in granting an interim sealing order in respect of “Mr Wong Weng Sun’s 5th supporting affidavit dated 26 November 2010” – intended to seal the 5th affidavit which was actually dated 3 December 2010, or the 4th affidavit which was dated 26 November 2010 (at [77]). In the present case, the phrase “involved in any activity or business of, directly or indirectly, Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd or its related bodies corporate” is preceded and qualified by the words “or being otherwise”, which in turn references the preceding phrase “commencing work for, rendering services to, being employed by”. It would have been clear that the references to involvement “in any activity or business of, directly or indirectly” had to be read in the context of the preceding restrictions, and that these references would not – indeed, could not – include things which had not the remotest connection with Virgin Australia’s business or activities (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, taking a Virgin Airlines flight to get from Japan to Australia). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Quite apart from the lack of ambiguity in the terms of the injunction, it is clear that the plaintiff himself has never been in any danger of being confused or misguided about what he was enjoined from doing. From the explanations proffered in the plaintiff’s affidavit to justify his actions <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Hyman and Baart, it is clear that the plaintiff was (and is) well aware of the difference between conduct that would amount to a breach of the injunction and conduct that would not. Thus, for example, in relation to the Baart incident, he took pains to try to downplay the significance of Hrdlicka’s 27 June 2021 email, insisted that his meeting with Baart was purely a social catch-up, and sought to emphasise in some detail his efforts to avoid all mention of Virgin Australia during the meeting. I add that the 1st defendant’s application for the injunction was heard <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">partes</span> on 29 April 2021, with the plaintiff being represented by counsel. It was not suggested by the plaintiff at the hearing that the terms of the injunction as prayed for were unclear or ambiguous, or that he did not understand what they required him to do or to refrain from doing, or that they went beyond what was necessary to protect the 1st defendant’s legitimate interests. Nor, in the six months since, has the plaintiff attempted to vary or set aside the injunction on the basis that its terms are unclear or ambiguous or that they go beyond what was necessary to protect the 1st defendant’s legitimate interests. To raise such an argument now is really to attempt a much belated collateral attack on the court’s orders. I find these arguments to be without merit, and I reject them accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having found that the plaintiff committed two of the three alleged breaches, I find that he has breached the terms of the injunction by involving himself in the business and activity, directly, of Virgin Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I now turn to the appropriate sentence to be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Section 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the APA provides that where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the General Division of the High Court (as in the present case), a person who commits contempt of court shall<span class="font-italic"> </span>be liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with both.

Wei J also held that, in determining the appropriate sanction, the court should consider whether the contemnor has taken steps since the breach to purge the contempt (at [77]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala</span>, the two contemnors had breached three orders for the examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) by failing to appear at the EJD  hearings or to answer the EJD questionnaires or to provide any documents or books relevant to their assets at the time of the breaches (at [50]–[51]). Wei J sentenced the two contemnors to seven days’ imprisonment each (at [88]). In so doing, he took into account the fact that while both contemnors had eventually provided answers to the EJD questionnaires, these answers comprised bare denials of assets and income with almost no information or details provided, which did little to mitigate, let alone purge, the contempt (at [77]). He also noted their lack of genuine remorse and failure to take real and substantial steps to address the breaches (at [83]). Wei J found that the breaches were serious and repeated, the delay caused was considerable, and the alleged contemnors remained unwilling to answer questions on their personal assets (at [85]). The contemnors’ appeal to the CA was dismissed (with no written grounds of decision).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Wei J also referred to several other cases where the court had imposed a custodial term. I summarise these as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Aurol Anthony Sabastian </span>[2013] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> Anthony</span>”), the High Court imposed a sentence of five days’ imprisonment (at [89]). Following a review of the case law, the High Court noted that the following principles were relevant in sentencing: the attitude behind the contemptuous behaviour, the motive for committing the contemptuous act, whether a fine would have been an adequate deterrent, the reversibility of the breach, the standard of care expected of the individual, the nature of the contemptuous act, whether the contemnor was remorseful, and whether the contemnor had procured others to commit the contemptuous act (at [68]). The court found that the alleged contemnor, Mr Aurol (“Aurol”), had deliberately and cynically breached an interim sealing order (at [70]), and had been less than forthright throughout the hearings (at [72]). Aurol had forwarded the sealed documents to a journalist, one Mr Raj, whom Aurol knew had published unfavourable articles about the applicant in the past, and Aurol did not inform Mr Raj that the documents were sealed. The court found that Aurol had thereby enticed Mr Raj to publish an article based on the sealed documents (at [78], [81]). The court, however, held that a lengthy custodial sentence was not necessary or desirable as Aurol’s breach was a “once and for all breach”, no financial damage was caused to the applicant, and Aurol was not an officer of the court (at [86]–[88]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, I note that Aurol’s appeal was allowed by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Aurol</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, on the ground that the terms of the interim sealing order were ambiguous (at [84], [96]), but the CA did not disagree with the sentencing principles articulated by the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Global Distressed Alpha Fund</span><span class="font-italic"> I Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo </span>[2013] SGHC 105 (“<span class="font-italic">Global Distressed Alpha Fund</span>”), the High Court imposed a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment (at [59]). In that case, the contemnor had failed to attend the EJD hearings on eight occasions (at [37]–[49]), and had been late in responding to the questionnaire on his assets (at [52]). The court noted that the contemnor’s conduct had prevented the judgment creditor from taking substantive steps to realise the fruits of its litigation (at [55]), and the contemnor had evinced no remorse for his actions (at [57]). On checking, however, I note that there was an appeal from the High Court’s decision in Civil Appeal No 41 of 2013, which was heard before the CA on 4 November 2013. The CA set aside the custodial sentence and imposed instead a fine of $25,000. No written grounds of decision were issued by the CA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In <span class="font-italic">Tahir v </span><span class="font-italic">Tay Kar Oon </span>[2016] 3 SLR 296, the High Court imposed a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment (at [67]). The contemnor had breached orders requiring her to attend two scheduled court hearings and to provide answers to an EJD questionnaire (at [5]–[11]). The contemnor admitted liability at the committal proceedings (at [18]), and sentencing was adjourned three times to allow her time to purge the contempt (at [21], [26], [29]). At the final hearing, the applicant applied for leave to withdraw his committal application as he was satisfied that the contempt had been substantially purged (at [31]). The court found that the applicant had suffered real prejudice by virtue of the contempt, which was not capable of remedy (at [53]), and that the contemnor had made no genuine attempts to cooperate and comply with court orders (at [54]). The contemnor’s concealment of additional breaches was persistent even when great leeway had been given to allow her to purge the contempt (at [66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On appeal, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tay Kar </span><span class="font-italic">Oon v Tahir </span>[2017] 2 SLR 342 set aside the imprisonment term and imposed a fine of $10,000 (or, in default, ten days’ imprisonment) (at [63]). In so doing, the CA took into consideration the fact that the contemnor appeared to have substantially purged the contempt by complying with the various orders and directions (at [57]); the applicant had suffered little, if any, discernible prejudice from the contemnor’s failure to comply with the directions (at [59]); and the contemnor suffered from major depressive disorder at the time of the various breaches, which appeared to have hampered her ability to deal with the various legal proceedings she was facing (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 60, the High Court imposed a custodial sentence of six months on each of the contemnors (at [37]). The High Court found that the contemnors had failed to comply with clear and unambiguous orders of which they had notice, under a Mareva injunction granted by the court (at [2]–[3], [30]). They also absented themselves from court on both of the days fixed for cross-examination (at [31]–[32]). Lastly, the court found that the contemnors had not purged their contempt, and remained uncooperative, deliberate and contumacious in breaching the terms of the orders (at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Lastly, <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>(which the High Court in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala </span>cited and followed) was a civil contempt matter arising from divorce proceedings. The husband in that case had a history of acting in flagrant disregard of judgments or orders made by various courts at all levels: his breaches included acting in disregard of an injunction against dissipating, disposing of and/or otherwise dealing with property as well as acting in disregard of orders to pay specified maintenance amounts to the wife (at [52]). Noting that “[a]lmost all the egregious factors which were employed by the courts to impose a stiff sentence on the contemnors” in previous cases could be found on the facts before it, and finding moreover that the husband’s non-compliance was “both <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> and <span class="font-italic">fraudulent</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [111]–[112]), the CA imposed a suspended sentence of eight months’ imprisonment. As the husband failed to take advantage of the suspension period to effect compliance with the court order, he was subsequently taken into custody to serve the sentence (at [117]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the present case, as a matter of principle, I accept the 1st defendant’s submission that the sentence to be imposed serves two functions: the first is a punitive function, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the plaintiff is punished for disobeying a court order; the second is one of general deterrence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> persons who might be inclined to disobey court orders are deterred from doing so by the knowledge of the potential sanctions.

The plaintiff himself has not suggested he was acting under pressure.  There is also no evidence of the plaintiff having been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others; nor has he made such a suggestion. Further, given my findings at [18] and [33] in respect of the Hyman incident and the Baart incident, it is clear that the plaintiff’s breaches were deliberate and intentional. In this connection, it is also clear that regrettably, the plaintiff appears not to appreciate the seriousness of the deliberate breach: the apology offered towards the end of his affidavit – while it purports to be “unreserved” – persists in characterising his own behaviour as inadvertent and unintentional.

</div> In addition, considering that I have found two instances of a breach of the injunction, the plaintiff bears quite a high degree of culpability. In the circumstances, this is not a suitable case for imposing no punishment at all (as submitted by the plaintiff).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On the other hand, although the 1st defendant has described the plaintiff’s breaches as having been committed “surreptitiously” and “away from the public eye”,

</div> it is not clear to me what the 1st defendant meant to convey by that remark. It is not suggested, for example, that the plaintiff’s interactions with Hyman, Magdic, Hrdlicka and Baart were conducted in a clandestine or secret manner. Nor was this a case where the contemnor sought to conceal or obfuscate the documentary trail he was leaving. Ultimately, it seems to me all the 1st defendant meant was that it had not been aware of the plaintiff’s breaches at the time they were committed and had come to know of them only afterwards. Whilst this would be relevant to the issue of reversibility of any harm or prejudice caused, I do not think it qualifies as “surreptitious” behaviour on the plaintiff’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As to the issue of prejudice, although the 1st defendant’s written submissions repeatedly asserted that it had been irreversibly prejudiced as a result of the plaintiff’s conduct, it was unable precisely to identify what prejudice this was.

Whether a fine is sufficient punishment in any case will depend on the court’s evaluation of the various sentencing factors in that case. I add that I do not agree that in principle, a fine can never amount to sufficient deterrence to other persons who might be minded to breach similar orders of court.
