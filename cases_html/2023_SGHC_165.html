</div> He explained that he referred to the black bundles as “stones” because that was the term Raja used. He first met Raja about two months before the date of the offence. Raja approached Kumaran in a coffee shop in Skudai and asked him if he was a lorry driver. When Kumaran replied in the affirmative, Raja asked Kumaran if he could help deliver stuff into Singapore. Kumaran was suspicious that Raja was asking him to deliver illegal items, and rejected Raja. Raja approached Kumaran at the same coffee shop again about two weeks later. This time, Kumaran gave Raja his phone number as Raja said he could help Kumaran secure a better job.

</div> About three weeks later, Kumaran received a phone call from Raja asking if he wanted a job with a better pay. Raja said that he heard that Kumaran was facing financial difficulties and that he could help Kumaran financially. After Kumaran replied “yes, I needed money”, Raja told him that he would be informed “if there is good news”. Three days later, Raja again called Kumaran and proposed that if Kumaran could help him deliver things, Kumaran would be paid RM 300 for one “stone”. When Kumaran asked what these “stones” were, Raja replied that they contained “some taxable electronic items”. When Kumaran pressed further, Raja replied that “it is some cheap item, just don’t open it up”. Kumaran agreed to do the delivery as Raja was prepared to pay RM 300 per “stone”. On the day Kumaran agreed to the delivery, Raja came to meet him and passed him a Nokia handphone and a SIM card. Raja told Kumaran that he would contact him through this phone, and instructed him not to use his own handphone to contact Raja.

The first time he mentioned Kesavan was in a statement he gave on 3 April 2018, almost three years after his arrest and about a month before trial was due to commence. I agreed with the Prosecution that this late introduction of Kesavan in Kumaran’s story was an afterthought, aimed at plugging a gap in his story concerning why he was so trusting of Raja as to be prepared to transport what he knew to be illegal items without opening up the packages to check what they actually were. The crux of Kumaran’s defence at trial was that he trusted Kesavan who told him that he would be delivering “chips” (for which tax was unpaid). At trial, Kumaran referred to the earlier statements he gave in 2015 and explained that he had mentioned Raja’s name and “hidden” any information of Kesavan because he wanted to “protect” Kesavan.

</div> What this shows is that, even though Jayacelan and Hashim may not have met or known each other personally, they were communicating with each other to coordinate delivery of some illicit item (which Jayacelan claimed he believed to be “black money” and which the Prosecution alleged were controlled drugs). This proves that Hashim was waiting for a delivery from Jayacelan, and the red plastic bag transported by Jayacelan was intended for Hashim. There were simply no other plastic bags involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The evidence recounted in the preceding three paragraphs point inevitably and inexorably to the conclusion that the plastic bag transported by Jayacelan was the same plastic bag retrieved by Hashim. Any suggestion that these were two different plastic bags does not rise above the level of casting merely a fanciful doubt. I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Jayacelan transported the Plastic Bag, containing the Drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Jayacelan knew the nature of the Drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  As I have found that Jayacelan was transporting the Plastic Bag containing the Drugs, and therefore in possession of the Drugs, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was triggered. The burden therefore fell on Jayacelan to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know the Plastic Bag contained diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Jayacelan’s account of events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As noted above, Jayacelan’s case was that he was asked by one Sutha to collect the Plastic Bag from Kumaran’s trailer and drop it into the Open Dustbin at the Carpark. According to Jayacelan, he first got to know Sutha about two months before the date of the offence at a coffee shop in Malaysia through a mutual friend, Suresh. At this very first meeting with Sutha, Suresh informed Jayacelan that Sutha was involved in money laundering. As Jayacelan ran a freelance business installing CCTVs in Malaysia, he gave his name card to both Suresh and Sutha and asked them to refer potential customers to him. About a week later, Sutha referred the first customer to Jayacelan. In all, Jayacelan received three referrals from Sutha and did not pay any commission or reward to Sutha for his referrals.

Sutha asked this because he knew that Jayacelan commuted between Malaysia and Singapore daily for work. When Jayacelan indicated that he was going into Singapore, Sutha asked Jayacelan for a favour, which was to collect a plastic bag from a Malaysian trailer in Tuas and then to place it in a specific dustbin at the Carpark. Jayacelan asked what would be in the plastic bag, to which Sutha replied that it was “undeclared money” relating to Sutha’s money laundering activities. Sutha explained that he asked Jayacelan because he could not find anyone else to help. Jayacelan agreed to help because he felt indebted to Sutha for the three customers Sutha referred to him.

During examination-in-chief, Jayacelan said he was “shocked” to be arrested by CNB when he was under the impression that all he did was to transport “black money”, not drugs.

However, the officer did not accept his answer and insisted that he was transporting drugs. That was when he decided to simply say he did not know.

Counsel for Jayacelan’s cross-examination of SSgt Meenambikhai was brief and consisted simply of clarifying SSgt Meenambikhai’s handwriting in the contemporaneous statement.

</div> In the light of this factual matrix, I did not find it credible for Jayacelan to have any reasonable basis to develop sufficient trust in Sutha to take the latter’s word concerning “black money” or “undeclared money” at face value without checking the contents of the Plastic Bag himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for Jayacelan’s claim that he was not in financial need, although he tendered in evidence the business registration certificates of the two businesses he referred to, he has provided no evidence concerning his income to substantiate his claim that his total monthly income was in the region of RM 14,000 to RM 15,000. In any event, this claim that Jayacelan was not in financial need was neither here nor there—even assuming I accepted his assertion (which I did not) that he was earning RM 14,000 to RM 15,000 per month, this raised a question why Jayacelan would be willing to take on the risk of delivering the supposed “black money” simply because Sutha had referred three customers to Jayacelan’s CCTV business. Jayacelan explained that he trusted Sutha because “he’s a good man and he has helped me” and “because of that gratitude, I helped him”,

However, Jayacelan testified that he would have made about RM 3,000 in total from the three referrals, over a period of approximately one and a half months.

A question therefore arose as to whether s 247 of the CPC was still applicable since the defence had already closed its case and made its closing submission. Having regard to s 230 of the CPC, which describes the procedure to be followed at trial, I took the view that a trial is not over until either the accused is found not guilty and acquitted or the accused is found guilty and sentenced. Since neither of these events had occurred, the power under s 247 of the CPC remained available to the court notwithstanding that the defence had already closed its case and made its closing submission.

Consequently, I stayed the proceedings against Hashim pursuant to s 248(2) of the CPC and reported the case to the Minister for Law pursuant to s 249 of the CPC. The Minister subsequently ordered that Hashim be confined in the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) until further notice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The case against Azuin (the 3rd Accused)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Azuin was arrested with the Plastic Bag, containing the Drugs, in his possession.

Dr Koh examined Azuin on 24 July 2015, 30 July 2015 and 3 August 2015 for the purpose of assessing, among other things, Azuin’s fitness to plead. That assessment was set out in a report dated 4 August 2015, in which Dr Koh also gave the opinion that, apart from polysubstance misuse, Azuin had “no other major mental disorder” (“First Report”).

</div> After Dr Lam produced her report, the Prosecution sought Dr Koh’s comment on it. Dr Koh gave his comments in a report dated 18 February 2019 (“Second Report”). In that report, Dr Koh agreed with Dr Lam that Azuin had opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder at the time of the offence. However, he did not agree that Azuin had persistent depressive disorder at the time of the offence. Dr Koh noted that the accounts given by Azuin and his sister to Dr Koh were in sharp contrast to what they told Dr Lam, and that the difference of opinion between Dr Lam and Dr Koh appeared to have been the result of “opposing statements” given by Azuin to Dr Lam and Dr Koh.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having observed both Azuin and his sister in the witness box, and having regard to the matters discussed above, I was convinced that both Azuin and his sister were lying to Dr Lam when they made claims about Azuin’s mental condition and symptoms which were diametrically opposed to what they told Dr Koh. For this reason, I found Dr Lam’s report unreliable and placed no weight on it. My conclusion in this regard was buttressed by the fact that Azuin had stated, in his long statement dated 16 July 2015, that he started smoking heroin and “Ice” again about six months prior to his arrest “for fun” and that “[t]ill now, I am still smoking ‘Ice’ for fun”.

</div>
</div> I found this to be a convenient afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It remains for me to deal with three criticisms levelled against Dr Koh by counsel for Azuin. The first criticism was that, in comparison to Dr Lam who spent a total of seven hours interviewing Azuin, Dr Koh only spent a total of 105 minutes doing so, of which merely 30 minutes were devoted specifically to assessing Azuin for mood symptoms. Counsel submitted that Dr Koh could not have possibly been able to fully assess Azuin and arrive at an accurate diagnosis within such a short timeframe.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, for the court to decide whether to give weight to Dr Koh’s assessment, the relevant question is not whether Dr Koh had spent more or less time with Azuin than Dr Lam. Instead, the question is whether Dr Koh had spent an adequate amount of time and made an adequate level of inquiry to arrive at his assessment. In this regard, I note that Azuin had not adduced evidence to demonstrate that the amount of time which Dr Koh spent with Azuin was insufficient for an accurate assessment to be made. In any event, having regard to the matters narrated at [67]–[69] above, I was satisfied that Dr Koh had gone into a significant level of detail during his interview with Azuin concerning the presence of mood symptoms. I therefore did not find merit in this first criticism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The second criticism was Dr Koh’s decision not to interview Azuin again after receiving Dr Lam’s and before issuing his Second Report.

</div> During cross-examination, Dr Lam explained that the persistent depressive disorder would have impaired Azuin’s judgement, decision-making and impulse control. When asked what she meant by “judgement”, Dr Lam explained that she was referring to whether Azuin should have gone to collect the Plastic Bag.

There was no evidence linking the alleged moderate persistent depressive disorder to Azuin’s decision to accept the assignment to collect and deliver drugs on the day of the offence. First, Dr Lam’s suggestion that Azuin was operating on “auto-pilot” mode was not borne out by the evidence. The evidence demonstrated that Azuin was able to decide to accept the assignment, take a taxi to a bus interchange near the Carpark before making his way to the Carpark on foot, recognise the person whom he was supposed to meet and then pick up the Plastic Bag after the person pointed it out. Second, Azuin gave evidence that he was involved in drug trafficking because it was lucrative, and that he would not take part in drug trafficking if the amount of money involved was small.
