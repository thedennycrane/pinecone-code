Having done so, pursuant to s 392(4) of the CPC, I now set out the effect, if any, the additional evidence taken has on my earlier verdict. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The trial   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The accused was convicted of a charge of possession of not less than 54.04g of diamorphine (“the Drugs”) for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The mandatory sentence of death was passed on him. My reasons are contained in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Mohamed Shalleh bin Abdul Latiff </span>[2019] SGHC 93 (“GD”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the trial, the Prosecution’s evidence showed that on 11 August 2016, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) conducted an operation in the vicinity of Balestier Road and Boon Teck Road, and later arrested the accused in his car along Mei Ling Street: see [4]-[7] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 As stated at [8] of the GD, upon a search of the accused’s car, the CNB officers recovered the following items from the floorboard of the front passenger seat: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) one orange plastic bag which contained one “Lexus” box which in turn contained two packets of crystalline substance; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) three zip-lock bags each containing one bundle wrapped in brown paper. The three bundles are to be collectively referred to as the “Bundles”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The contents of the Bundles were analysed and found to contain the Drugs, while the crystalline substance in the two packets was found to contain methamphetamine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 It was not disputed by the accused that in collecting the Drugs, the accused followed the instructions of one “Bai”, pursuant to an agreement that the accused would do a delivery job for Bai. As per Bai’s instructions, on the day of his arrest, the accused met with Mr Khairul to receive the goods at Boon Teck Street. The accused also passed Mr Khairul an envelope containing S$7,000. Then, the accused proceeded to Mei Ling Street to await further instructions about who to deliver the Bundles to. Before the accused could complete the delivery, he was arrested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In his defence, the accused disputed having knowledge of the nature of the drugs, alleging that he believed that the delivery involved contraband cigarettes. The key reason why the accused had allegedly formed this belief was because Bai had told him that the delivery job involved contraband cigarettes, and the accused trusted Bai’s word: see [14] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As part of his defence, the accused claimed that he did not see the Bundles until they were recovered by the CNB officers. Mr Khairul had delivered them to him in the orange plastic bag with the handles tied up. The orange plastic bag was placed on the floorboard of the front passenger seat of the car. Thus, the Bundles were not visible to him: see [14(d)] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On this aspect, the accused’s evidence was contradicted by Senior Staff Sergeant Tay Keng Chye (“SSSgt Tay”). According to SSSgt Tay, following the arrest, he found the orange plastic bag <span class="font-italic">beside </span>the Bundles on the floorboard of the front passenger seat of the car: see [9] of the GD. In other words, the Bundles – which were roughly palm-sized, round and irregularly shaped – were outside the orange plastic bag.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 As possession of the Drugs was undisputed, the Prosecution was able to rely on the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA. Having reviewed the evidence, I found that the accused had failed to rebut this presumption for reasons which fell into three broad areas:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The evidence showed that the accused did not have a close relationship with Bai, and there was no reason for the high level of trust he allegedly placed in Bai given the suspicious circumstances of the transaction: see [23]-[27] and [39] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I also observed that the accused had omitted to mention important aspects of his defence in his statements made in the course of investigations: see [28]-[34] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Further, I found that the accused’s account was contradicted by SSSgt Tay’s evidence. I saw no reason to disbelieve SSSgt Tay’s evidence, and accepted that the Bundles were in fact located outside the orange plastic bag when they were found by SSSgt Tay. As the Bundles were left exposed on the floorboard, the accused would have caught sight of their appearance. The round and irregular shape should have aroused the accused’s suspicion that they contained something else besides cartons of cigarettes: see [36]-[37] and [39] of the GD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Having rejected the accused’s defence, I convicted him of the charge. I should add that at the close of the Prosecution’s case, Mr Khairul was offered as a witness to the defence. However, he was not called as a witness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The application   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 After the trial, the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Nabill</span>”) was released. The Prosecution noted that Mr Khairul could be considered a material witness as he was in the position to testify whether the Bundles were inside or outside the orange plastic bag. This issue had some bearing on whether the accused had knowledge of the Drugs. If the Bundles had been left exposed, their round and irregular shape would have aroused the accused’s suspicion that the contents were not cartons of cigarettes. Therefore, in accordance with <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span>, the Prosecution disclosed to the Defence the statements made to the CNB by Mr Khairul. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Subsequently, for the purpose of the appeal, the Defence applied for Mr Khairul to give evidence on the two following issues: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether Mr Khairul placed the orange plastic bag on the floorboard of the car; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If Mr Khairul did so, whether the Bundles were within the orange plastic bag or outside the orange plastic bag.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Prosecution did not object to the Defence’s application. As stated at [1] above, the application was granted, and the matter was remitted to me for additional evidence to be taken from Mr Khairul on the two issues.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Khairul’s evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Mr Khairul was arrested on 11 August 2016.

This was after Mr Khairul was asked to explain why his DNA had been found on the inside of one of the packets of ice. In Exh D6, Mr Khairul admitted that prior to his arrest, he had been helping to deliver “drug” to the accused. He received the money as payment for the “drug”. However, Mr Khairul continued to deny that he had anything to do with the Bundles. In court, he explained that by “drug”, he meant “meth” <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>methamphetamine.

</div> In other words, Mr Khairul’s evidence did not advance the defence. The further evidence should have no bearing on the court’s earlier findings.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I agree with the parties that Mr Khairul is not a credible witness. Until the DNA evidence linked him to the packets of methamphetamine, Mr Khairul did not admit to any delivery to the accused at all. After being confronted with the DNA evidence, he admitted to the delivery of the packets of methamphetamine. His initial version was contrary to the evidence in court.  Clearly, he had lied in his initial statements to protect himself. Mr Khairul admitted to this. Therefore, I find his credit impeached pursuant to the Defence’s application under s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act. Further, it is evident that Mr Khairul has an incentive to continue to disassociate himself from the Bundles. Any admission of involvement with the delivery of the Bundles would implicate him in the commission of a capital offence. Generally, I do not find him a reliable witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning to the two issues set out at [13] above, Mr Khairul’s evidence did not support the accused’s version of the events. Contrary to the parties’ common position, Mr Khairul denied that he had delivered the Bundles to the accused. To do so, it is unsurprising that Mr Khairul said that when he entered the accused’s car, the Bundles were already on the front passenger seat which Mr Khairul then pushed to the floorboard of the car. While the latter aspect lent some support to SSSgt Tay’s observation on the location of the Bundles, I do not consider Mr Khairul’s evidence reliable. Proceeding on the basis that Mr Khairul had delivered the Bundles to the accused, the Bundles could well have been inside or outside the orange plastic bag when placed in the car. At the end of the day, there is nothing to contradict SSSgt Tay’s evidence that he found the Bundles beside the orange plastic bag on the floorboard of the car. There is also nothing to support the accused’s assertion that the Bundles were inside the orange plastic bag all the while.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As stated at [10] above, in the GD, I found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the drugs for reasons which fell into three broad areas. Mr Khairul’s evidence has no bearing on my finding within the third broad area that the Bundles were located outside the orange plastic bag. It has no bearing on my observation that “the round and irregular shape should have aroused suspicion that they contained something else besides cartons of cigarettes”: see [36] of the GD.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Accordingly, Mr Khairul’s evidence has no effect on my earlier verdict.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ramesh Chandr Tiwary (Ramesh Tiwary) for the accused;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anandan Bala, Theong Li Han and Claire Poh (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
