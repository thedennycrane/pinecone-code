        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Two appeals from the Valuation Review Board
                    (“the Board”) came before me. The appellant, CDL Properties Ltd
                    (“CDL” or “the Appellant”), is the owner of the
                    development known as Republic Plaza (“RP”). The appeals are over
                    the annual values and the effective dates on which property tax was charged. The
                    issues were raised before the Board in two sets of appeals, Valuation Review
                    Board Appeal Nos. 54–168 of 2008 (“Appeal
                    Nos. 54–168”) and Valuation Review Board Appeal
                    Nos. 172–173 of 2008 (“Appeal
                    Nos. 172–173”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal Nos. 54–168</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These appeals relate to 115 units in RP. Between
                    6 June and 8 June 2007 the Chief Assessor issued notices under
                    s 20(1) of the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 2005 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”), proposing to increase the annual value for the units
                    from about $4.20 psf/mth to $11 psf/mth with effect from 1 January
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal Nos. 172–173</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       These appeals relate to two units in RP which
                    were subdivided from one of the 115 units in Appeal Nos. 54–168 on
                    16 June 2007. Following the subdivision, the Chief Assessor issued notices
                    under s 20(1) of the Act and proposed to increase the annual value for
                    these units to $11 psf/mth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeals to the Board</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       CDL appealed to the Board against both
                    proposals. In the appeals, CDL argued that the annual value should be $7 psf/mth
                    with effect from 1 January 2007 for the 115 units and $9.80 psf/mth for the
                    two units from 16 June 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Board’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appeals were heard by the Board on
                    14 April 2009. The Board allowed Appeal Nos. 54–168 in part, and
                    ordered the annual value for the 115 units be set at $7 psf/mth as at
                    1 January 2007, and be raised to $11 psf/mth with effect from the dates on
                    which the Chief Assessor’s notices were issued (the “Notice
                    Dates”). The Board decided not to award costs for this set of appeals as
                    CDL had failed in its argument that the annual value for the whole of the year
                    2007 should be fixed from 1 January 2007 at $7 psf/mth and had succeeded
                    into having the increased annual values deferred to the Notice Dates. The Board
                    explained that it did not award interest on the refund of the excess tax paid on
                    the 115 units because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Appellants could have asked the Board to exercise its discretion
                        to award interest. As they did not do so, the Board was not able to hear
                        arguments from both sides on the issue and therefore, there was no order
                        made as to the award of interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other set of appeals, Appeal Nos. 172–173 was dismissed
                    with no order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       CDL appealed against the Board’s decisions
                    in the two sets of appeals on the grounds that the Board had erred in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_i"></a>(i)     ordering that the annual values for
                        the 115 units be amended to $11 psf/mth with effect from the Notice
                        Dates;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     dismissing CDL’s appeal that the annual value for the two units be
                        set at $9.80 psf/mth with effect from 16 June 2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     not ordering interest to be paid on
                        the refund of the property tax paid for the 115 units;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     not ordering
                        costs in favour of CDL in Appeal Nos. 54–168.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and in the appeal before me, CDL put forward a host of arguments which I have
                    taken the liberty to re-organise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(i)   The Board has no power to amend the annual values of the 115
                with effect from the Notice Dates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This submission was made in the context of the
                    Appellant’s presentation of the “General Scheme of the Act”.
                    It argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45.    ... [T]he Act generally envisages that property
                            tax is paid annually in advance based on the Valuation List prepared by
                            the Chief Assessor for the year. However, in some circumstances where
                            there is a specified change in respect of a property in the year, the
                            Comptroller of Property Tax may collect any property tax that is
                            underpaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46.    In other words, it is implicit that the Valuation
                            Lit for each year is valid for the entire year and any general change in
                            market rents (i.e. not a specified change in respect of a specific
                            property) over the course of the year should be reflected in the
                            Valuation List for the next year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant relied on s 6(1) and (2)(a)
                    of the Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6(1) As from 1st January 1961, a property tax shall, subject to the
                        provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or rates specified in this
                        Act for each year upon the annual value of all houses, buildings, lands and
                        tenements whatsoever included in the Valuation List and amended from time to
                        time in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The tax shall be payable by the owner of such property
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in the case of tax payable under subsection (1), yearly in advance
                            without demand, in the month of January;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but s 6(2)(a) should be read with
                    s 6(2)(b):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) without prejudice to paragraph (<em>a</em>),
                        where the Comptroller has served a notice for payment of the tax under this
                        Act, within one month of the service of that notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Giving the provision a proper construction, the
                    Valuation List must refer to a Valuation List in operation. When a Valuation
                    List is amended, the Valuation List is the amended Valuation List.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Reverting to the facts of the appeal, the
                    Chief Assessor had amended the Valuation List so that the annual value was to be
                    fixed at $11 psf/mth with effect from 1 January 2007. When the appeal
                    against the amendments went before the Board, the Board ruled that the annual
                    value should be fixed at $7 psf/mth up to the Notice Dates, and that the annual
                    value was to be increased to $11 psf/mth with effect from the Notice
                    Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Board derived its power to amend a
                    Valuation List from s 33(1)(a) and (b) of the Act which state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33. – (1) The Board, after hearing an appeal, may
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in the case of an appeal made under section 20A, dismiss the
                            appeal or direct that such amendments <em>as it thinks
                                proper</em> shall be made to the Valuation List for the year
                            in respect of which the appeal was made and for the ensuing years;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in the case of an appeal made under section 22, confirm, vary or
                            rescind the proposal of the Comptroller.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There are no restrictions laid down on the
                    amendments that the Board could make to the Valuation List. The Board can amend
                    the Valuation List “as it thinks proper”, and if the Board decides
                    on the facts before it that it thinks proper that a proposed increment of the
                    annual value should take effect from the date of the Chief Assessor’s
                    notice rather than the beginning of the year, the Board has the power to amend
                    the Valuation List accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Section 6(1) and (2) do not limit the
                    breadth of s 33(1). Under s 6(2)(a) the property tax for any year is
                    payable in advance in January. CDL had paid property tax for the 115 units in
                    advance, based on the rate in the Valuation List prevailing at the time of
                    payment. While CDL had fulfilled its property tax obligations when it made
                    payment, that does not mean that the payment will not be adjusted if the
                    Valuation List is amended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After the property tax on a property has been
                    paid, the Chief Assessor or the Board may decide that the annual value of the
                    property has changed upwards or downwards with effect from a specific date, and
                    amend the Valuation List to reflect the change. In the case of the 115 units the
                    Board had a reason for setting the commencement date for the $11 psf/mth annual
                    value to the Notice Dates. In its Grounds of Decisions, it explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Restricting the
                            survey to rental evidence around the period 1 January 2007 to June
                            2007, the Board was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to
                            indicate that rentals had risen to $11 psf/mth by the end of the second
                            quarter of 2007 (i.e. around the date of the Notices):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.1   Leases in Republic Plaza contracted between
                                May and July 2007 ranged between $10.50 psf/mth and $12.80 psf/mth.
                                The lease at $12.80 psf/mth was a 2-year lease while the lease at
                                $10.50 psf/mth was a 3-year lease. The rental evidence for 2007
                                shows that rents for 2-year leases were on average higher than rents
                                for 3-year leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.2   The table of Average Grade A Office (Gross)
                                rentals for 2007 compiled by the Respondents indicates that average
                                rents for 2Q07 ranged between $11.00-$14.50 psf/mth and for 4Q06 (a
                                proxy for 1 January 2007) ranged between $8.74 to $9.10
                                psf/mth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    On the other hand, the same materials that the
                            Chief Assessor relied on to show that rentals had risen to $11 psf/mth
                            by 2Q07 also show that on 1 January 2007, net rentals were
                            significantly lower than $11 psf/mth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.    The Board was therefore of the view that for VRB
                            54 to 168 of 2008, the Annual Value should be set at $7 psf/mth with
                            effect from 1 January 2007 and $11 psf/mth with effect from the
                            date of the Notice which would be in most cases 8 June 2007. Therefore,
                            the Board directed that the Valuation List be amended
                            accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Changes in the annual value are factual
                    matters, which do not necessarily take effect at the beginning of the year. If
                    the annual value is found to have increased, say with effect from the first day
                    of July, there is no reason why additional tax should not be paid for the second
                    half of the year just because the tax for the whole year computed on the
                    original annual value has been paid at the beginning of the year. For the same
                    reason, if the annual value is reduced with effect from 1 July, the excess
                    tax paid at the beginning of the year should be refunded to the taxpayer.
                    Section 6(1) and (2) should not be construed to mean that when property tax
                    has become payable, the tax cannot be adjusted even when the Valuation List is
                    amended. Such a construction would defeat the purpose of the amendment for the
                    first year when there is no reason for not giving immediate effect to the
                    amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(ii)   The valuation adopted by the Board was wrong, and the Board
                should have preferred the rental evidence from longer-term leases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Board referred to the evidence on the
                    rents and leases which were presented before it, and had stated in its Grounds
                    of Decision that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.1  Leases in Republic Plaza contracted between May
                            and July 2007 ranged between $10.50 psf/mth and $12.80 psf/mth. The
                            lease at $12.80 psf/mth was a 2-year lease while the lease at $10.50
                            psf/mth was a 3-year lease. The rental evidence for 2007 shows that
                            rents for 2-year leases were on average higher than rents for 3-year
                            leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.2  The table of Average Grade A Office (Gross)
                            rentals for 2007 compiled by the Respondents indicates that average
                            rents for 2Q07 ranged between $11.00-$14.50 psf/mth and for 4Q06 (a
                            proxy for 1 January 2007) ranged between $8.74 to $9.10
                            psf/mth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Appellant made an issue over this part of
                    the Grounds of Decision and argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The VRB erred in law in not preferring the rental evidence from
                        longer-term leases of units in Republic Plaza.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant supported the argument by
                    pointing out that the definition of “annual value” in s 2 of
                    the Act is the gross amount which “can reasonably be expected from year
                    to year”, and submitted that the phrase “from year to year”
                    implied “a continuous period of rental for an indefinite time and that is
                    more consistent with a longer-term lease”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellant cited Lord Esther MR in <em>R v South Straffordshire
                        Waterworks Co</em> (1885) 16 QBD 359 where he said at
                    370:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A tenant from year to year is not a tenant for one, two, three or four
                        years, but he is to be considered as a tenant capable of enjoying the
                        property for an indefinite time, having a tenancy which it is expected will
                        continue for more than a year, but which is liable to be put to an end to by
                        notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same vein, Lord Denning MR had stated that in determining rent
                    from year to year, the lease period to be used should be:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he period not too short nor yet too long, simply from year to
                        year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>– R v Paddington Valuation Officer ex parte
                        Peachy Property Corporation Limited</em> [1966] 1 QB 380, at
                    412.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In its Grounds of Decision, the Board had
                    observed that rents under three-year leases are generally lower than rents under
                    shorter leases, and the Appellant did not dispute the validity of the
                    observation. But the Board did not hold that short-term rents are to be given
                    more weight than long-term rents. It did not disregard the $10.50 rent for the
                    three-year lease, and it also took into consideration the $12.80 rent for a
                    two-year lease as well as the rents set out in the Table of Average Grade A
                    Office Rentals for 2007 before it arrived at the rent of $11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellant had not shown that the Board had
                    restricted itself to shorter-term lease rents and had ignored longer-term lease
                    rents, or had preferred the former to the latter. It was not suggested that
                    evidence on rents set “simply from year to year” or “for an
                    indefinite time” or for terms beyond three-years had been placed before
                    the Board. My understanding of prevailing rental practice in Singapore is that
                    it is unlikely that any of the 115 units or any comparable property are rented
                    out “from year to year” or “for an indefinite time”.
                    The Appellant had read too much into the observation that rents for two-year
                    leases are generally higher rents for three-year leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(iii)   The Board had relied on inadmissible and unreliable
                evidence in setting the annual value at $11 psf/m</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellant objected to the Board’s
                    reference to the Table of Average Grade A Office Rental for 2007 (“the
                    Table”). The Appellant submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he table of Average Grade A Office (Gross) rentals was compiled by the
                        Chief Assessor using extracts from various market reports of major property
                        consultancy firms. There is no further information on how these figures were
                        obtained and the properties from which these figures were complied. The
                        evidence is completely unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Chief Assessor had referred to the Table
                    in its submissions to the Board and had noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The average monthly gross rental for Grade A office in Raffles Place range
                        from $8.61 to $9.10 psf pm in the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of
                        2007. This rose to $16.56 to $17.15 psf pm by the
                            4<sup>th</sup> quarter of 2007. The annual increase
                        ranges from 82% to 96.5%. See Appendix III for details extracted from the
                        various market reports of major property consultancy firms. They show a
                        common consensus that office rental has increased significantly in
                            2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>

                    Table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Table was brought into the proceedings
                    before the Board for the first time in the Respondents’ Written
                    Submissions dated 21 November 2008 after both sides had presented its
                    evidence and witnesses before the Board. It was not part of the evidence of Yeo
                    Peng Khoon, a valuer of the Property Tax Division who gave evidence on behalf of
                    the respondents before the Board. The Appellant could have objected the
                    introduction of the Table in the closing submissions. It had the opportunity to
                    do that when it filed its further submissions on 5 December
                        2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>, but it did not object to
                    the Table or seek clarification on it. It raised no questions over the
                    admissibility or reliability of the Table in its submissions, and even during
                    the appeal before me, it did nothing to substantiate the assertion that the
                    Table was unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(iv)   The Board did not award interest to the Appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In its submissions the Appellant accused the
                    Board of having <em>refused</em> to exercise its discretion
                    to award interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This was an unjustified criticism against
                    the Board which had explained its decision for not exercising its discretion to
                    award interests (see para 5 hereof). In the light of the explanation,
                    nothing more needs to be said, except that the complaint reflected unfavourably
                    on the Appellant and its solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(v)   The Board did not award costs to the Appellant in Appeal
                Nos. 54 to 168</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Costs, as the Appellant acknowledged, may be
                    awarded at the discretion of the Board. The Board had exercised its discretion,
                    and in my view, exercised it reasonably. While the Appellant would prefer a more
                    favourable decision on the issue, it had no basis for alleging that the Board
                    had erred in the exercise of its discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
