</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 The medical profession is held in high esteem because its members have been called to the work of healing. Those who avail of the services of medical professionals must repose trust and confidence in them. This is essential, not least because it is necessary to enable a frank and open exchange of information. But this engenders an expectation on the part of patients that they will be treated with dignity and respect, and that any information they provide will be used for proper purposes. It is true that doctors have a life outside their profession. In general, they are not to be punished for moral failings in their personal lives. But what happens when the line between a doctor’s personal and professional life is obscured? That is the question presented in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The medical practitioners in question are Dr Ong Kian Peng Julian (“Dr Ong”) and Dr Chan Herng Nieng (“Dr Chan”). Dr Ong was a consultant general and colorectal surgeon in private practice and Dr Chan was a senior consultant in the Department of Psychiatry at the Singapore General Hospital at the time the subject matter of the disciplinary proceedings transpired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Dr Ong and Dr Chan each claimed trial to a single charge of improper conduct which brought disrepute to the medical profession under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “MRA”), and were convicted by a Disciplinary Tribunal (the “DT”) on their respective proceeded charges at the conclusion of a four-day hearing. The DT imposed a term of suspension of eight months on Dr Ong and a term of suspension of five months on Dr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 By Originating Summonses Nos 3 and 4 of 2022, Dr Ong and Dr Chan appeal against their convictions and sentences. By Originating Summonses Nos 5 and 6 of 2022, the Singapore Medical Council (the “SMC”) appeals against the sentences meted out by the DT, on the basis that each is manifestly inadequate. Before we turn to the merits of these appeals, we first set out the relevant factual background.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Dr Chan entered into an intimate relationship with one Serene Tiong (“Ms Tiong”) between 2017 and 2018. Sometime in 2018 Ms Tiong discovered that Dr Chan was contemporaneously involved in other intimate relationships and having sexual relations with other women. Ms Tiong then accessed Dr Chan’s phone, and without his knowledge and consent, took images of various WhatsApp messages exchanged between Dr Ong and Dr Chan. Ms Tiong then filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) against Dr Chan and Dr Ong with the SMC, appending the aforementioned images. The Complaint contained multiple allegations against Dr Ong and Dr Chan and the accompanying images showed parts of various conversations between Dr Ong and Dr Chan. After the initial review of the Complaint and the accompanying materials, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against Dr Ong and Dr Chan in respect of one particular exchange of messages in which Dr Ong had forwarded the contact information of one of his patients (“K”) to Dr Chan (the “Messages”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 K was a property agent who consulted Dr Ong on 19 March 2018. She underwent a medical procedure performed by him on 19 March 2018. She was discharged on 20 March 2018. Sometime between 19 and 20 March 2018, Dr Ong obtained K’s consent to share her contact details with Dr Chan, on the supposed basis that Dr Chan was looking to purchase a property. Shortly after, a WhatsApp conversation ensued between Dr Ong and Dr Chan, in the course of which Dr Ong forwarded K’s contact to Dr Chan. That conversation, which consisted of nine messages and spanned two minutes, was the subject of the proceeded charges against both Dr Ong and Dr Chan. For the purposes of this judgment, the individual messages have been transcribed and numbered as follows: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Message No.</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sender/Recipient</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Message</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Chan to Dr Ong</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">U r just too stretched .. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Chan to Dr Ong</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Can ask her for drinks instead ?</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Ong to Dr Chan</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">[sends the contact details for K]</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">4</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Ong to Dr Chan</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Feel free to play your game</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Ong to Dr Chan</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sure [replying to “Can ask her for drinks instead ?”]</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Dr Chan to Dr Ong</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Me?

On 21 March 2018, K sent Dr Chan a list of properties to look at. However, Dr Chan and K did not stay in contact and did not meet each other. Sometime in June 2018, Dr Ong contacted K and sought and obtained a WhatsApp message from K, in which she stated that she had consented to Dr Ong forwarding her contact details to Dr Chan for the purposes of a property transaction and that she did not eventually meet Dr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The rest of the WhatsApp message exchanges that had been appended to the Complaint were not the subject of any charges (the “Remaining Messages”). However, they documented various conversations between Dr Ong and Dr Chan discussing various other sexual encounters they each had which did not concern K, and we return to consider their significance later in this judgment. A few examples of these conversations included:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An exchange of messages in which Dr Ong discusses the possibility of having group sex with Dr Chan;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An exchange of messages in which Dr Ong and Dr Chan discuss their history of having affairs with married women;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An exchange of messages in which Dr Ong and Dr Chan discuss exchanging contact information of women to engage in sexual relations with. In particular, Dr Ong pointed out that Dr Chan had not been referring women to him recently, to which Dr Chan replied that he would “try”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The DT’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The hearing before the DT took place over four days. K was the only witness called by SMC. At the close of the SMC’s case, both Dr Chan and Dr Ong submitted that they had no case to answer. However, the DT agreed that the evidence adduced by SMC was adequate, and called for their defences against the respective proceeded charges. Both Dr Chan and Dr Ong testified in their own defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The DT convicted both Dr Ong and Dr Chan of improper acts or conduct which brought disrepute to the medical profession under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MRA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision regarding Dr Ong </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Dr Ong did not deny that he had forwarded K’s phone number to Dr Chan. However, he denied that he did so for the purpose of allowing Dr Chan to attempt to engage in sexual activity with K. He contended that he had obtained K’s consent to provide Dr Chan with her contact information because Dr Chan was looking to invest in property, and he wanted to refer Dr Chan as a prospective client for K. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The DT noted that Dr Chan had never asked him to introduce a property agent and found it especially peculiar in this light that the only property agent Dr Ong had introduced to Dr Chan was his patient, K, whom he barely knew, even though he claimed to know other property agents. In the circumstances, the DT declined to accept Dr Ong’s claim that he had introduced K to Dr Chan in connection with the latter’s supposed interest in investing in property (GD at [46]–[47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The DT then considered whether the Messages revealed that Dr Ong and Dr Chan were acting in collusion, and both knew that the purpose for which K’s contact particulars had been sent to Dr Chan was to enable him to attempt to have a sexual encounter with K and found this to be the case. It noted, among other things, that Message No. 7 which had been sent by Dr Ong carried an overt sexual connotation, and read together with the earlier messages as well as Dr Ong’s testimony at trial that there was no medical reason for him to perform anal dilation on K, the proper inference to be drawn was that Dr Ong was alluding to sexual activity of some kind, placing it beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr Ong and Dr Chan were discussing K in sexual terms (GD at [95]–[97], [99]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As for Messages Nos. 8 and 9, the DT found that these showed that Dr Ong and Dr Chan shared the common intention of having Dr Chan ask K out socially with a view to then attempting to have sexual relations with her (GD at [104]). In the DT’s view, the irresistible inference to be drawn from Dr Ong’s and Dr Chan’s conduct, the Messages, and the Follow-on Conversation was that both Dr Ong and Dr Chan had colluded to introduce K to Dr Chan with Dr Chan pretending to be a genuine property purchaser, when the real intention was for Dr Chan to get to know K socially and then attempt to engage in sexual activity with her (GD at [128]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 While the DT did not consider the Remaining Messages in coming to their findings on collusion and the sexual intent, the DT did find that the tenor of the Remaining Messages was consistent with them (GD at [148]). In particular, the DT was of the view that the Remaining Messages demonstrated that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had a “continuing intention” to introduce women who might be willing sexual partners to each other (GD at [152]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The DT held that in these circumstances, Dr Ong had failed to treat his patient (meaning K) with due courtesy, consideration, and respect (GD at [156]–[161], [168]–[170]). This was a breach of Guideline C1 of the SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (2016 Edition) (the “ECEG”), which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">C1. Attitude towards patients</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A good patient-doctor relationship requires doctors to display a high standard of professional conduct in their dealings and interactions with patients. This means:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) You must treat patients with courtesy, consideration, compassion and respect and without coercion, discrimination, harassment or exploitation. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) You must always respect patients’ right to privacy and dignity. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) You are not obliged to be subjected to abuse of any kind by patients or those with them. Yet, you must maintain a professional demeanour towards patients at all times. Except in cases of self-defence against physical harm, you must not retaliate but seek to end the engagement with the patients as quickly as possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The DT suspended Dr Ong for a term of eight months, having regard to the factors and sentencing framework set out by this court in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2019] 3 SLR 526 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span>”). In the DT’s view, the level of <span class="font-italic">harm</span> occasioned by Dr Ong’s abuse of the trust and confidence placed in him by K, for the potential sexual benefit of Dr Chan, was in the moderate range (GD at [225]–[233]). As Dr Ong had played a more active role in forwarding K’s contact to Dr Chan, and that this was a one-off incident, the DT concluded that his <span class="font-italic">culpability</span> was in the low to medium range (GD at [238]–[241]). Applying the analytical framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span>, the DT found the appropriate starting point within the applicable indicative sentencing range was suspension for a period of eight months (GD at [247]), and as the aggravating and mitigating factors did not have a material effect on the sentence no further adjustments were made (GD at [260]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision regarding Dr Chan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As for Dr Chan, the DT considered his evidence and noted that despite having his own “regular” property agent, Dr Chan saw fit to contact only K about his intention to purchase a second property. Having considered the content of the Messages in context, the DT concluded that Dr Chan had no genuine intention to explore the purchase of an investment property through K, and that Dr Chan and Dr Ong had colluded to use the pretext of a potential property investment as an excuse for Dr Chan to get to know K socially so that he could then attempt to engage in sexual activity with her (GD at [40]–[45], [47], [73], [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 However, the DT considered that Guideline C1 did not apply to Dr Chan because K was not his patient (GD at [166]). Notwithstanding this, the DT found that by his collusion with Dr Ong, Dr Chan was guilty of improper conduct that brought disrepute to the medical profession, an offence under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MRA. In the circumstances, the DT exercised its discretion to amend the charge against Dr Chan by removing the reference to Guideline C1 (GD at [181] and [188]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Applying an objective inquiry, the DT concluded that the collusive acts of Dr Ong and Dr Chan were something “that as medical practitioners they should not have done” (GD at [199]). Finding that Dr Chan’s conduct was improper and had brought disrepute to the profession, the DT convicted Dr Chan of the amended charge (GD at [202]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As to sentence, in the DT’s view, the level of harm occasioned by Dr Chan was pegged at the lower end of moderate given that K was not his patient, and because his offence had been committed in a non-professional capacity and so might cause less harm to public confidence (GD at [225(iv)(2)] and [234]). As Dr Chan had played a more passive role in receiving K’s contact with Dr Ong, the DT concluded that his culpability was in the low range (GD at [238]–[241]). In the circumstances, the DT found the appropriate starting point was suspension for a period of five months (GD at [259]), and as the aggravating and mitigating factors did not have a material effect on the sentence no further adjustments were made (GD at [260]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In this judgment, we consider the various appeals against both the convictions and sentences, and we set out the principal arguments raised by the parties in the relevant sections where we address each of the principal issues.

This is consistent with the fact that the ECEG itself states that it is not meant to be exhaustive, and as stated within the foreword to the ECEG “medical practitioners should endeavour to keep to the basic principles of the 2016 ECEG and extend their application to areas that may not be specifically addressed.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As we have said in <span class="font-italic">Low Chai Ling v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2013] 1 SLR 83 at [72] (cited in <span class="font-italic">Pang Ah San</span> at [43]), in order to determine what amounts to such misconduct, the court should make an objective inquiry into whether public confidence in the profession would be damaged by the revelation of their conduct, and what such conduct would signify to the public at large about doctors. This is an inquiry that is to be undertaken from the perspective of a reasonable layperson and no special deference is given to what other members of the profession might think about the conduct. This is so because the concern is with the standing of the profession in the estimation of others. Practically, such an inquiry would be aided by asking whether the reasonable person, on hearing about what the professional concerned had done, would have said without hesitation that he should not have done it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In this light, we turn to examine Dr Ong’s and Dr Chan’s appeals against their convictions, before considering whether their sentences were appropriate should their convictions be upheld. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were the charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The core factual circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged improper conduct are not in dispute. It was not disputed before the DT, nor before us, that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had exchanged the relevant messages. The real question turned on how the Messages were to be interpreted and what inferences this gave rise to. The substance of the charges against both Dr Ong and Dr Chan was that they had colluded with each other for Dr Ong to introduce a patient of his to Dr Chan so that Dr Chan could attempt to engage in sexual activity with her. SMC’s case rested primarily on the Messages and the legal burden was on SMC to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the proper interpretation of the Messages and the inference to be drawn therefrom was that the doctors had indeed colluded in the manner alleged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In these appeals, both Dr Ong and Dr Chan raised broadly similar arguments against their convictions, which essentially consisted of two prongs. First, it was contended by each of them that it could not be inferred from the Messages that they had colluded as alleged. It followed from this that the DT had erred in rejecting their case that Dr Ong had introduced K to Dr Chan for the purpose of possibly purchasing an investment property. Second, they contend that the Remaining Messages should not have been considered by the DT because they consisted of similar fact evidence that should not have been admitted in the circumstances. They contend that viewed in isolation, <span class="font-italic">without</span> reference to the Remaining Messages, there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both doctors had colluded as alleged.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What was the proper inference to be drawn from the Messages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 We begin with a preliminary point that was taken by counsel for Dr Ong, Mr N Sreenivasan SC. He argued that the reference to “her” in Message No. 2, which was sent by Dr Chan to Dr Ong and which read “[c]an ask her for drinks instead?”, did not necessarily refer to K. He contended that the Messages were a snapshot of part of a longer conversation between Dr Ong and Dr Chan and did not unambiguously point to the doctors colluding about anything sinister, much less something which concerned K specifically. Mr Sreenivasan pointed to the unavailability of the messages which preceded or came after the Messages to caution against coming to a definite conclusion about what was before us, given the danger that the messages that were exchanged before this and subsequently could cast the Messages in a different light. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We are not persuaded by Mr Sreenivasan’s arguments. First, by Dr Ong’s own evidence, it was he who had deleted the messages which preceded the Messages, in an attempt to avoid the scrutiny of his wife after Ms Tiong had contacted her over his indiscretions. Even if we accept that this was not done to avoid scrutiny in disciplinary proceedings, it does not assist either Dr Ong or Dr Chan. It is one thing to say that an adverse inference should not be drawn against Dr Ong for having deleted the messages; it is quite another to say that because the deleted messages could have been in his favour in the context of the disciplinary proceedings, we should assume they were and therefore find reasonable doubt as to the text of the Messages themselves. There is simply no basis to make that leap in favour of either Dr Ong or Dr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In our judgment, the proper interpretation of the Messages and the inferences that may be drawn from them must begin with the text of the Messages and the context in which that exchange took place. We turn therefore to the text of the Messages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Message No. 2 from Dr Chan reads “[c]an ask her for drinks instead?”. In direct reference to Message No. 2, Dr Ong replies “[s]ure” in Message No. 5. In reply, Dr Chan sends Message No. 6 which reads “[m]e? Out of the blue ask her?”. In our judgment, Messages Nos. 2, 5, and 6 clearly show that Dr Chan was entertaining the idea of asking a woman out for drinks upon Dr Ong’s suggestion. But once this is considered in light of the fact that Dr Ong had forwarded K’s contact information to Dr Chan in Message No. 3, and in light of Message Nos. 8 and 9 which referred to the “property” and “the property route”, it is simply impossible to arrive at any conclusion other than that Dr Chan was entertaining the idea of asking K out for drinks and that Message No. 2 was a reference to K. As we have already observed, K is a property agent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Message No. 8 which reads “[s]he’s expecting you re the property” was sent by Dr Ong in direct response to Message No. 6 and Dr Chan’s reply to this in Message No. 9 was: “I can’t decide to go thru [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the property route”. As we have said, when this is all seen together, one is led to the logical and inexorable conclusion from the plain text of the Messages that Dr Ong and Dr Chan were discussing how Dr Chan was to approach K to invite her for drinks, with the potential purchase of property being the possible way for Dr Chan to initiate the invitation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Turning next to the context in which the entire exchange was conducted, we identify a number of points which can reasonably be inferred from the messages. First, the material part started with Dr Chan asking Dr Ong if he could ask K out for drinks. This was not what one could characterise as a typical way in which to approach a property agent. Second, as the DT had rightly observed, it was difficult to understand why Dr Chan seemed hesitant and apprehensive about <span class="font-italic">how</span> to contact K if the conversation was genuinely just about a possible property purchase. To be clear, Message No. 2 shows that there was no hesitancy on the part of Dr Chan in wanting to meet K. Rather, it was a hesistancy over the <span class="font-italic">method</span> by which he was to secure a physical meeting with her. It is common knowledge that property agents advertise their services publicly, and expect to be contacted by total strangers interested in purchasing property. If the Messages had truly been about a genuine property transaction, it would have been entirely normal and natural for the meeting with K to take place such that there would have been no occasion at all for Dr Chan to have had any concern at all in this regard. Simply put, it was inexplicable that Dr Ong and Dr Chan felt the need to strategise, as it were, as to how the latter could meet up with K. Third, if the conversation between Dr Ong and Dr Chan had genuinely been one about property, it would not have been necessary for Dr Ong to tell Dr Chan that K was expecting him to contact her about “the property”. What else would it have been about? And it makes no sense for Dr Chan to then respond that he could not decide to go through the “property route”. This strikes us as remarkable for two reasons. First, the use of “property” as a “route”, makes it difficult to accept that the actual subject matter of the Messages was actually about property. And second, the suggestion in the final message that Dr Chan could not decide to go down the “property route”, points clearly to the idea that the real point of contacting K was <span class="font-italic">not</span> to pursue a property investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Fourth, when the Messages are examined in the light of what was perhaps the most troubling part of the entire exchange, which was the Message No. 7 that Dr Ong had sent to Dr Chan, whatever doubts one might have entertained about what Dr Ong and Dr Chan were discussing are completely erased. Read in an integrated and contextual manner, there was simply no reasonable way in which the explanation put forward by Dr Ong and Dr Chan—that their conversation was about the innocuous introduction of a property agent—could cohere with what was said in that message. Mr Sreenivasan does not deny that this message concerned K since it alluded to the medical procedure she had undergone with Dr Ong. However, Dr Ong sought to distance himself from the message by describing it as “an improper and crude joke made in a private [conversation] between two friends”, rather than a phrase that carried a sexual innuendo or connotation. Counsel for Dr Chan, Mr Lee Eng Beng SC, took the position before the DT and before us that Dr Chan had been a passive recipient of this message from Dr Ong, and he did not know why Dr Ong had sent that message; nor did he acknowledge it in his reply to Dr Ong. In our judgment, all these arguments are misconceived. Even if it could be reasonably argued that the message read in <span class="font-italic">isolation</span> was nothing more than an appalling joke made by a doctor about and at the expense of his patient, when seen in light of the entirety of the exchange that Message No. 7 was a part of, it becomes inescapable that the subject-matter of the Messages was not about property but about a potential sexual venture. As for Dr Chan’s submission that he had been a passive recipient of that message, this may be so, except that it entirely misses or sidesteps its real significance, which is that it demolishes the contention that this was nothing more than an innocent conversation about property. Indeed, if property is what the conversation concerned, then it is notable that Dr Chan did not react adversely to the crude remark made by Dr Ong, which would have been wholly out of place in the context of such a conversation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This interpretation of the Messages, which is that it had nothing really to do with any genuine interest in a property investment, and the inference that taken as a whole, this was a conversation in which Dr Ong was sharing his patient’s particulars with Dr Chan to enable the latter to attempt to have a sexual encounter with her is further strengthened when we consider the surrounding conduct of Dr Ong and Dr Chan. In the course of the proceedings below, it emerged that  Dr Chan was already in contact with another property agent, who handled the rental of another property he owned. This was a property agent whom Dr Chan said he was sufficiently familiar and comfortable with to even ask her to introduce women to him who would be open to having sexual relations with him. Yet he admitted that he never asked that property agent about the property he was purportedly interested in investing in. Indeed, it does not appear that Dr Chan had approached any other property agents at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As for Dr Ong, he admitted that Dr Chan had never asked him to help find a property agent. This was also confirmed by Dr Chan, who also had his own property agent whom he was familiar with, and it makes it even more implausible that a conversation that started with Dr Chan asking if he could “ask her for drinks instead?” could suddenly change track and become a discussion about a property investment in respect of which Dr Chan had never requested Dr Ong for help. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We also place little weight on the argument which was raised by both Mr Sreenivasan and Mr Lee that Dr Chan’s subsequent conduct in not following through to meet K, corroborated their case that the Messages were about a property transaction. First, the gravamen of the charges proceeded against both doctors was that they had colluded to refer K, who was Dr Ong’s patient, to Dr Chan for him to attempt to engage in sexual activity. In other words, it was the misuse of a patient’s contact information by Dr Ong with the participation of Dr Chan, that was at the heart of the charges. And as Mr Sreenivasan himself accepts, it was not necessary for Dr Chan to have met K or to have engaged in any sort of sexual activity with K, for the charges to be made out. Second, the fact that Dr Chan had subsequently contacted K about purchasing an investment property after he had received K’s contact information from Dr Ong does not shed any light on the Messages. After all, given that K had been told that Dr Chan would contact her <span class="font-italic">about a property</span>, it would have been most peculiar if he reached out to her in any other context. The point of the exercise was to conceal the real intent behind a façade of normalcy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We are therefore satisfied that Dr Ong had set up an introduction for K to be contacted by Dr Chan under the pretext of the latter’s feigned interest in a potential property transaction, when both he and Dr Chan knew that this was not the real point of the introduction. Rather, it was to enable Chan to pursue his own agenda, which they both knew was for him to try to have sex with K. We therefore agree with and affirm the DT’s finding to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Remaining Messages were inadmissible</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 We turn to consider, whether the Remaining Messages constituted inadmissible similar fact evidence. To recapitulate, as summarised at [8] above, the Remaining Messages consisted of several WhatsApp message exchanges which had taken place between Dr Ong and Dr Chan, discussing their sexual escapades as well as the exchange of contact information of women in order for either Dr Ong or Dr Chan to attempt to engage in sexual relations with them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee</span>”) at [41], the underlying rationale for the rule excluding similar fact evidence is to guard against reasoning by propensity. The rule exists to prevent the inference that a person’s past conduct increases his disposition or tendency to have committed the offence with which he is now charged (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Abdul Hadi bin </span><span class="font-italic">Haron v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 537 (“<span class="font-italic">Hadi</span>”) at [53]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 However, there is no blanket rule against the admission of similar fact evidence. Sections 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“EA”) provide that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">14.</span> <span class="font-italic">Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge,</span> good faith, negligence, rashness, ill will or goodwill towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, <span class="font-italic">are relevant when the existence of any such state of mind</span> or body or bodily feeling <span class="font-italic">is in issue or relevant</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15.</span>  When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional or done with a particular knowledge or intention, <span class="font-italic">the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In this regard, as stated by this court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee</span> at [48] and <span class="font-italic">Hadi</span> at [55], admission of similar fact evidence under ss 14 and 15 of the EA is permissible provided that it can be shown<span class="font-italic"> that the probative value of the evidence exceed</span><span class="font-italic">s its prejudicial effect.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Turning to the present case, we first address a preliminary argument put forward by both Dr Ong and Dr Chan. Both doctors rely on <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Constance </span><span class="font-italic">Margreat Paglar </span>[2021] 4 SLR 382 (“<span class="font-italic">LSS v Constance</span>”) at [42], where the Court of Three Judges stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is well established that disciplinary proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, and the rule that similar fact evidence is generally inadmissible in criminal proceedings lends further weight to the notion that antecedents are irrelevant for the purpose of determining liability in disciplinary proceedings…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">to contend that similar fact evidence is generally inadmissible in disciplinary proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In our judgment, <span class="font-italic">LSS v Constance</span> does not assist Dr Ong and Dr Chan. That case does not preclude or bar the admission of similar fact evidence in disciplinary proceedings. Rather, the court in<span class="font-italic"> LSS v Constance</span> was simply restating the general position that similar fact evidence is <span class="font-italic">generally</span> inadmissible. This was not inconsistent with the view in both <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hadi</span>, that similar fact evidence while generally inadmissible <span class="font-italic">can be admitted if its probative weight outweighs i</span><span class="font-italic">ts prejudicial effect</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 That said, we do not think that the issue of similar fact evidence is even engaged in the present case. It is clear that the DT had not considered the Remaining Messages as evidence pointing to propensity, but rather as evidence that demonstrated and shed light on the true context of the relationship between Dr Ong and Dr Chan, as well as their state of mind and intention when discussing K, in the light of which the Messages were to be construed (GD at [147]–[151]). As stated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee</span> at [37], in determining the admissibility of evidence, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is vital (see also <span class="font-italic">Michael Anak </span><span class="font-italic">Garing v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 748 at [8]). Like the DT, we do not think it necessary to rely on the Remaining Messages to reach the conclusion that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had colluded to refer K to Dr Chan with sexual intent. As explained in [31]–[39] above, the text of the Messages and the surrounding context in which they were exchanged was sufficient for us to come to a conclusion on their true meaning. In our view, the Remaining Messages were only of potential relevance in helping to establish the nature of the relationship between Dr Ong and Dr Chan so as to provide the context in which the Messages could be better understood, and this does nothing more than to confirm and fortify the conclusion we arrived at, based only on the text of the Messages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The EA allows the admission of such evidence under s 9, which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">9.</span> Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of any thing or person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened or which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant insofar as they are necessary for that purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the Remaining Messages are relevant and admissible for the <span class="font-italic">limited purpose</span> of demonstrating the nature of the relationship and dealings between Dr Ong and Dr Chan, which in turn was useful in shedding light on the meaning of the Messages. The nature and meaning of the Messages are without doubt relevant to the charges in question here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In any event, having considered the three factors of cogency, the strength of inference, and relevance, we are satisfied that the Remaining Messages were admissible, and their probative weight outweighed their prejudicial effect. First, the provenance of the Remaining Messages was not disputed. Neither Dr Ong nor Dr Chan disputes the authenticity of the Remaining Messages, or that they had sent those messages to each other. Their only contention in this regard was that Ms Tiong had curated the messages to paint them in the worst possible light. That does not change the fact that the Remaining Messages were in fact exchanged between Dr Chan and Dr Ong. Second, the inference that can be drawn from the Remaining Messages is clear. Neither Dr Ong nor Dr Chan disputes that the Remaining Messages showed that they had a history of introducing women to each other with a view to trying to engage in sexual activity and to discuss their sexual exploits and appetites. In this light, the Remaining Messages are not only relevant but also significant in contextualising what Dr Ong and Dr Chan were discussing in the Messages as well as demonstrating what they knew about each other, and their respective sexual exploits and appetites. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Remaining Messages are not pivotal to our analysis of the proper inference to be drawn from the Messages. We consider that there was sufficient evidence, even leaving aside the Remaining Messages, to show the real point of the Messages. But they help fortify our conclusion that Dr Ong and Dr Chan were not discussing a property transaction in relation to K in the Messages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether public confidence in the profession would be damaged by the conduct of Dr Ong and Dr Chan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In that light, we turn to consider if the charges are made out. We have held that the DT was correct to conclude from the Messages that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had colluded to introduce K to Dr Chan in order for Dr Chan to attempt to have sexual relations with K. Following from our observations at [25], the question is whether the DT erred in finding that public confidence in the medical profession would be damaged by the conduct of Dr Ong and Dr Chan. We approach this inquiry from the perspective of considering whether a reasonable person, on hearing about what Dr Ong and Dr Chan had done, would have said without hesitation that they should not have done it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Ong</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In our judgment, it is beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr Ong’s conduct in colluding with Dr Chan to refer K, who was his patient, to Dr Chan under a false pretence in order for Dr Chan to pursue his own agenda of trying to have sexual relations with her, was something a reasonable person would conclude that Dr Ong ought not to have done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, as we have noted, K was Dr Ong’s patient at the material time. The relationship between the doctor and his patient exists for the benefit and best interests of the patient (see <span class="font-italic">Pang Ah San v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2014] 1 SLR 1094 at [66]). The complexion of that relationship carries with it a very real potential for exploitation, which is precisely what Dr Ong had done for the potential benefit of Dr Chan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, Dr Ong obtained the consent of K to disclose her contact details to Dr Chan under false pretences. As stated in the text message K had sent Dr Ong on 22 June 2018 at his request: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hi Dr Ong, I have given my consent to you earlier on in Feb to give my contact to your friend to purchase a house. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In our judgment, any acquiescence on the part of K to have her contact details disclosed to Dr Chan was not valid consent given our finding that Dr Ong knew that Dr Chan had no intention to purchase a property. The fact that K’s contact information was publicly available is also immaterial. It is the manner in which that contact information had come to Dr Ong, the manner in which he had obtained the consent of K to give that information to Dr Chan for an ulterior motive, and the fact that he misrepresented to K that a friend of his would be in touch with her for a legitimate business purpose that make Dr Ong’s conduct objectionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Third, the Remaining Messages painted a clear picture of the attitudes of Dr Ong and Dr Chan and, what they knew about each other’s sexual exploits and appetites. Dr Ong was passing on his patient’s contact in betrayal of her trust, and with the knowledge that Dr Chan would try to convert that introduction into an opportunity to satisfy his own lustful appetite. Dr Ong certainly did not treat K with respect and dignity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In our judgment, Dr Ong’s conduct was incompatible with Guideline C1, which requires doctors to treat their patients with “courtesy, consideration… and respect … without exploitation”. Dr Ong does not dispute before us that if he were found guilty of collusion with Dr Chan, his conduct would be a breach of Guideline C1.  We also agree with the DT’s holding that ethical rules and guidelines have to be interpreted and read in a manner which gives effect to their underlying spirit and intent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Chan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning next to Dr Chan, in our judgment, it is also beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct of Dr Chan in colluding with Dr Ong, was something a reasonable person would conclude that Dr Chan ought not to have done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, it is not disputed by Dr Chan, that as a doctor, he knew the ethical rules that applied to him. He also acknowledged in both his witness statement and oral evidence before the DT that he knew that K was Dr Ong’s patient and that Dr Ong was passing K’s contact information to him. Dr Chan also knew all this <span class="font-italic">in the context of the type of relationship he and Dr Ong shared</span> as evidenced in the Remaining Messages. While we agree with the DT that Guideline C1 does not apply to Dr Chan since there was no doctor-patient relationship between him and K, it cannot be gainsaid that he had fully acquiesced and participated in a scheme where a fellow doctor was acting in violation of Guideline C1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, Mr Lee does not contend that the fact that K was not Dr Chan’s patient insulates him from culpability. This is rightly so, because a member of an honourable profession who receives information from another member of the profession which he knows was handed to him in breach of that other member’s duty, cannot be heard to say that he played no part in that breach where he intended to act on that information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 We therefore agree with the DT that Dr Chan’s conduct in receiving confidential patient information from another doctor in these circumstances and for these purposes, was conduct that a reasonable person would conclude he should not have engaged in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the circumstances, we find that the DT did not err in finding that both Dr Ong and Dr Chan, were guilty of improper conduct which brought disrepute to the medical profession. Accordingly, we uphold their convictions on the proceeded charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision on sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Before we consider the appropriate sentences in respect of both Dr Ong and Dr Chan, we observe that the parties do not dispute the applicability of the four-step sentencing framework we set out in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang </span>(the “<span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> framework”) even though we stated in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> that the framework was set out in relation to cases where deficiencies in a doctor’s clinical care caused harm to a patient, and would not be applicable to other types of misconduct which lie within or outside a doctor’s professional responsibilities even though the same considerations of harm and culpability might be relevant. This is because the relevant considerations and types of harm caused by the various forms of misconduct are markedly different and are often fact-specific (<span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> at [36]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]his sentencing matrix is only applicable to cases where deficiencies in a doctor’s clinical care causes harm to a patient, and not to other forms of medical misconduct such as overcharging, falsification of medical documents, inappropriate relations with a patient, or conduct which lies outside the ambit of a doctor’s professional responsibilities to his patient but which leads to a conviction for a criminal offence implying a defect of character that renders the doctor unsuitable for registration as a medical practitioner. <span class="font-italic">Although the considerations of harm and culpability may remain relevant, those cases are likely to involve considerations that are specific to the type of misconduct in question and which would not arise in cases relating to clinical care. Further, the types of harm caused by those forms of misconduct may be markedly different in nature to that which is caused by misconduct in the form of deficient clinical care, and it would therefore not be appropriate to assess those cases by reference to the same matrix.</span> Instead, the appropriate sentencing ranges for those types of matters should be considered by reference to other cases involving similar circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 On 15 July 2020, the Sentencing Guidelines Committee (the “Committee”) appointed by the SMC published the <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Guidelines for Singapore Medical Disciplinary Tribunals</span> (the “<span class="font-italic">Sentencing Guidelines</span>”), which extended the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> framework to both clinical and non-clinical offences. In particular, the Committee was of the view that the definition of “harm” in the <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> framework was broad enough to include other forms of harm, such as non-physical harm (including emotional or psychological distress), potential harm, and harm caused to public confidence in the medical profession, or to public health and safety or the public healthcare system.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We recognise the logic of the Committee’s suggestion that the <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> framework can and should be extended to other forms of misconduct, so as to guide the DT in sentencing. Having said that, we would emphasise the importance of bearing in mind the nuances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The four steps under the modified <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> framework are briefly summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Step 1: The first step is to evaluate the seriousness of the offence with reference to harm and the culpability of the doctor.

Second, he argues that the harm caused in the present case was lower than the harm identified in the closest analogous precedents of <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">ingapore Medical Council v Dr Deshan</span> [2020] SMCDT 6 (“<span class="font-italic">Deshan</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">ingapore Medical Council v Dr Azman bin Osman</span> [2020] SMCDT 7 (“<span class="font-italic">Azman</span>”), both of which concerned disciplinary action meted in respect of doctors who had committed sexual offences. Third, he argues that his culpability was low, as there was no pre-meditation, and he was only behaving casually or flippantly in providing K’s contact details to Dr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In SMC’s appeal against Dr Ong’s sentence, it argues that the term of suspension of eight months was manifestly inadequate<span class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase"> </span>First, SMC argues that Dr Ong’s level of culpability falls in the medium range, and that the DT had erred in failing to consider that Dr Ong’s conduct was premeditated and intentional. Second, SMC argues that a term of suspension of 12 months is consistent with the sentences that have been meted out in respect of sexual misconduct, citing cases from the UK as well as <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> the matter of Dr AAB</span> [2008] SMCDC 2 (“<span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span>”). Third, SMC argues that a higher sentence is warranted on the basis of general deterrence, and the need for a clear message to be sent to the medical profession that sexual exploitation of a patient, whether for one’s own benefit or for the benefit of another, is impermissible and reprehensible.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is clear that this is a case that involves significant harm to public confidence in the medical profession. What Dr Ong did was an abuse of the trust and confidence that a patient had reposed in him for the potential sexual benefit of Dr Chan. Further, it was not only disrespectful to K, but it also dehumanised her into an object for sexual gratification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 That no actual harm was caused to K by either Dr Ong or Dr Chan misses the point. Such an assertion is true only in the limited sense that she was not compelled to engage in sexual relations with Dr Chan under false pretences. But it cannot be denied that she suffered humiliation and indignity as a result of what Dr Ong and Dr Chan did to her, and the fact that she was Dr Ong’s patient made it all the more aggravating. If actual physical harm had been caused to K, the sanction called for would likely have been a striking out order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In our judgment, the harm to public confidence cannot be understated. Patients are entitled to expect that their doctors will display a high standard of professional conduct in their dealings and interactions with them. This extends to how their doctors handle their personal information and their details even after the end of their interactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 All things considered, we regard the harm caused in the present case to be on the higher end of the moderate range. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Culpability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Turning to Dr Ong’s culpability, we identify a number of points regarding Dr Ong’s conduct that bear emphasis. First, Dr Ong obtained K’s supposed consent under false pretences. Second, Dr Ong was the one who had initiated the act of collusion with Dr Chan, by forwarding K’s contact details to Dr Chan. Third, the actions of Dr Ong were callous and an intentional departure from the conduct reasonably expected of a medical practitioner. There is simply no possible justification for dealing with a patient’s information in the way Dr Ong dealt with K’s information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Having considered Dr Ong’s case, even if we accept that this was the only incident involving a patient, it is clear that his culpability was on the high end of the medium range. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable indicative sentencing range and appropriate starting point within that range</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having found that Dr Ong’s conduct was of a medium degree of culpability and resulted in moderate harm, the applicable indicative sentencing range is a term of suspension between one to two years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Following from our holdings in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang</span> and at [62] above that the appropriate sentence in each case turns on its facts, and that reference must be had to relevant cases involving similar circumstances, we make some observations on the cases cited by both Dr Ong and SMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, <span class="font-italic">Deshan</span> and <span class="font-italic">Azman</span> are both of little assistance because they involved respondent doctors who had pleaded guilty to very different acts. In <span class="font-italic">Deshan</span>, the respondent doctor had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MRA for recording upskirt videos of two females at a supermarket and was sentenced to a term of suspension of four months. In <span class="font-italic">Azman</span>, the respondent doctor had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MRA of outraging the modesty of a female passenger on a bus by exposing his undergarment and groin. Neither of these cases involved an interaction with a patient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the case of <span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span> cited by SMC, the factual circumstances of that case are distinguishable from the present case. <span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span> involved a doctor who engaged in a sexual relationship with a patient, which would arguably been of significantly more harm than the present case. In addition, the respondent doctor in <span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span> had been charged with three other offences involving the medical records of patients, which included the tampering of patient records and the improper disclosure of patient information to a third party. In contrast, while the intended purpose of Dr Ong’s conduct was to allow Dr Chan to engage in sexual relations with K, it is important to bear in mind that the gravamen of the charge in the present case was Dr Ong’s failure to accord K with courtesy, consideration, respect and without exploitation. That said, even considering the fact that the respondent doctor in <span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span> had chosen to plead guilty to the charges that were proceeded against him, we are of the view in any case that the suspension of two years meted out in that case was likely too lenient in light of the gravity of the offences involved, and do not consider this case a relevant precedent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As for the UK cases involving sexual misconduct committed by doctors which were cited by SMC, those cases are of limited value because they involve a different statutory regime for misconduct and also involve factual circumstances more similar to those found in <span class="font-italic">Dr AAB</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The circumstances surrounding Dr Ong’s misconduct are “novel” in that they involve an attempt by a doctor to procure a sexual benefit for another member of the profession. In the absence of useful sentencing precedents, we turn to consider the appropriate sentence with reference to the offence-specific factors. In our judgment, because of the medium degree of culpability and moderate harm which resulted from Dr Ong’s conduct, a lengthy period of suspension was warranted. In these circumstances, we find that the DT’s sentence of eight months’ suspension was manifestly inadequate and think the appropriate “starting point” in this case is a term of suspension of two years. We now turn to the final step in the analysis, which is to consider the effect of any relevant offender-specific mitigating or aggravating circumstances, if any. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevant mitigating and aggravating circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Dr Ong submitted in mitigation that he had an unblemished record as a medical practitioner, that he had a very low propensity for re-offending, that no sexual advances were eventually made on K, and that he had expressed remorse over the crude comment he had made about K.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Ang Peng </span><span class="font-italic">Tiam v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2017] 5 SLR 356 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Peng </span><span class="font-italic">Tiam</span>”) at [105], we accepted that an offender’s long and unblemished record may be regarded as a mitigating factor if it allows the court to infer that the offender had acted “out of character” and was unlikely to re-offend. However, we also observed that the mitigating value of a clean record may be displaced in the face of a need for general deterrence, and in light of the possible negative impact on public confidence in the medical profession where a senior and eminent member of the medical profession is convicted (<span class="font-italic">Ang Peng </span><span class="font-italic">Tiam</span> at [106]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the present case, we agree that no mitigating weight should be accorded to Dr Ong’s record for two reasons. First, this being a case that does not involve his clinical judgment or professional expertise, the weight of his unblemished record is of little relevance. Further, the fact that Dr Ong was a senior doctor of more than 20 years’ standing, amplifies the negative impact his misconduct would have had on public confidence in the medical profession. Second, and more importantly, we agree with the SMC that a key sentencing objective in the present case is that of general deterrence. It is imperative that a clear message be sent to the medical profession that such conduct is utterly unacceptable, and that harsh consequences will befall those who might be considering similar acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  A genuine sign of remorse might warrant a reduction in the sentence received by the offender. However, while Dr Ong has expressed remorse over the crude remark he made about K, his oral testimony paints a different picture of how he truly feels: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Dr Ong, it didn't occur to you then that you should, instead of deleting these messages, keep those messages so that you can explain yourself and show those messages within their full context?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: You know all the rest of the messages that have been exhibited by Serene Tiong. There's nothing there I want to -- to show my wife. There's nothing there I would like to show her. And that's the only thing that was on my head at that point in time. <span class="font-italic">I never considered SMC </span><span class="font-italic">getting involved. There was nothing sexual or any professional misconduct. And that's my stand to this day.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen from Dr Ong’s reply in cross-examination, he did not genuinely believe that what he did was “sexual or [involved] any professional misconduct”. In our view, Dr Ong’s claimed remorse had no mitigatory value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For these reasons, we are satisfied that the appropriate sentence in Dr Ong’s case is a term of suspension of two years. In our judgment, the relevant sentencing principle of general deterrence, as well as the need to protect public confidence and uphold the standing of the medical profession, justify the length of suspension we have imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dr Chan </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In Dr Chan’s appeal against his sentence, he argues that the DT erred in finding the harm occasioned by Dr Chan’s conduct was moderate because (a) public confidence in the medical profession would not be eroded; (b) no harm was caused to K; (c) there was no abuse of power in a doctor-patient relationship as K was not Dr Chan’s patient; and, (d) that the Messages were private and confidential communications.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The SMC argues that the term of suspension of five months was manifestly inadequate for the following reasons. First, the SMC argues that the DT erred in finding that Dr Chan’s conduct fell within the lower end of the moderate range. In particular, the fact that Dr Chan – who was a doctor himself – had facilitated Dr Ong’s abuse of the trust of a patient, would significantly harm public confidence in the medical profession.<span class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase"> </span>Second, SMC argues that Dr Chan’s level of culpability falls at the higher end of the low range, and that the DT had erred in similarly failing to consider that Dr Chan’s conduct was premeditated and intentional. Third, SMC argues that a term of suspension of nine months is consistent with the sentences that have been meted out in respect of sexual misconduct, citing the same cases and arguments it had raised in relation to Dr Ong’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our decision regarding Dr Chan’s sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The facts relating to Dr Chan’s conduct were largely similar to those for Dr Ong, save for a few material differences which we highlight here: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Dr Chan was the recipient of the contact information of K, and as such played a more “passive” role than Dr Ong (see [71] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) K was not Dr Chan’s patient, and he therefore did not have a doctor-patient relationship with K (see [56] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Notwithstanding these facts, Dr Chan’s role cannot be understated. He had colluded with Dr Ong despite knowing that K was Dr Ong’s patient. After having received the contact information of K, he proceeded to contact K, although he did not eventually follow through by meeting K or attempting to engage in sexual relations with her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Applying the same sentencing approach we adopted with regard to Dr Ong, we consider the harm that was caused to the public confidence in the medical profession to be significant. There can be no doubt that the public would regard with consternation the fact that one doctor had abetted another doctor’s abuse of the trust of a patient for his potential personal benefit. In the circumstances, we see no reason to find that the harm occasioned by Dr Chan should be lower than the harm occasioned by Dr Ong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As for Dr Chan’s culpability, we accept the fact that he had not actively sought the contact information of K, though he did then use it to contact her. That being said, Dr Chan admitted that he knew that K was Dr Ong’s patient at the time the Messages were exchanged, and following from our holding as to the proper interpretation of the Messages and inferences to be drawn from them, it would have been obvious to Dr Chan that Dr Ong would not have had the consent of K to share her contact information with Dr Chan <span class="font-italic">for the purpose</span> of his potential sexual gratification. Indeed, this was why they had to strategise how Dr Chan would initiate his contact with K. In the circumstances, we assess his culpability as “medium”. Taking these considerations into account, we find that the DT’s sentence of five months’ suspension was manifestly inadequate and that the term of suspension should be significantly longer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For the same reasons we have stated in respect of Dr Ong, no mitigatory weight should be placed on Dr Chan’s unblemished record, having considered Dr Chan’s seniority and the need for general deterrence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In these circumstances, we think that a sentence of 18 months’ suspension is appropriate for Dr Chan and is also compatible with the sentence imposed on Dr Ong having regard to the relative culpability of each doctor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As for Dr Chan’s argument that the DT erred in ordering him to bear the full costs and expenses of the disciplinary proceedings, we see no merit in this. While the proceeded charge against Dr Chan was amended to remove reference to Guideline C1, we agree with the SMC that Dr Chan’s defence was not prejudiced by the amendment and there is no reason for making a partial costs order against the SMC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For these reasons, we dismiss both the appeals of Dr Ong and Dr Chan in OS 3 and OS 4 respectively.

Both Dr Ong and Dr Chan were convicted on the proceeded charges and were sentenced to terms of suspension of eight months and five months, respectively. Originating Summonses Nos 3 and 4 of 2022 were the appeals of Dr Ong and Dr Chan against their respective convictions and sentences. Originating Summonses Nos 5 and 6 of 2022 were the appeals by the Singapore Medical Council (the “SMC”) against the sentences imposed on Dr Ong and Dr Chan respectively.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Dr Ong and Dr Chan were registered medical practitioners. Dr Ong was a consultant general and colorectal surgeon in private practice and Dr Chan was a senior consultant in the Department of Psychiatry at the Singapore General Hospital at the material time. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Dr Chan was in an intimate relationship with one Serene Tiong (“Ms Tiong”) between 2017 and 2018. Sometime during this relationship, Ms Tiong discovered that Dr Chan was involved in intimate relationships with other women. Ms Tiong then accessed Dr Chan’s phone and took images of various WhatsApp messages exchanged between Dr Ong and Dr Chan. Ms Tiong filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) against Dr Chan and Dr Ong with the SMC, attaching the aforementioned images. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against both Dr Ong and Dr Chan in respect of one of the WhatsApp message exchanges in which Dr Ong had forwarded the contact information of one of his patients (“K”) to Dr Chan (the “Messages”). The rest of the WhatsApp message exchanges appended to the Complaint documented various conversations between Dr Ong and Dr Chan discussing various other sexual encounters they each had which did not concern K (the “Remaining Messages”), but were not the subject of any charges.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 K was a property agent who had consulted Dr Ong on 19 March 2018 and had undergone a medical procedure performed by Dr Ong on the same day. It was during this time, that Dr Ong obtained K’s consent to share her contact details with Dr Chan, on the supposed basis that Dr Chan was looking to purchase a property. A WhatsApp conversation ensued between Dr Ong and Dr Chan, where Dr Ong sent Dr Chan K’s contact details and discussed how Dr Chan was to approach K (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Messages). The Messages comprised nine messages, spanning about two minutes.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The DT found that the proper interpretation to be made from the Messages was that Dr Ong had colluded with Dr Chan to introduce K to the latter so that Dr Chan could attempt to engage in sexual activity with her. Accordingly, the DT convicted both Dr Ong and Dr Chan on their respective proceeded charges, and sentenced Dr Ong to eight months’ suspension from practice, and Dr Chan to five months’ suspension from practice. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 In Dr Ong’s and Chan’s appeals against their convictions, they raised two arguments. First, what was the proper inference to be drawn from the Messages. Second, whether the Remaining Messages should not have been considered by the DT. As for the parties’ respective appeals against the sentences imposed, the issue was whether the DT had properly considered the relevant sentencing considerations in coming to its decision on the sentences. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 It is not necessary for an act or conduct of a medical practitioner to be in breach of a guideline under the SMC Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (2016 Edition) for that medical practitioner to be found guilty under s 53(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MRA. In determining what amounts to such misconduct, the court makes an objective inquiry into whether public confidence in the profession would be damaged by the revelation of their conduct, and what such conduct would signify to the public at large about doctors. This is an inquiry that is to be undertaken from the perspective of a reasonable layperson and no special deference is given to what other members of the profession might think about the conduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[24]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[25]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The interpretation of the Messages did not support the argument put forward by both Dr Ong and Dr Chan, that this was a conversation about a genuine property transaction. The proper interpretation and inferences to be drawn from the text of the Messages and the context in which the Messages arose, was that Dr Ong was sharing his patient’s particulars with Dr Chan to enable the latter to pursue his own agenda, which they both knew was for Dr Chan to try to have sex with K. Accordingly, the court agreed that the DT had correctly concluded from the Messages that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had colluded to introduce K to Dr Chan in order for Dr Chan to attempt to have sexual relations with K: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[31]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">[49]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The exclusion of similar fact evidence is to guard against reasoning by propensity. However, there is no blanket rule against the admission of similar fact evidence, which may be admissible under ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “EA”) where it can be shown that the probative value of the evidence exceeds its prejudicial effect: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[41]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 In determining the admissibility of evidence, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is vital. In the present case, the text of the Messages and the context in which they were exchanged was sufficient to show that Dr Ong and Dr Chan had colluded to refer K to Dr Chan with sexual intent. The Remaining Messages was only of potential relevance to establish the nature of the relationship between Dr Ong and Dr Chan so as to provide the context in which the Messages could be understood. Such evidence is admissible under s 9 of the EA and did not raise the issue of similar fact evidence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[45]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[46]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 In any event, having considered the cogency of the Remaining Messages, the strength of the inference to be drawn from them, and their relevance, it is also clear that the probative weight of the Remaining Messages outweighed their prejudicial effect: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[42]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[47]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The DT had not erred in finding that both Dr Ong and Dr Chan were guilty of improper conduct which brought disrepute to the medical profession. It was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr Ong’s conduct in colluding with Dr Chan to refer K, who was his patient, to Dr Chan to attempt to engage in sexual relations with her, was something a reasonable person would conclude that Dr Ong ought not to have done. It was also proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr Chan’s conduct in colluding with Dr Ong was something a reasonable person would conclude that Dr Chan ought not to have done: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[50]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Adopting the four-step sentencing framework set out by the court in <span class="font-italic">Wong Meng Hang v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2019] 3 SLR 526, the court was of the view that the appropriate order in respect of Dr Ong was a term of suspension of two years. Dr Ong’s conduct entailed significant harm to public confidence in the medical profession. Dr Ong’s actions were an abuse of the trust and confidence that a patient had reposed in him, and fell in the “moderate” range. Dr Ong’s misconduct was of a medium degree of culpability in that he had obtained K’s consent under false pretences, initiated the act of collusion with Dr Chan, and was an intentional departure from the conduct reasonably expected of a medical practitioner. Given the moderate harm which resulted from Dr Ong’s conduct and medium degree of culpability, the DT’s sentence of eight months’ suspension was manifestly inadequate. The applicable indicative sentencing range was a term of suspension between one to two years. Bearing in mind the need for general deterrence, Dr Ong’s seniority, his apparent lack of remorse, as well as the need to protect public confidence and uphold the standing of the medical profession, no mitigatory weight was placed on Dr Ong’s unblemished record: <span class="font-weight-bold">[67]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The court increased Dr Chan’s sentence to 18 months’ suspension from practice. Similar to Dr Ong’s case, the harm caused by Dr Chan’s conduct to the public confidence was significant and fell in the “moderate” category. While Dr Chan’s degree of culpability fell in the “medium category”, his culpability was not as serious as Dr Ong’s in that he did not actively seek the contact information of K. Given the moderate harm which resulted from Dr Chan’s conduct and medium degree of culpability, the DT’s sentence of five months’ suspension was manifestly inadequate. Taking into account the harm caused and the relative culpability of Dr Chan and Dr Ong, a lower overall sentence was imposed in respect of Dr Chan. For the same reasons as Dr Ong, no mitigatory weight was placed on Dr Chan’s unblemished record, having considered his seniority and the need for general deterrence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[86]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[91]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Both the appeals of Dr Ong and Dr Chan against their convictions and sentences in OS 3 and OS 4, respectively, were dismissed. The appeals of the SMC in OS 5 and OS 6 against the sentences imposed on Dr Ong and Dr Chan, respectively, were allowed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[93]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
