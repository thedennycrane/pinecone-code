<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       However good or bad in the eyes of a party, the
                    decision of an arbitral tribunal with the requisite jurisdiction is final and
                    binding. This general proposition of law is a manifestation of the fundamental
                    principle of <em>interest reipublicae ut sit finis
                        litium</em> or finality in proceedings. Arbitration will not survive,
                    much less flourish, if this core precept is not followed through by the courts.
                    The integrity and efficacy of arbitration as a parallel dispute resolution
                    system will be subverted if the courts appear unable or unwilling to restrain
                    themselves from entering into the merits of every arbitral decision that comes
                    before it. As is well-established under Singapore arbitration jurisprudence, the
                    power to intervene in arbitrations generally, and more specifically to set aside
                    awards, must and should only be exercised charily, in accordance with the rules
                    under the applicable arbitral framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Although parties have a right and expectation to
                    a fair arbitral process and the courts should give maximum effect to these
                    safeguards in deserving cases, parties must not be encouraged to dress up and
                    massage their unhappiness with the substantive outcome into an established
                    ground for challenging an award. Particularly for international commercial
                    arbitrations under the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“IAA”), it is imperative that an application to set aside an
                    award under s 24 read with Art 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law for International
                    Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“Model Law”) is not a guise for a
                    rehearing of the merits. Unfortunately, as this case exemplifies, sieving out
                    the genuine challenges from those which are effectively appeals on the merits is
                    not easy under the present law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Originating Summons No 178 of 2012 is an
                    application to set aside an arbitral award (“the Award”) made in
                    respect of two arbitrations which were consolidated (“the
                    Arbitration”). The Arbitration arose out of a dispute over the sale and
                    purchase of two second-hand vessels, namely, the “<em>The
                        Pacific 18</em>” and “<em>The Pacific
                        38</em>” (individually the “Vessel” and
                    collectively the “Vessels”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Memorandum of Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 24 September 2008, more than a month after
                    negotiations commenced, Grupo TMM SAB (“Grupo TMM”) entered into
                    two Memoranda of Agreement (“MOAs”) with Pacific Richfield Marine
                    Pte Ltd (“PRM”) for the purchase of the Vessels from PRM, one
                    Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) for each vessel. The MOAs were
                    signed after the Vessels’ classification records had been inspected
                    between 16 August 2008 and 20 August 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Each MOA was accompanied by, <em>inter alia</em>, two addenda, a specification describing the
                    capabilities of each Vessel (collectively “the Specifications”),
                    and a schematic diagram of each Vessel. Addendum No 2<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> provided that Grupo TMM
                    shall novate the MOA to its subsidiary, TMM Division Maritima SA de CV
                    (“TMM”). Thus, for all intents and purposes, TMM was the buyer and
                    PRM was the seller of the Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Addendum No 1, the more crucial of the two
                    addenda, stated that each Vessel shall be delivered with the repairs in the
                    attached spreadsheet completed and accomplished at PRM’s account and cost.
                    Essentially, the two spreadsheets (collectively “the
                    Spreadsheets”) contained the items in each Vessel which TMM wanted to be
                    repaired before delivery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    There were a total of 16 items in the spreadsheet for <em>The
                        Pacific 18</em>, and eight items for <em>The Pacific
                        38</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       One of the key repairs sought was the
                    restoration of the Vessels to Dynamic Positioning (DP) System 1 (DP-1) Class
                    notation and for the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) to
                    classify them with the DP-1 Class notation. This was listed as Item 1 on the
                    Spreadsheets. It is common ground that at the time the Vessels were inspected
                    prior to the signing of the MOAs, and at the time of entering into the MOAs, the
                    Vessels were neither equipped with a DP-1 system nor did their Class
                    certificates contain a DP-1 Class notation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       TMM paid US$5.15m, 10% of the purchase price of
                    the Vessels (“the Deposit”), into an escrow account with E S
                    Platou (Asia) Pte Ltd (“Platou”). The delivery date for the
                    Vessels was 7 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Notice of Readiness </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The clauses in the MOAs which are particularly
                    relevant to this dispute are cll 5(a), and 11. They provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Notices, time and place of delivery</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    The Sellers shall keep the Buyers well informed of
                            the Vessel’s itinerary and shall provide the Buyers with 05 days,
                            and 01 days notice of the delivery estimated time of arrival at the
                            intended place of drydocking/underwater inspection/delivery. When the
                            Vessel is at the place of delivery and in <b><em>every
                                respect physically ready for delivery</em></b> in accordance with
                            this Agreement, the Sellers shall give the Buyers a written Notice of
                            Readiness for delivery. Such Notice of Readiness shall only be given in
                            the period between the hours of 1800 hrs Mexican time on a Sunday and
                            1700 hrs Mexican time on a Wednesday during any such period that falls
                            within the delivery spread as stated in Line 60 herein.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Condition for delivery</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Vessel with everything belonging to her shall be at the Sellers’
                        risk and expense until she is delivered to the Buyers, but subject to the
                        terms and conditions of this Agreement she shall be <em>delivered and taken over as is where is, but as she was at the time of
                            inspection, fair wear and tear excepted</em>. However, the Vessel
                        shall be delivered physically ready with her class maintained without
                        condition/recommendation, free of average damage affecting the
                        Vessel’s class, and with her classification certificates valid for 3
                        months after delivery and national certificates, as well as all other
                        certificates the Vessel had at the time of inspection, valid and unextended
                        without condition/recommendation by Class or the relevant authorities at the
                        time of delivery. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Inspection” in this Clause 11, shall mean the Buyers’
                        inspection, according Clause 4 a) or 4 b), if applicable, or the
                        Buyers’ inspection prior to the signing of this Agreement. If the
                        Vessel is taken over without inspection, the date of this Agreement shall be
                        the relevant date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Thus, the issuance of a valid Notice of
                    Readiness for delivery of the Vessels (“NOR”) pursuant to cl 5(a)
                    of the MOAs is an important step in the transaction as it obliges the buyer to
                    take delivery of the Vessels. This in turn affects the date on which the buyer
                    is obliged to make payment of the balance purchase price, a matter governed by
                    cl 3 of the MOA which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The said deposit and the 90% balance of the Purchase Price shall be paid
                        in full free of bank charges to an account with the Seller’s nominated
                        bank on the date of closing and delivery of the Vessel and simultaneously
                        with the delivery of all closing / delivery documentation as mutually agreed
                        in this MOA, but not later than 36 hours <del>3
                            banking days</del> after the Vessel is in every respect physically
                        ready for delivery in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
                        Agreement and Notice of Readiness has been given in accordance with Clause
                        5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 28 October 2008 (Mexican Time), PRM issued
                    a NOR which reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On behalf of the Sellers, we hereby give you Notice of Delivery of the
                        vessels. The vessels presently ready for delivery at mile 20 offshore
                        Veracruz, Mexico in every respect ready for delivery. The present
                        coordinates of the vessel are as follows reported at 17:00 hours on
                            28<sup>th</sup> October 2008 Mexican Time:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pacific 18 Latitude 19-29.15N and Longitude 095-54.92W Pacific 38 Latitude
                        19-29.0N and Longitude 095-54.1W</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In accordance with the said Memoranda of Agreement please take delivery of
                        the vessels and make payment of the balance purchase price and R.O.B. Our
                        lawyers in Singapore Haridass Ho &amp; Partners are ready with all closing
                        documents to close this transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The NOR was promptly rejected by TMM on 29
                    October 2008. In an email to PRM,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> TMM explained that the
                    NOR was not valid as TMM had not received evidence that the items in the
                    Spreadsheets had been repaired. The Vessels were therefore not, in TMM’s
                    view, in every respect physically ready, as required under cl 5(a) of the
                    MOAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A series of emails were then exchanged between
                    the parties’ respective solicitors on or about 31 October 2008. The first
                    was from PRM’s solicitors, Haridass Ho &amp; Partners
                    (“HHP”), stating that PRM treated TMM’s rejection of the NOR
                    as a repudiatory breach of the MOAs which PRM accepted. PRM nevertheless
                    reiterated that it had complied with the terms of the MOAs, and despite having
                    accepted TMM’s purported repudiation, offered the latter a chance to
                    purchase the Vessels on the same terms as per the MOAs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This was followed by a response from
                    TMM’s solicitors, Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (“A&amp;G”), in
                    which TMM denied that it had breached the MOAs by rejecting the NOR. A&amp;G
                    pointed to cl 5(a) of the MOAs and highlighted that the Vessels were not in
                    every respect physically ready given that the repairs in the Spreadsheets had
                    not yet been completed. In particular, ABS had not yet classified <em>The Pacific 18</em> with DP-1 Class notation. A&amp;G noted
                    that PRM’s wrongful rejection of TMM’s refusal to accept the NOR was
                    itself a repudiation of the MOAs. In these circumstances, TMM reserved its right
                    to accept PRM’s repudiation but was prepared to await a valid NOR for the
                        Vessels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     HHP responded, maintaining PRM’s
                    position that TMM had repudiated the MOAs. It added that TMM’s
                    superintendents were on board the Vessels throughout the repairs at the dry dock
                    and shipyard and had inspected all the works. On the DP-1 Class notation,
                    PRM’s stance was that the ABS had inspected the DP-1 systems, and
                    arrangements had been made to issue the DP-1 Class notations. That was the
                    extent of PRM’s obligation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 1 November 2008, A&amp;G again stressed
                    that the Vessels were not physically ready in every respect as they had not been
                    classed with DP-1 Class notation, which was an express term under the MOAs.
                    Other equipment on <em>The Pacific 18</em> were also not
                    functioning. Nevertheless, TMM remained ready to perform the MOAs as long as PRM
                    tendered a valid NOR for the Vessels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The impasse remained. On 9 November 2008,
                    A&amp;G informed HHP that as the time for delivery of the Vessels was 7 November
                    2008 and PRM had not issued a NOR for the Vessels, PRM had repudiated the MOAs.
                    Consequently, TMM accepted PRM’s repudiation and demanded PRM’s
                    consent to the release of the Deposit held by Platou to TMM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     PRM did not consent to Platou releasing the
                    Deposit to TMM. Eventually, on 9 December 2008, TMM commenced the Arbitration
                    against PRM claiming, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Deposit
                    be released to TMM as well as damages arising from PRM’s alleged
                    repudiatory breach of the MOAs. The parties initially appointed Mr Thean Lip
                    Ping as the sole arbitrator (“Mr Thean”). However, Mr Thean
                    withdrew subsequently because of an unforeseen event. Mr G P Selvam (“the
                    Arbitrator”) was then appointed as the sole arbitrator on 21 December
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Memorandum of Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The parties’ arguments have to be read
                    together with the Memorandum of Issues (“MOI”) for the separate
                    arbitrations concerning each of the Vessels which, at that time, had not been
                    consolidated. This only happened on 7 February 2011, after the Arbitrator was
                    appointed. Each MOI was drawn up by Mr Thean in consultation with the
                        parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The most important section of each
                    MOI for the purposes of these proceedings, headed “Main Issues”,
                    sets out the main issues in the dispute for each Vessel, albeit it was expressly
                    stated to be neither exhaustive nor immutable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It also

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Save for a couple of minor issues which were
                    peculiar to <em>The Pacific 18</em>, the MOIs for both
                    disputes were for most parts identical. In effect, there were 11 broad issues in
                    dispute in the Arbitration. Restated, these included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the NOR was valid and in
                        compliance with the MOA. In particular, whether:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       PRM was obliged to arrange
                            for the ABS to issue a class certificate for the Vessels with DP-1 Class
                            notation at the time of delivery;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       PRM was obliged to ensure that the DP system on
                            each vessel was functioning and operating, and if there was such an
                            obligation, whether the DP system was in fact functioning and
                            operating;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       all the repairs in the Spreadsheets were
                            completed by PRM; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       PRM failed to allow TTM’s representatives
                            to physically witness the repairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether TMM’s refusal to accept
                        PRM’s NOR was in breach of the MOAs, and if so, whether such breach
                        amounted to a repudiatory breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     If TMM was not in breach or repudiatory breach of the
                        MOAs, whether PRM was in repudiatory breach of the MOAs in the circumstances
                        that occurred between 28 October 2008 and 7 November
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     The relief to
                        be awarded to either party for the other’s breach, if any, including
                        the question of who the Deposit should be paid to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was apparent from the MOI, as well as the
                    parties’ submissions, that the validity of the NOR was central to the
                    dispute. More specifically, the key factual issues with respect to the validity
                    of the NOR were whether the Vessels were, at the time the NOR was issued,
                    classed by ABS with DP-1 Class notation, and whether the DP-1 system on board
                    each vessel was functioning and operational.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">TMM’s case in the Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     TMM framed its submissions according to the
                    list of issues in the MOIs. Each issue was argued comprehensively, with the
                        closing<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and reply submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> totalling 320 pages,
                    including annexes. On the central issue of the validity of the NOR, TMM’s
                    arguments before the Arbitrator were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Specifications described the
                        Vessels as having DP-1 capability, DP-1 equipment, and DP-1 Class
                            notation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     In addition to the Specifications, PRM
                        had a duty to ensure that the items in the Spreadsheets were repaired at the
                        time of delivery. This duty was more than a goodwill gesture as claimed by
                        PRM; it was a contractual obligation under the MOAs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Flowing from the above, the requirement under cl
                        5(a) of the MOAs that the Vessels be “in every respect physically
                        ready for delivery” had two aspects. First, the Vessels must fit the
                        description in the Specifications, particularly those related to the DP-1
                            system.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Second, the repairs in the
                        Spreadsheets, particularly those related to the DP-1 system, must be
                        completed. The DP-1 system must not only be functioning and operational, the
                        Vessels must be certified by ABS with a DP-1 Class notation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Vessels were only
                        physically ready in every respect if these two aspects were
                        satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Vessels were not physically ready in every respect when the NOR was
                        issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       For <em>The
                                Pacific 18</em>, there was no evidence to show that the DP-1
                            Class notation had been restored. A Confirmation of Class certificate
                            issued by ABS dated 28 October 2008 in fact contained all the notations
                            except the DP-1 Class notation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> There was
                            also no evidence that the DP-1 system was functioning. Several parts of
                            the system such as the fan beam, acoustic tracking system, and certain
                            sensors had not been tested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       For <em>The Pacific
                                38</em>, there was similarly no Class certificate issued by
                            ABS restoring the DP-1 Class notation at the time the NOR was issued.
                            The DP-1 Class notation was eventually restored only on 5 November
                                2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Further, the DP-1 system was not
                            functioning as the trials on 22 October 2008 showed that there were
                            defects with certain parts of the DP-1 system. Other parts had also not
                            been tested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">PRM’s case in the Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     PRM denied that it had breached the MOAs, and
                    sought in its counterclaim for an order that Platou release the Deposit to PRM.
                    PRM’s position on the issue of the validity of the NOR was that the
                    Vessels did not have to be delivered with DP-1 capabilities, or need to be
                    certified as such by ABS. PRM referred to cl 11 of the MOAs (see [9]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     PRM contended:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     Following from the phrase “as
                        is where is” in cl 11, the Vessels only needed to be in the same
                        condition as they were at the time of inspection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The items
                        in the Spreadsheets could not impose on PRM new conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> PRM also
                        buttressed this position by stating that it had communicated to Platou when
                        returning the Spreadsheets that it would rectify the items in the
                        Spreadsheets “as owner’s goodwill” but that the items
                        were not additional obligations under the MOAs as the MOAs were entered into
                        on an “as is where is” basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following from the phrase “delivered physically
                        ready with her class maintained without condition/recommendation” in
                        cl 11, the Vessels were physically ready if their Class certificates were
                        valid and were the same certificates which were on the Vessels when they
                        were first inspected in late August 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> At the time of
                        delivery, the certificates available were the same as those present during
                        the initial inspection. They were also valid till 1 June 2010, beyond the
                        required three months after delivery under cl 11 of the
                    MOAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     PRM also did
                        not have an obligation to deliver the Vessels in a fully operational
                        condition. In the negotiations leading up to the MOAs, TMM had insisted on
                        the words “fully operational” upon delivery to remain in the
                        MOAs but PRM wanted them removed. They were ultimately removed. As such, it
                        was agreed that the condition of the Vessels at delivery needed only to
                        match the condition at the time of inspection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     Even if “physically ready” in cl 5(a) of
                        the MOAs meant that PRM had to deliver the Vessels with the requisite Class
                        certificate and fully functioning DP-1 systems, PRM’s failure to do so
                        amounted at most to a breach of an intermediate term, not a condition. TMM
                        might be entitled to damages, but it was not entitled to refuse to take
                        delivery of the Vessels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Confirmation of Class certificates
                        for the Vessels which were sent to TMM by PRM confirmed that the status of
                        the Vessels at that time was the same as on the date of the initial
                            inspection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Arbitrator’s decision was contained
                    in an award which was released to the parties on 28 November 2011 (“the
                    Award”). Spanning 62 pages and 151 paragraphs, the Award dismissed
                    TMM’s claims in respect of both <em>The Pacific
                        18</em> and <em>The Pacific 38</em>, and allowed
                    PRM’s counterclaim for the Deposit to be released by Platou to PRM. On the
                    validity of the NOR, the Arbitrator made, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following findings and conclusions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39.    The evidence before the Tribunal clearly
                            established that as of 29 October 2008 MT [Mexican Time], the Claimants
                            had not (a) deliberately put in place the financial arrangements for the
                            payment of the 90% balance of the purchase price of the Vessels to be
                            parked with DBS Bank as they said they would, (b) taken any measures for
                            the underwater inspection of the Vessels while the Vessels were in
                            drydock in Veracruz or afloat in port water in Veracruz before the
                            Respondents tendered their delivery of the Vessels; (c) made any
                            arrangements with ABS for the supervision of the underwater inspection
                            by divers or (d) made any arrangements for their Master and crew to take
                            possession of the Vessels on their behalf [<em>sic</em>]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [Correspondence between HHP and A&amp;G on behalf of their clients as
                        well as correspondence between DBS Bank and A&amp;G omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    In the result, the Claimants never paid nor
                            demonstrated their ability to pay the balance of the purchase price of
                            the Vessels as promised and resolutely refused to take delivery of the
                            Vessels. They say that the Respondents were in repudiatory breach of the
                            MOAs. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86.    ... [T]he Claimants during the hearing and in post
                            hearing submissions suggested that the sale of the Vessels might be
                            “sale by description”. The Tribunal cannot accept this
                            argument or submission. “Sale by description” is a term of
                            art in English law of sale of goods. According to English law of sale of
                            goods, where a second hand chattel such as <em>The
                                Pacific 18</em> or <em>The Pacific
                                38</em> is sold after inspection and acceptance by the buyers
                            ... and is to be “delivered and taken over, but as she was at the
                            time of inspection”, the sale is not a sale by description.
                                <em>It is an “as is where is” sale. It
                                remains to be so even if the seller agrees to make certain

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">TMM’s written submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Breach of the rules of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The rules of natural justice which Ms Vivian
                    Ang (“Ms Ang”), first counsel for TMM, claimed were breached were
                    (a) that TMM lacked an opportunity to be heard, and (b) that the Arbitrator was
                    apparently biased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Lack of opportunity to be heard </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Ms Ang gave a host of reasons why TMM was not
                    given an opportunity to be heard, chief of which were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, whether cl 11 of the MOAs was
                        a condition or warranty was not raised in the pleadings or MOI. Thus, no
                        arguments were presented by TMM on that issue. Yet, the Arbitrator examined
                        that issue on his own and relied on it in coming to his
                            decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Arbitrator disregarded TMM’s evidence
                        relating to its financial standing and ability to pay the balance purchase
                        price. TMM had adduced much evidence to show that it could complete the
                        purchase, but the Arbitrator had overlooked or did not deal with that
                        evidence. There was also no mention in the Award of the evidence adduced by
                            TMM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Arbitrator disregarded evidence from
                        TMM’s broker which, in TMM’s view, confirmed its assertion that
                        PRM had agreed to effect all the repairs as listed in the Spreadsheets. The
                        Arbitrator also completely ignored and failed to deal with evidence from
                        PRM’s own witness who allegedly admitted during cross-examination that
                        PRM was selling the Vessels as described in the Specifications which
                        expressly stated that the Vessels had DP-1 capabilities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Arbitrator did not refer
                        to any of the statements given by TMM’s 11 witnesses. On the face of
                        the Award, it appeared that the Arbitrator had paid no heed to the
                        statements of TMM’s witnesses and reached his conclusions without
                        considering that evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the Arbitrator ignored
                        TMM’s evidence on the physical condition of and the defects existing
                        in the Vessels at the time of the issuance of the NOR. He chose to sweep all
                        that evidence aside and rely solely on the ABS Surveys despite TMM’s
                        evidence to the contrary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, the Arbitrator held that the
                        repairs on <em>The Pacific 38</em> were completed
                        because he mistook the FiFi pump, a type of fire-fighting equipment, for the
                        Harbour Generator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Apparent bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Ms Ang again provided a plethora of reasons
                    why a reasonable person would develop a reasonable suspicion that the Arbitrator
                    was biased. These include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cross-examination of PRM’s
                        two factual witnesses raised serious doubts as to their credibility. One
                        gave evidence on a document which he had never seen before while the other
                        contradicted his witness statement. However, the Arbitrator accepted the
                        evidence from those witnesses as if there was nothing untoward about it and
                        made no mention of these discrepancies in his Award.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Arbitrator mentioned in the Award
                        that there was ample material in the form of documentary evidence to
                        conclude that all the repairs were successfully completed. However, he did
                        not state what those documentary evidence were. The ABS Surveys which the
                        Arbitrator accepted as evidence that the challenged items had been repaired
                        also did not contain any statement attesting to the state of the Vessels
                        before 5 November 2008. The Arbitrator also ignored the testimonies of
                        PRM’s own witnesses to the effect that certain repairs were not
                        completed until after the NOR was issued. In short, he blindly accepted the
                        confirmations in the ABS Surveys as determinative of the issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Arbitrator had a preconceived
                        notion that TMM’s witnesses were not credible or truthful. This was
                        manifested by his finding that TMM had deliberately not put in place the
                        financial arrangement for the payment of the balance purchase price, a
                        finding which went directly against the evidence given by TMM’s
                            witnesses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     Although the Arbitrator was an experienced
                        adjudicator, he committed an inordinate number of egregious errors of fact
                        and law. It was not that these errors themselves found a basis for setting
                        aside. Rather, these errors were indicative of an apparent bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       For instance, the Award
                            provided several seemingly conflicting interpretations of the phrase
                            “in every respect physically ready” under cl 5(a). At one
                            point, the Award stated that what was required to be physically ready
                            was the actual physical condition in contrast to the documentary
                            condition. At another point, the Award stated that the mere tendering of
                            the classification certificate was sufficient to prove the actual
                            physical state.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Another example was the
                            Arbitrator’s conclusion that TMM had manifestly repudiated the
                            MOAs by failing to make payment of the balance purchase price before the
                            expiry of 36 hours after the NOR was issued. This was illogical as TMM
                            could not have made payment, even if it wanted to, as PRM had, in its
                            reply, accepted TMM’s purported repudiation of the MOAs even
                            before the expiration of the 36 hours.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_30-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Last but not least, the Arbitrator
                            confused and conflated the rejection of a NOR with the termination of
                            the MOAs. TMM had a right to reject the NOR if the Vessels were not
                            physically ready in every respect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The Arbitrator did
                            not seem to have understood or tried to understand TMM’s case that
                            it was not terminating the MOAs by rejecting the NOR.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issues falling outside the scope of submission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Ms Ang only raised one argument under this
                    ground. She submitted that whether cl 11 of the MOAs was a condition which if
                    breached entitled PRM to terminate the MOAs was not an issue before the
                    Arbitrator. It was not in any of the pleadings or the MOI. In finding that cl 11
                    was not a condition such that TMM was not entitled to reject the NOR even if
                    there was a breach of cl 11, the Arbitrator had determined an issue which was
                    not in the terms of reference. He had therefore exceeded his authority as
                        arbitrator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PRM’s written submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr Haridass Ajaib (“Mr Ajaib”),
                    counsel for PRM, began his submissions with the established principle that the
                    court should not sit as an appellate tribunal over the Arbitrator. The grounds
                    for challenging the Award must be construed narrowly and strictly. In this
                    regard, TMM’s application must fail as the alleged breaches of natural
                    justice raised by TMM were vague, lacked contour, or fell outside the grounds
                    for setting aside an award.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr Ajaib divided his submissions into two
                    categories. The first was whether cl 11 of the MOAs was a condition was properly
                    before the Arbitrator. He argued that it was for the following
                        reasons:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was part of the issue under
                        paragraph 15(6) in the MOI, <em>viz</em>, whether TMM
                        was entitled to reject the NOR. In any event, the MOI itself stated that the
                        issues listed were neither exhaustive nor immutable, and the arbitral
                        tribunal could “in its discretion” rely on additional facts or
                        law which were necessary to decide the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     Apart from the MOI, it was clear from the
                        parties’ pleadings that whether TMM was entitled to reject the NOR was
                        a live issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     PRM’s closing submissions addressed whether cl 11 was a condition.
                        TMM had ample opportunity – 21 days – to address this in its
                        reply submissions but it chose not to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second category was on whether breaches of
                    the rules of natural justice had occurred. Mr Ajaib submitted that none had
                    occurred as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Arbitrator’s treatment of
                        the evidence was proper. He did not deprive TMM of an opportunity to be
                        heard nor was he apparently biased as:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Arbitrator had the
                            power under Art 19 of the Model Law to conduct the arbitration in such
                            manner as he considered appropriate, including determining the
                            admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any
                                evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The mere fact that the Arbitrator did not list
                            or make explicit reference to TMM’s witnesses did not mean that he
                            had disregarded its evidence. Indeed, the Arbitrator had expressly
                            stated in the Award that he had considered both parties’
                            submissions and evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The allegation that the
                            Arbitrator had preconceived views about TMM’s witnesses was also
                            vague, frivolous, bare and meaningless.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Even if there was a
                            disregard of TMM’s submissions and evidence, that was not a ground
                            for setting aside an award. It is trite law that even if the arbitral
                            tribunal was manifestly unreasonable in coming to a conclusion, as long
                            as it had conducted the arbitration fairly, the court should not be
                            concerned with the substantive outcome.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Arbitrator had not made the
                        egregious errors alleged by TMM. Even if there were numerous egregious
                        errors, such errors cannot be raised as a ground for setting aside an
                            award.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Ajaib concluded his written submissions by
                    reiterating that the court’s role is not to retry issues. He urged the
                    court to protect the finality of arbitration proceedings by adhering to the
                    policy of minimal curial intervention.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Oral submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The oral arguments for these proceedings
                    stretched over several days, during which TMM’s counsel made substantial
                    arguments in addition to their written submissions. I shall briefly summarise
                    the thrust of those submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, Ms Ang stated that the heart of the
                    issue on the validity of the NOR comprised three elements: (a) whether or not
                    the Vessels were in fact in every respect physically ready; (b) whether or not
                    TMM’s rejection of the NOR was justified; and (c) whether or not
                    TMM’s rejection of the NOR amounted to a repudiatory breach.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> One of the elements which the Arbitrator did
                    not address was the law on repudiation. According to Ms Ang, the law on
                    repudiation is that a person should not accept what he thinks is a repudiatory
                    breach unless it is so plainly obvious that the other party has
                        repudiated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> Even if the items in the Spreadsheets
                    had all been repaired, the Arbitrator ought to have considered whether TMM had
                    evinced such an unambiguous intention not to perform the MOAs before concluding
                    that TMM had repudiated the MOAs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> He did
                        not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> She stressed that on the face
                    of the NOR and the surrounding circumstances, there could be no inference of an
                    intention by TMM to repudiate the MOAs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>
                    In other words, there was a “missing link” in his
                        reasoning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, Mr Andrew Chan (“Mr
                    Chan”), second counsel for TMM, clarified that the issues raised by Ms
                    Ang and himself not only showed apparent bias. They also showed that the
                    Arbitrator had disregarded TMM’s submissions or failed to try to
                    understand them, thereby depriving TMM of a right to be heard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> While an arbitral tribunal is not
                    expected to understand all submissions put forth by counsel, Mr Chan stressed
                    that the law requires the arbitral tribunal to show that it has attempted to
                    understand the submissions. If the arbitral tribunal did not even try to
                    comprehend the submissions, and swept them under the carpet as if they were not
                    there, that would have deprived the party making the submissions of the
                    opportunity to be heard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     TMM’s submissions on the right to be
                    heard and apparent bias had numerous overlaps. It was not clear when a
                    submission went towards establishing the breach of one rule or the other or
                    both. To be fair to both Ms Ang and Mr Chan, the same facts can often sustain
                    both grounds. Thus, putting aside the labels, the two major complaints of TMM
                    can be broadly characterised as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Arbitrator had breached the
                        rules of natural justice by disregarding and ignoring TMM’s
                        submissions; and/or not fully explaining his reasons for his conclusions;
                        and/or making findings which were not in issue before him and/or not
                        applying his mind fully to the issues before him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Arbitrator had exceeded his
                        jurisdiction by determining an issue which was not listed in the MOI, that
                        is, the issue of whether cl 11 of the MOAs was a condition which if breached
                        entitled PRM to terminate the MOAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     TMM’s arguments on natural justice can
                    be further grouped into four categories, each establishing an independent duty
                    of the arbitral tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     the duty to give reasons and
                        explanations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     the duty to attempt to understand the parties’
                    submissions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        duty to deal with every argument presented; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     the duty to not look beyond the parties’
                        submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I must point out that in addition to natural
                    justice, TMM’s arguments in categories (c) and (d) actually straddled
                    another ground for challenge, <em>viz</em>, excess of
                    jurisdiction pursuant to Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the
                    Model Law. This is because arbitral awards that fail to deal with issues that
                    should have been dealt with, or dealt with more issues than ought have been
                    dealt with are <em>infra petita</em> and <em>ultra petita</em> respectively: <em>Fouchard, Gaillard
                        and Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Emmanuel
                    Gaillard and John Savage eds) (Kluwer Law International, 1999) at para 987.
                    Although there is no Singapore decision that explicitly states that awards
                        <em>infra petita</em> may be challenged under Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), it would appear from the Court
                    of Appeal’s decision in <em>CRW Joint Operation v PT
                        Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR 305
                        (“<em>CRW</em>”) at [31] and [33] that
                    Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) covers such awards. As such, I
                    will deal with the arguments on both the natural justice and excess of
                    jurisdiction bases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General principles for curial scrutiny </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When a challenge is brought against an award,
                    the court has a duty to entertain and engage the challenge. That is what the IAA
                    and Model Law provide and that is what the court must do. If the complaint
                    against the award is that the arbitral tribunal did too much or did not do what
                    it was supposed to do, regardless of whether one couches the challenge under
                    natural justice or excess of jurisdiction, the court is effectively asked to
                    review the actions or inactions of the arbitral tribunal. Invariably, the court
                    must look at the evidence on the record to determine the merits of the
                    challenge. However, it does not follow, and neither do I accept, that this
                    process <em>always</em> entails sifting through the entire
                    record of the arbitral proceedings with a fine-tooth comb.</p>

                    the Court of Appeal cautioned (at [65(c)–(f)]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [F]airness justifies a policy of minimal curial intervention,
                        which has become common as a matter of international practice. To elaborate,
                        minimal curial intervention is underpinned by two principal considerations.
                        First, there is a need to recognise the autonomy of the arbitral process by
                        encouraging finality, so that its advantage as an efficient alternative
                        dispute resolution process is not undermined. Second, having opted for
                        arbitration, parties must be taken to have acknowledged and accepted the
                        attendant risks of having only a very limited right of recourse to the
                        courts. It would be neither appropriate nor consonant for a dissatisfied
                        party to seek the assistance of the court to intervene on the basis that the
                        court is discharging an appellate function, save in the very limited
                        circumstances that have been statutorily condoned. Generally speaking, a
                        court will not intervene merely because it might have resolved the various
                        controversies in play differently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It must always be borne in mind that it is not the function of
                        the court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in
                        attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral
                        process; rather, an award should be read generously such that only
                        meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice that have actually
                        caused prejudice are ultimately remedied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     To that I would add the observations in the
                    English High Court case of <em>Atkins Limited v The Secretary of
                        State for Transport</em> [2013] EWHC 139 (TCC) where Akenhead J stated
                    [at 36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I consider that it is very important that, where the Court is asked to
                        conduct an exercise to determine whether or not in reality and substance an
                        arbitrator has failed to deal with all the issues put to it within the
                        meaning of Section 68(2)(d), <em>the Court is not required to
                            carry out a hypercritical or excessively syntactical analysis of what
                            the arbitrator has written</em>. This is particularly so where the
                        arbitrator in question is not only eminent and highly respected in his field
                        but also has immense legal experience in the relevant field of law
                        concerned. <em>In a clear and obvious case, of course the
                            Court will find that the ground exists and can then move on to consider
                            whether or not the circumstances merit interfering with the
                            award</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The court should not nit-pick at the award.
                    Infelicities are to be expected and are generally irrelevant to the merits of
                    any challenge: see <em>IRB Brasil Resseguros SA v CX Reinsurance
                        Company Ltd</em> [2010] EWHC 974 (Comm) (“<em>IRB Brasil</em>”) at [47]. In <em>Zermalt
                        Holdings SA v Nu-Life Upholstery Repairs Ltd</em> [1985] 2 EGLR 14
                        (“<em>Zermalt</em>”), Bingham J stated
                    (at 14):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As a matter of general approach, the courts strive to uphold
                        arbitration awards. <em>They do not approach them with a
                            meticulous legal eye endeavouring to pick holes, inconsistencies and
                            faults in awards</em> and with the objective of upsetting or
                        frustrating the process of arbitration. Far from it. The approach is to read
                        an arbitration award in a reasonable and commercial way, expecting, as is
                        usually the case, that there will be <em>no substantial
                            fault</em> that can be found with it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Bingham J’s statement has been cited
                    with approval in numerous English decisions and represents the prevailing
                    approach in England: see for <em>eg</em>, <em>ABB AG v Hochtief Airport GmbH and another</em> [2006] 2
                    Lloyd’s Law Rep (“<em>Hochtief</em>”)
                    at [64]; <em>IRB Brasil</em> at [31]; and <em>Fidelity Management SA &amp; Ors v Myriad International Holdings BV
                        &amp; Or</em> [2005] EWHC 1193 (Comm) at [2].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It should also not be forgotten that one of
                    the main reasons for choosing arbitration is the fact that arbitrators are
                    commercially minded persons with expertise and experience with the
                    subject-matter which may be extremely technical. Their value to the parties
                    comes from their knowledge of the trade, and not necessarily their knowledge of
                    the law. Some may have a legal background, but the legislation and rules usually
                    do not prescribe a law degree or training as a prerequisite for appointment as
                    an arbitrator. This is not a suggestion that a lower standard is expected of
                    such arbitrators but a reminder that if parties have agreed to appoint specific
                    individuals to preside over their disputes, they should be held to their
                    agreement to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     There may be a potential objection to the
                    general use of English authorities which I might as well dispose of now. I am
                    cognisant that the English arbitration regime is governed by the English
                    Arbitration Act 1996 (“1996 Act”) and not the Model Law. The 1996
                    Act is – it could be said – a different creature from the Model Law.
                    For that reason, some might consider English decisions as unhelpful, and that
                    regard should be had instead to other common law jurisdictions which have
                    adopted the Model Law such as Australia, Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I accept all of that. Nevertheless, while it
                    would be justified to treat English decisions on arbitration with some degree of
                    caution, to ignore them completely would be throwing the baby out with the
                    bathwater. The 1996 Act was, after all, drafted with close regard to the Model
                    Law: see Departmental Advisory Committee on Arbitration Law, <em>Report on the Arbitration Bill</em> (February 1996) (Chairman: Lord
                    Justice Saville QC) (the “<em>DAC
                    Report</em>”) at para 4. There are therefore numerous similarities
                    in language and philosophy. That is also why the English courts occasionally
                    refer to the Model Law: see for <em>eg Sovarex SA v Romero
                        Alvarez SA</em> [2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 320; and <em>Sea Trade Maritime Corporation v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association
                        (Bermuda) Ltd (The “Athena”)</em> [2006] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 147. Good judicial common sense should dictate whether an English decision
                    should be of meaningful persuasive value. If an issue falls to be decided under
                    the 1996 Act in the same way and under the same principles that would apply
                    under the Model Law and IAA, I can see no reason militating against a Singapore
                    court having regard to a decision of the English court on that
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the intensity of curial scrutiny, the
                    prevailing English approach is undoubtedly instructive because it is informed by
                    the principle of minimal curial intervention which is similarly, if not equally,
                    forceful in England (see the <em>DAC Report</em> at para
                    22; and <em>Lesotho Highlands Development Authority v Impregilo
                        SpA and others</em> [2006] 1 AC 221 at [26]–[27]) as it is in
                    Singapore (see <em>Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig
                        Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (“<em>Tjong</em>”) at [29]). Similarly, the English
                    arbitration cases on natural justice are also useful as the concept of natural
                    justice under the English arbitration regime is not any different from that
                    under the Singapore arbitration regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Excess of jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The law on setting aside an award on the
                    ground of excess of jurisdiction under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law is relatively settled. It has been clearly
                    explained in a handful of Court of Appeal decisions, the most recent being
                        <em>PT Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA
                        and other appeals</em> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<em>Kempinski</em>”). According to the wording of Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), there is an excess of
                    jurisdiction if the arbitral tribunal deals with a dispute not contemplated by
                    or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or decides on
                    matters that are outside of the scope of the submission to the arbitration.
                    Although “matters” is not defined in the Model Law, the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank
                        SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<em>PT Asuransi</em>”), in interpreting Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii), held (at [37]) that the arbitral tribunal
                    “has no jurisdiction to decide any <em>issue</em>
                    not referred to it for determination” [emphasis added]. Thus, the
                    determination of an issue which has not been submitted to arbitration will also
                    render that part of the award liable to be set aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In some cases, whether a particular matter or
                    issue in dispute has been submitted to the arbitral tribunal is contentious.
                    Sometimes, as in the present case, the parties will submit a memorandum of
                    issues. However, that may not be exhaustive proof of the matters that are within
                    the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction. In the first place, memoranda of
                    issues may contain catch-all provisions which give arbitral tribunals the
                    discretion to decide on matters which are not expressly listed. Indeed, in the
                    present case, the MOI conferred on the Arbitrator the discretion to rely on
                    additional facts or law which are necessary to decide the dispute. Furthermore,
                    as stated in <em>Kempinski</em> at [33], pleadings and its
                    contents are also relevant as they illuminate the matters that have been
                    submitted to the arbitral tribunal. In fact, <em>Kempinski</em> recognised (at [47]) that “any new fact or
                    change in the law arising after a submission to arbitration which is ancillary
                    to the dispute submitted for arbitration and which is known to all the parties
                    to the arbitration is part of that dispute and need not be specifically
                    pleaded”. Hence, an issue which surfaces in the course of the arbitration
                    and is known to all the parties would be considered to have been submitted to
                    the arbitral tribunal even if it is not part of any memorandum of issues or
                    pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Last but not least, even if a party is able to
                    show that the arbitral tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction pursuant to Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law, the award may
                    still not be set aside. The crucial question in every case, as the Court of
                    Appeal puts it in <em>CRW</em> at [32], is “whether
                    there has been real or actual prejudice to either (or both) [or all] of the
                    parties to the dispute”. As the editors of Nigel Blackaby <em>et al</em>, <em>Redfern and Hunter on
                        International Arbitration</em> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2009)
                    stated at para 10.40 (which was cited by the court in <em>CRW</em> with approval at [32]), “[t]he significance of the
                    issues that were not dealt with has to be considered in relation to the award as
                    a whole”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I cannot agree with Ms Ang’s submission
                    that the Arbitrator did not have the jurisdiction to determine whether cl 11 of
                    the MOAs was a condition or not. Paragraph 15 of the MOI sets out the <em>main</em> issues in the arbitration:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Main Issues</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Without limiting the scope of the Cases of the
                            Claimant and the Respondent respectively, on the basis of Parties’
                            written Statements and in consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal
                            identifies the following as the main issues in this
                        arbitration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The words in paragraph 15 of the MOI suggest
                    that the issues set out in the MOI are intended to assist in the identification
                    of the <em>main</em> areas of contention. The list is
                    inclusive, rather than exclusive or exhaustive. Paragraph 16 erases any doubt to
                    the contrary:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    For avoidance of doubt, the main issues as stated
                            above are neither exhaustive nor immutable, and subsequently, additional
                            issues of fact or law may arise, which the Tribunal, in its discretion,
                            may deem necessary in deciding its arbitral award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In my view, TMM’s case is untenable for
                    these reasons alone. But even if the issues in the MOI were exhaustive, I would
                    have found that whether cl 11 amounted to a condition or not was an issue which
                    would fit comfortably into the sixth issue in the list which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    Whether the Claimant’s notice dated 29
                            October 2008 refusing to accept the Respondent’s Notice of
                            Delivery dated 28 October 2008 as a valid Notice of Readiness for the
                            delivery of [the Vessels] was in breach of the MOA, and <em>if it was, whether such breach amounted to a repudiatory
                                breach</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The parties had, pursuant to issue (6), asked
                    the arbitral tribunal to determine whether TMM’s refusal to accept the NOR
                    was a repudiatory breach. In these circumstances, it was certainly open to the
                    Arbitrator, in reading issue (6), to take the view that he ought to determine
                    whether cl 11 was a condition because that would have a bearing on the question
                    of whether TMM had repudiated the MOAs. Moreover, it is clear from the
                    parties’ submissions in the Arbitration that the nature of cl 11 was in
                    issue. TMM in fact made reference to those submissions in its submissions before
                        me.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Last but not least, for
                    the reasons mentioned at [67]–[69] below, it is beyond question that the
                    nature of cl 11 was always in issue between the parties. The Arbitrator
                    therefore did not exceed his jurisdiction as understood under Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rules of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It is trite that natural justice demands
                    faithful observance of the two famous maxims, <em>audi alteram
                        partem</em> and <em>nemo iudex in causa sua</em>.
                    However, what does affording an opportunity to be heard exactly entail? Does it
                    require the arbitral tribunal (a) to give parties a chance to respond to every
                    single argument raised by their opponents or every factual and legal premise
                    which the arbitral tribunal intends to rely on, and (b) to address all the
                    arguments canvassed and evidence its consideration by explaining why it accepted
                    or rejected each argument? Similarly, does the rule against being a judge in his
                    own cause preclude an arbitrator from forming an opinion before the conclusion
                    of the arbitration and if he does so, must he recuse himself?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     These are painstakingly obvious questions.
                    Yet, the law in Singapore has not developed clear answers, albeit it has
                    provided some broad guiding principles. In <em>Soh Beng
                        Tee</em>, the Court of Appeal surveyed decisions on natural justice
                    from multiple Commonwealth jurisdictions, and summarised (at [65]) a list of
                    principles which the court should have regard to when confronted with a natural
                    justice challenge to an award. These include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     Arbitrators who exercise
                        unreasonable initiative without the parties’ involvement may attract
                        serious and sustainable challenges.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     The failure of an arbitrator to refer every point for
                        decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for
                        challenge. A court <em>may</em> only intervene in
                        instances where:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_59-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the impugned decision
                            reveals a dramatic departure from the parties’
                        submissions;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_59-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous
                        evidence;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_59-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence
                            adduced by the parties; or</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_59-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       the conclusion is unequivocally rejected by the
                            parties as being trivial or irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     The arbitral tribunal is entitled to
                        embrace a solution or conclusion which lies somewhere in between the
                        parties’ submissions. It is not bound to take an either/or approach.
                        The arbitral tribunal may do so even without apprising the parties of its
                        thinking or analysis, so long as it is based on evidence that is before the
                        arbitral tribunal. It is only where the arbitral tribunal’s reasoning
                        involves a dramatic departure from what has been presented to it that the
                        arbitral tribunal should consult the parties on its thought process before
                        finalising the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In my view, the emphasis in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> is on the <em>extent</em> of
                    departure from the evidence and submissions before the arbitral tribunal without
                    any advance notice. The more surprising the decision and its reasoning –
                    <em>ie</em> the more inexplicable it is in the light of the
                    evidence and submissions – the more likely it is that the arbitral
                    tribunal has crossed from permissible discretionary decision-making into the
                    forbidden territory of impermissible breach of natural justice. In terms of
                    practical application, the question remains: what is – in the words of the
                    court in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> – a “dramatic
                    departure” or “unreasonable initiative” by the arbitral
                    tribunal? What is the level of departure or unreasonableness beyond which it can
                    be said that the rules of natural justice have been breached?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Perhaps it is because the requirements of
                    natural justice ultimately depend on the circumstances of each case (<em>Russell v Duke of Norfolk</em> [1949] 1 All ER 109 at 113)
                    that the test for when the line has been crossed is inherently vague. To borrow
                    the words of Ungoed-Thomas J in <em>Lawlor and Others v Union of
                        Post Office Workers</em> [1965] Ch 712 at 718, the content of the
                    rules of natural justice is generally “lacking in
                    precision”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Nevertheless, I shall attempt to delineate the
                    content and scope of the four sub-rules of natural justice relied upon by TMM
                    (see [40] above). I should re-state at the outset that TMM recycled some of the
                    factual allegations across multiple sub-rules. In the interest of avoiding
                    excessive repetition, I have placed the allegations under the sub-rule which in
                    my view best encapsulates the heart of the argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty to not look beyond submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Pacific Recreation Pte
                        Ltd v SY Technology Inc</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491, the Court of Appeal
                    held (at [30]) that a court or arbitral tribunal might be in breach of the rules
                    of natural justice if it decided a case on a ground not raised or contemplated
                    by the parties. That is uncontroversial. There is, however, a nuanced difference
                    between deciding the dispute on a ground that has never been expressly raised or
                    contemplated, and deciding the dispute on a premise which, though not directly
                    raised, is reasonably connected to an argument which was in fact raised. In this
                    regard, I gratefully adopt the observation of Tomlinson J in <em>Hochtief</em> at [72]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not consider that the duty to act fairly required the tribunal
                            <em>to refer back to the parties its analysis of the
                            material and the additional conclusion which it derived from the
                            resolution of arguments as to the essential issues which were already
                            squarely before it</em>. In my judgment, ABB had had a fair
                        opportunity to address its arguments on all of the essential building blocks
                        in the tribunal’s conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     There is also some support from the New
                    Zealand High Court’s decision in <em>Trustees of Rotoaira
                        Forest Trust v Attorney-General</em> [1999] 2 NZLR 452
                        (“<em>Rotoaira</em>”) which was cited
                    favourably in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [57]. After a survey
                    of English and New Zealand cases, the court in <em>Rotoaira</em> stated (at 463):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    In the absence of express or implied agreement to
                            the contrary, the arbitrator will normally be precluded from taking into
                            account evidence or argument extraneous to the hearing without giving
                            the parties further notice and the opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    The last principle extends to the
                            arbitrator’s own opinions and ideas <em>if these
                                were not reasonably foreseeable as potential corollaries of these
                                opinions and ideas which were expressly traversed during the
                                hearing</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    On the other hand, <em>an
                                arbitrator is not bound to slavishly adopt the position advocated by
                                one party or the other</em>. It will usually be no cause for
                            surprise that arbitrators make their own assessments of evidentiary
                            weight and credibility, pick and choose between different aspects of an
                            expert’s evidence, <em>reshuffle the way in which
                                different concepts have been combined</em>, make their own
                            value judgments between the extremes presented, <em>and
                                exercise reasonable latitude in drawing their own conclusions from

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    
              <em>Nor is an arbitrator under any

                            of criticising his mental processes before he finally commits
                            himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    It follows from these principles that <em>when it comes to ideas rather than facts, the overriding
                                task for the plaintiff is to show that a reasonable litigant in his
                                shoes would not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the
                                type revealed in the award</em>, and further, that with
                            adequate notice it might have been possible to persuade the arbitrator
                            to a different result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I accept that there might be – and
                    probably are – authorities suggesting the contrary. There is no uniformity
                    in the authorities on the extent to which the arbitral tribunal may decide a
                    pleaded issue using premises not argued by the parties but which were reasonably
                    connected to arguments canvassed by the parties. The interpretation of
                    authorities is further compounded by the fact that natural justice cases almost
                    inevitably turn on the individual facts of the case. Nevertheless, the
                    foundational principle which courts should not lose sight of is that parties who
                    choose arbitration as their preferred system of dispute resolution must live
                    with the decision of the arbitrator, good or bad. Commercial parties appoint
                    arbitrators for their expertise and experience, technical, legal, commercial or
                    otherwise. These arbitrators cannot be so straightjacketed as to be permitted to
                        <em>only</em> adopt in their conclusions the premises
                    put forward by the parties. If an unargued premise flows reasonably from an
                    argued premise, I do not think that it is necessarily incumbent on the arbitral
                    tribunal to invite the parties to submit new arguments. The arbitral tribunal
                    would be doing nothing more than inferring a related premise from one that has
                    been placed before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As mentioned earlier in the context of Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law (see
                    [54]–[56]), I disagree with the submission that the Arbitrator had, in
                    determining the nature of cl 11 of the MOAs, dealt with an issue outside of the
                    scope of submissions. I also disagree with the submission that because the point
                    that cl 11 was a warranty, and not a condition or innominate term, was not part
                    of either party’s submissions, the Arbitrator’s determination that
                    cl 11 was a collateral warranty occasioned a breach of the rules of natural
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     First, at the very least, as TMM conceded in
                    its written submissions in these proceedings, whether cl 11 was a condition or
                    an innominate term was an issue before the Arbitrator:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33.    
              <em>After stating at paragraph 98
                                of the Award that Clause 11 was an innominate or intermediate term,
                                the Tribunal then referred to Clause 11 as a collateral warranty
                                [references omitted]. The Tribunal knowing the difference in the
                                legal nature of the term appears to have contradicted itself and
                                characterised Clause 11 as both an innominate or intermediate term
                                and a warranty</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.    In fact, the Defendant [PRM] at <b><em>paragraph 485</em></b> of its Closing Submissions very
                            helpfully sets out the difference in the classes of contractual terms.
                            “A warranty is a term, breach of which sounds in damages but does
                            not terminate, or entitle the other party to terminate, the contract. An
                            innominate or intermediate term is one, the effect of non-performance of
                            which the parties expressly or (as is more usual) impliedly agree will
                            depend upon the nature and the consequences of
                        breach.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35.    The Tribunal has contradicted itself and made an
                            inconsistent finding on Clause 11 without giving any reasons as to why
                            Clause 11 was a warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    Further, it was neither party’s case that
                            Clause 11 was a warranty. <b><em>The Defendant [PRM] sets
                                out clearly at paragraph 33 of its Closing Submissions that Clause
                                11 was an intermediate or innominate term.</em></b> The Tribunal
                            in finding that Clause 11 was a warranty had ignored all the
                            parties’ submissions and went to make a determination on its
                            own.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Curiously, although TMM stated that “it
                    was neither party’s case that Clause 11 was a warranty”, the
                    converse is actually true. In the same paragraph 485 of PRM’s submissions
                    that TMM cited, PRM made it clear that its case was that cl 11 was not a
                    condition, but either a warranty or an innominate term which had the effect of a

                    issue, it was expressly part of PRM’s case that the breach of cl 11 did
                    not entitle termination of the MOAs because cl 11 was a warranty. This is not
                    even a case where the impugned argument is only reasonably connected to and not
                    actually part of any party’s submissions. It is curious and ambitious of
                    TMM to submit that the issue of whether cl 11 was a warranty was never in issue
                    in the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     But even if TMM was right, and the only issue
                    which <em>it</em> had put before the Arbitrator was whether
                    cl 11 was a condition or innominate term, I do not think that it can be said
                    that the Arbitrator, in deciding that cl 11 was a collateral warranty, had
                    deprived TMM of its right to be heard. TMM’s submission as can be inferred
                    from the extract above appears to be that because its case had restricted the
                    possibility of cl 11 being either a condition or an innominate term <em>simpliciter</em>, the Arbitrator was bound to find that cl 11
                    was an innominate term if he did not think that it was a condition. I cannot see
                    the principle or logic behind this restraint. The finding that cl 11 was a
                    collateral warranty was not only reasonably connected to the arguments raised by
                    both parties; it was a reasonable follow-through from his finding that cl 11 was
                    not a condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Accordingly, I reject the argument that the
                    Arbitrator’s determination that cl 11 was a warranty had deprived TMM of
                    its right to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty to deal with every argument presented </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     An arbitral tribunal is not obliged to deal
                    with every argument. It is neither practical nor realistic to require otherwise.
                    Toulson J summed up neatly the extent of the arbitral tribunal’s
                    obligation in <em>Ascot Commodities NV v Olam International
                        Ltd</em> [2002] CLC 277 at 284 (see also <em>Hochtief</em> at [80]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Nor is it incumbent on arbitrators to deal with <em>every argument on every point raised. But an award should deal,
                            however concisely, with all </em><b><em>essential
                            </em></b><em>issues</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     All that is required of the arbitral tribunal
                    is to ensure that the <em>essential issues</em> are dealt
                    with. The arbitral tribunal need not deal with each <em>point</em> made by a party in an arbitration: <em>Hussman (Europe) Ltd v Al Ameen Development and Trade Co</em> [2000]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 83 (“<em>Hussman</em>”)
                    at [56]. In determining the essential issues, the arbitral tribunal also should
                    not have to deal with <em>every</em> argument canvassed
                    under each of the essential issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     What then is considered
                    “essential”? This is not easy to define. Notwithstanding, in my
                    view, arbitral tribunals must be given fair latitude in determining what is
                    essential and what is not. An arbitral tribunal has the prerogative and must be
                    entitled to take the view that the dispute before it may be disposed of without
                    further consideration of certain issues. A court may take a contrary view
                        <em>ex post facto</em>, but it should not be too ready
                    to intervene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It may be queried whether the line between
                    issues and arguments is too fine. I do not think so. An argument is a
                    proposition that inclines towards a specific conclusion. It typically contains
                    reasons or premises, either factual or legal or both, which are presented as
                    driving one towards a particular conclusion. An issue, on the other hand, is a
                    topic. It is non-prescriptive, and usually expressed as a
                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In proposing that the issue should be
                    determined in its favour, a party may submit different arguments that could
                    operate cumulatively or independently. As long as one argument resolves the
                    issue, there is no justification for insisting that the arbitral tribunal go on
                    to consider the other arguments which have been rendered academic. In <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 733 (“<em>SEF</em>”), Judith Prakash J
                    held (at [60]) that “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should
                    be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions
                    made.” I completely agree. It is the right to be heard and not a right to
                    receive responses to all the submissions or arguments presented that is
                    protected. Although <em>SEF</em> was about a curial review
                    of an adjudicator’s decision under the Building and Construction Industry
                    Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed), I find that it applies equally
                    to arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It should be emphasised that an issue need not
                    be addressed expressly in an award; it may be implicitly resolved. Resolving an
                    issue does not have to entail navigating through all the arguments and evidence.
                    If the outcome of certain issues flows from the conclusion of a specific
                    logically prior issue, the arbitral tribunal may dispense with delving into the
                    merits of the arguments and evidence for the former. Using a claim in tort as an
                    example, if the arbitral tribunal has found that there is no duty of care, it
                    follows of course that there can be no breach of a duty of care and
                    consequently, damages. The arbitral tribunal is not obliged to pursue a moot
                    issue and consider the merits of either the standard of care or the claim for
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Arbitrator dealt with all the essential
                    issues. The dispute between the parties was over the purported repudiation of
                    the MOAs. The essential issues were therefore those which touch on whether
                    TMM’s actions amounted to a repudiation of the MOAs and if so, whether the
                    repudiation was justified. Hence, once the Arbitrator took the position that
                    PRM’s failures in respect of the repairs (if any) only amounted to a
                    breach of a warranty and not a condition, TMM was accordingly not entitled to
                    reject delivery of the Vessels. TMM’s rejection of the NOR and refusal to
                    take and complete delivery therefore amounted to a wrongful repudiation of the
                    MOAs. Thus, the essential issues were addressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Although TMM submitted the Arbitrator did not
                    deal with certain issues, the resolution of those issues flowed from his
                    decision on other issues. It was therefore not necessary for him to expressly
                    deal with those issues. It was not essential that the Arbitrator expressly
                    rendered a decision on the issues of whether PRM was obliged to (a) arrange for
                    ABS to issue a class certificate with DP-1 Class notation for the
                        Vessels,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    and (b) ensure that the DP system was functioning and operational.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> This is because he had
                    already found that the Vessels were sold “as is where is” and not
                    “by description”. In other words, because the Vessels did not have
                    DP-1 capabilities at the time of purchase, the operability of the DP-1 system
                    and its classification were inconsequential to TMM’s right to reject to
                    the NOR. In the Arbitrator’s view, the obligation to effect the repairs
                    listed in the Spreadsheets, including the DP-1 system, was not a condition. He
                    set out his explanations at, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    paragraphs 86, 99 and 117 of the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     TMM had one more arrow in its bow (see [37]
                    above). Ms Ang argued that the Arbitrator did not determine whether TMM had
                    evinced an unambiguous intention not to perform the MOAs which is the test for
                    repudiation. In my judgment, the Arbitrator <em>did</em>
                    deal with this issue. At paragraphs 119 to 123 of the Award, he explained that
                    TMM’s wrongful rejection of the NOR coupled with its failure to make funds
                    available to pay the balance 90% purchase price evinced an unequivocal intention
                    not to perform the MOAs. In his words, TMM “failed to prove they had the
                    wherewithal to honour their contractual obligations”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> To this, Mr Chan
                    and Ms Ang then argued that the Arbitrator did not explain how TMM’s
                    obligation to make funds available had arisen in the first place, thereby making
                    its failure to do so a repudiatory breach. Apparently, the complaint is that
                    TMM’s obligation to make funds available to complete the transaction had
                    not arisen at the point that the Arbitrator said it had repudiated the MOAs
                    because the deadline of 36 hours to tender the balance of the purchase price had
                    not passed. If TMM was not obliged to make payment at the time of its rejection
                    of the NOR, the fact that it did not do so cannot be evidence of repudiation.
                    That is how I understood Ms Ang and Mr Chan’s submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I struggled with this submission because it
                    was clear in the Award that the Arbitrator stated that the parties had <em>agreed</em> to pay the balance 90% purchase price into an
                    account with the Development Bank of Singapore
                        (“DBS”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Mr Chan protested that the
                    Arbitrator was simply reciting facts and not making any finding. When I
                    suggested that the language used by the Arbitrator was more imperative rather
                    than descriptive, Mr Chan then said that the Arbitrator’s statement did
                    not amount to a finding of an obligation as “it only says an
                        agreement.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> With respect, this submission is
                    difficult to follow. The Arbitrator’s statement was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    As to the payment of the 90% of the purchase
                            price, the Claimants <em>agreed to place</em> the
                            funds in an escrow account with DBS Bank, Singapore, to whom the Vessels
                            were mortgaged. In fact, Mr. Angel Diaz, the point man and principal
                            representative of the Claimants, who was handling the purchase,
                                <em>personally attended</em> before the offices
                            of DBS Bank <em>to accomplish
                        this</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It is clear that the Arbitrator’s
                    statement was referring to cl 3 of the MOAs which states that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… 90% balance of the Purchase Price <em>shall be
                            paid</em> … to an account with the Seller’s nominated
                        bank …
                        <em>on the date of closing and delivery</em> of the
                        [Vessels] …
                        <em>but not later than 36 hours after the [Vessels are] in
                            every respect physically ready for delivery</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Arbitrator interpreted cl 3 of the MOAs as
                    requiring TMM to ensure the 90% of the purchase price was paid to PRM’s
                    account in DBS on the date of closing and delivery but no later than 36 hours
                    after the issuance of the NOR, <em>viz</em>, 28 October
                    (Mexican Time) or 29 October (Singapore Time). It is not disputed that TMM was
                    not going to place any funds with DBS because the allegedly remaining defective
                    items in the Spreadsheets were not fully repaired according to TMM. Until those
                    defective items were repaired, TMM was not going to make any payment. Since PRM
                    was taking the position that the requirements in Addendum No 1, and more
                    importantly the completion of the repairs in the Spreadsheets, were not a
                    condition for delivery and since PRM was also disputing whether the items were
                    defective as alleged, the on-going stalemate would necessarily result in no
                    funds being placed by TMM with DBS in any event, whether or not TMM was minded
                    to wait out the 36 hours or longer, after receiving a rejection of its NOR. In
                    short, from the perspective of PRM, TMM was never going pay the balance of 90%
                    of the purchase price based on the NOR as issued and TMM was clearly refusing to
                    take delivery. As a matter of fact, no funds were parked in PRM’s DBS
                    account at any time within that material window. In that context, and without
                    descending into the merits of the Arbitrator’s construction of the payment
                    obligation in the MOAs which appears to be of a type which is fairly standard in
                    the industry (see Iain Goldrein QC <em>et al</em>,
                        <em>Ship Sale and Purchase</em> (Informa, 6th Ed, 2012)
                    at para 5.17.1), it seems incongruous that TMM could argue there was no
                    operative payment obligation which the Arbitrator could have pegged his
                    conclusion of repudiatory breach onto. Parenthetically, it bears noting that in
                    its closing submissions in the Arbitration, TMM had actually stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, if which is denied, the NOD was a valid notice of
                        readiness, the Claimants [TMM] <em>would be required to make
                            payment under Clause 3 of the MOAs within 36 hours</em>. If they
                        did not do so within this time, they would be in breach. As the NOD was
                        given on 28 October 2008 at 1806hrs (Mexico Time), the Claimants had until
                        0606hrs on 30 October 2008 (Mexico Time) <em>to make payment
                            before the Claimants [TMM] would be in breach</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     To close the loop, TMM also argued that it
                    refused to make payment pending its request for the repairs to be completed
                        <em>first</em> because it would otherwise lose interest
                    on funds parked in a suspense account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>
                    TMM’s position was that the Arbitrator had completely ignored this in his
                    conclusion. I do not agree. The Arbitrator construed the agreement as imposing a
                    “strict obligation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> on TMM to ensure that funds were
                    transferred into PRM’s DBS account. Accordingly, the reasons why TMM did
                    not make funds available within 36 hours of the presentation of the NOR, or the
                    fact that it had funds available elsewhere which TMM said showed that it had the
                    wherewithal to complete the transaction, are beside the point. The Arbitrator
                    found that no funds were made available within the requisite window as required
                    by cl 3 of the MOAs. This led the Arbitrator to then conclude that TMM had
                    displayed an intention to repudiate the MOAs. It should also be mentioned that
                    cl 13 of the MOAs states that “should the Purchase Price not be paid in
                    accordance with Clause 3, the Sellers have the right to cancel the Agreement
                    …”.</p>

                            appreciate the approach that Your Honour is taking and where you are
                            coming from which I think goes to the heart of the issues in this case
                                <em>whether or not the vessel was in fact ready for
                                delivery at that time and whether or not the notice of rejection of
                                the delivery was justified or not justified and whether or not the
                                action in rejecting the notice of delivery was a repudiatory breach.
                                That is the key point which the Tribunal did not consider.
                                </em><b><em>He just jumped to the conclusion
                                that’s it’s a condition – it’s not a
                                condition precedent and therefore you cannot reject a notice of
                                delivery</em></b>. <b><em>And if you follow that line
                                or argument, then in no case can a buyer reject a notice of delivery
                                because it’s never a condition precedent. So in every case
                                when buyer were to do that, he immediately runs the risk of
                                repudiating the contract which the cases and the authority showed is
                                wrong. It’s not the position in law.</em></b> But more
                            critically following through from that, the last issue which the
                            Arbitrator had to consider is, even if he was right that the defects, as
                            you say, were all remedied at the time, did our action in setting out
                            our rejection of the notice of delivery where we identified all the
                            things that we thought were not completed and, in particular, we did
                            mention the DP system although contrary to my learned friend’s
                            point that we didn’t, whether we were justified in rejecting the
                            notice of delivery and if there was justification, whether that conduct
                            amounted to a repudiatory breach in law? <em>And
                                that’s the whole area that the Tribunal failed to – to
                                consider. And in order to consider whether that action was
                                repudiatory, the background facts are critical, Your Honour.
                                </em><b><em>The background
                                circumstances</em></b><em>, both vis-a-vis the
                                buyers and the project that they bid for, the buyers and the steps
                                they were taking towards completion of the delivery of the vessel
                                are critical because it </em><b><em>shows that we
                                were not repudiating the contract</em></b>. We were actually
                            taking steps to complete it <b><em>but for the fact
                                </em></b><b>that there were these
                                defects</b> and the defects are very clear from the evidence
                            of the – the sellers themselves, not even our evidence, their own
                            evidence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So there were many things which the Tribunal ignored which is why we
                            said the Tribunal only chose to come to – how we say it is the
                            Tribunal had already made up its mind that because of the financial
                            crisis, we were not going to perform this contract and therefore the
                            arguments in this award was tailored towards justifying that conclusion.
                            But he failed to consider very critically on that score as well that,
                            financially, the buyers had the wherewithal to purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Even if the Arbitrator had misapplied the law
                    on repudiatory breach, that does not justify setting aside the Award. It cannot
                    be the law that every time there is an error of law, the arbitral tribunal must
                    be taken to have ignored the submissions of the party which is relying on that
                    error. In any event, for reasons which I shall elaborate on (see [94]–[96]
                    below), it is also not accurate for TMM to claim that the Arbitrator did not
                    consider whether TMM’s actions and conduct amounted to a repudiatory
                    breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     For the above reasons, I cannot agree with Ms
                    Ang’s submission that the essential issues were not
                addressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty to attempt to understand submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The relevant authority cited to me by TMM on
                    this point is Andrew Ang J’s decision in <em>Front Row
                        Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 80 (“<em>Front
                        Row</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The gist of the
                    plaintiff’s case in <em>Front Row</em> was that the
                    arbitrator had disregarded its case by ignoring two representations in its
                    counterclaim for misrepresentation in the arbitration. The arbitrator had
                    disregarded the representations as he took the view that the plaintiff had
                    abandoned reliance on the two representations by the close of its case, a
                    finding which the plaintiff characterised as “inexplicable”. After
                    perusing the pleadings and submissions, Ang J agreed with the plaintiff that it
                    had not abandoned the representations. The arbitrator was therefore in breach of
                    the <em>audi alteram partem</em> rule by dismissing the
                    counterclaim without considering the plaintiff’s arguments on the other
                    representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In arriving at his decision, Ang J found
                    attractive a series of Australian decisions on building adjudication which
                    proposed that natural justice requires the adjudicator to “attempt to
                    understand and address the issues”; “[endeavour] to understand and
                    deal with the issues”: see <em>Timwin Construction v
                        Façade Innovations</em> [2005] NSWSC 548; and <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v Davenport</em> [2004] NSWCA 394. I have no
                    difficulty agreeing with the proposition that to ensure that the right to be
                    heard is effectively safeguarded, an arbitral tribunal must demonstrably have at
                    least attempted to comprehend the parties’ arguments on the essential
                    issues. However, it is also clear that the inquiry should not be side-tracked by
                    the explicability of a decision <em>alone</em>. The
                    inexplicability of the decision is only one factor which goes towards proving
                    that the arbitral tribunal did not in fact properly attempt to consider or
                    comprehend the parties’ arguments. As Ang J ultimately concluded in
                        <em>Front Row</em> at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he court will look at the <em>face of the
                            documents</em> and the tribunal’s decision to determine
                        whether the tribunal has in fact fulfilled its duty to <em>apply its mind</em> to the issues placed by the parties before it
                        and <em>considered the arguments</em> raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Indeed, the central inquiry in all such cases
                    is whether the award reflects the fact that the arbitral tribunal had applied
                    its mind to the critical issues and arguments. Ang J set aside part of the award
                    because he was not persuaded that the arbitrator had “had regard to the
                    submissions of parties and the material before him in arriving at his
                    decision”: <em>Front Row</em> at [45]. <em>Front Row</em> does not stand for the proposition that a
                    decision which is inexplicable is evidence that the arbitral tribunal had
                    necessarily not applied its mind to the parties’ submissions. The general
                    principle that errors of law do not found a basis for challenging an award would
                    also be denuded of any significant meaning if the court is too fixated with the
                    explicability of a decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     An assessment of whether the arbitral tribunal
                    had attempted to understand the parties’ submissions is effectively an
                    investigation into the inner workings of the respective arbitrator’s
                    minds. Ostensibly, the arbitral tribunal may, after applying its mind, fail to
                    comprehend the submissions or comprehended them erroneously, and thereby come to
                    a decision which may fall to be characterised as inexplicable. In my view, such
                    a situation falls short of a breach of the rules of natural justice,
                    particularly when one is cognisant of the diverse types of arbitrators that may
                    be appointed by parties (see [47] above). There is no clear bright line
                    separating a decision which was made without any attempt to understand a
                    party’s submissions on the one hand, and a decision which was made with a
                    concentrated attempt which proved futile or ineffective not because of a want of
                    desire to understand on the part of the arbitrator on the other. In the
                    difficult cases, any distinction which can be drawn will invariably be very
                    fine. Hence, it is usually not profitable to refer to the <em>outcome</em> of other court decisions as supportive
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     TMM claimed that the Arbitrator had not tried
                    to understand its arguments as evidenced by his apparent confusion and
                    conflation of the rejection of the NOR with the repudiation of the
                        MOAs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> According to TMM, if the Arbitrator had
                    tried to understand TMM’s arguments, he would have realised that
                    TMM’s case was that it was rejecting the NOR, and not terminating the
                    MOAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     With respect, I am unable to see the logic of
                    this submission. In the first place, the facts do not support the distinction
                    which TMM has drawn. In the email exchanges between the parties at the relevant
                    time of issuance and subsequent rejection of the NOR (see [11]–[16]
                    above), it was clear that TMM’s primary if not sole reason for rejecting
                    the NOR and not taking delivery was its insistence on receipt of evidence that
                    the items in the Spreadsheets were repaired. With PRM insisting that the repairs
                    were not a condition precedent to the issuance of a NOR and that in any event
                    those repairs were completed, if TMM did not want to give the impression that it
                    was stonewalling and did not intend to carry on with the MOAs, it could have
                    accepted delivery of the Vessels and claimed damages if the repairs were indeed
                    incomplete. Instead, it took the position then that on a proper construction of
                    the MOAs with the respective Addendum No 1, the items in the Spreadsheets must
                    be repaired before the Vessels could be said to be physically ready in every
                    respect in accordance with cl 5 of the MOA. In these circumstances, the
                    Arbitrator’s view that TMM’s continued refusal to accept delivery
                    amounted to a repudiation of the MOAs is not inexplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Furthermore, to say that the Arbitrator
                        <em>ought</em> to have appreciated the distinction
                    which TMM made had he tried to understand TMM’s case, a failure of which
                    amounts to failing to attempt to understand TMM’s submissions, is
                    essentially to force the Arbitrator to accept – and not just consider or
                    comprehend – its argument. That goes far beyond the test in <em>Front Row</em> which only requires the arbitral tribunal to
                    have applied its mind to the submissions. It is also very different from saying
                    that the Arbitrator had not invested the requisite effort to consider
                    TMM’s submissions in arriving at his decision. No party has a right to
                    expect the arbitral tribunal to accept its arguments, regardless of how strong
                    and credible it perceives its own arguments to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The Arbitrator was entitled to hold that by
                    wrongfully rejecting the NOR and insisting that the completion of repairs is a
                    condition precedent to the issuance of a valid NOR, and not having made the
                    requisite funds available to complete the sale, TMM had demonstrated its
                    intention to repudiate the MOAs. While TMM is entitled to draw the distinction
                    between rejecting the NOR and <em>not</em> repudiating the
                    MOAs for tactical reasons, that does not foreclose the Arbitrator from
                    continuing with the natural path of the analysis after finding that TMM had
                    wrongfully rejected the NOR, particularly since the issue of whether TMM had
                    committed a repudiatory breach was explicitly listed in the MOI. Indeed, it is
                    unfathomable that the Arbitrator would have taken the approach and analysis
                    which he did if he had not applied his mind to the essential issues and
                    TMM’s submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Natural justice only protects the
                    parties’ right to be heard. It is an important right that arbitral
                    tribunals must respect diligently and which the courts will protect
                    unreservedly. However, that right does not extend to functioning as a guarantee
                    that the arbitral tribunal <em>will</em> comprehend or
                    appreciate the parties’ submissions <em>and</em>
                    endorse the reasonableness, cogency and appeal of any party’s arguments.
                    In so far as that is how I understood TMM’s case, I reject the claim that
                    the Arbitrator had failed to attempt to understand TMM’s
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty to give reasons and explanations</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The law </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The arbitral tribunal is generally bound to
                    give reasons for its decision. This is provided for in Art 31(2) of the Model
                    Law. However, Art 31(2) is silent on the content of this duty. The <em>travaux</em> <em>préparatoires</em>
                    to the Model Law too contain minimal elaboration (see <em>Analytical Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International
                        Commercial Arbitration: Report of the Secretary General</em> (25 March
                    1985) (A/CN.9/264) at pp 65–67; and <em>Report of the

                    251–252. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that failure to give reasons
                    would be a breach of Art 31(2) and may render the award liable to be set aside
                    or enforcement may be refused on the grounds that it was not in accordance with
                    the arbitral procedure or public policy: Peter Binder, <em>International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law

                    16.9.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     As far as I am aware, there is no authority in
                    Singapore which directly touches on the scope of an arbitral tribunal’s
                    duty to give reasons and explain its decision. There is a suggestion in the High
                    Court decision of <em>Prestige Marine Services Pte Ltd v Marubeni
                        International Petroleum (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2012] 1 SLR 917 at [39] that
                    the inadequate provision of reasons by an arbitral tribunal is a mere error of
                    law. I agree with that suggestion and would go on to add that given that it is
                    trite that the court normally does not intervene in an award under the IAA on
                    the basis of errors of law <em>per se</em>, it must follow
                    that an allegation of inadequate reasons and explanations is therefore generally
                    not capable of sustaining a challenge against an award. This is so even if one
                    characterises inadequacy of reasons and explanations as a breach of the rules of
                    natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     That said, it is obvious that the very concept
                    of adequacy carries with it the idea of a spectrum. On one end resides awards
                    which have no reasons; such awards would be in breach of Art 31(2) of the Model
                    Law and are extremely vulnerable to challenges. Awards at the other end will
                    have comprehensive and cogent reasons. Attempts to challenge these awards on the
                    basis of natural justice are almost certain to fail. Most awards fall in the
                    middle of this spectrum. Viewed in this light, it should be apparent that whilst
                    awards with the barest of reasons can be argued as merely having inadequate
                    reasons, they might not be safe from impeachment. The question thus is this: how
                    much reasons and explanations are required after which any further criticism of
                    inadequate reasons and explanation will not warrant curial
                intervention?</p>

                    422, an issue arose as to whether the arbitral tribunal dealt with the arguments
                    and evidence adequately. While recognising that there is a duty to give reasons,
                    Colman J said (at [8]–[9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    … [Arbitrators] are under no duty to deal

                            arrive at a conclusion of fact expressly on the basis of evidence that
                            was before them does not call for clarification for it is unambiguously
                            clear that they have given more weight to that evidence than to other
                            evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    In this connection, it is <em>clear

                    [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 130 (“<em>Bremer</em>”), Donaldson LJ said (at 132–133):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All that is necessary is that the arbitrators should set out what, on

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    This was echoed by Thomas J in <em>Hussman</em> who held (at [56]) that arbitrators are not

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The Singapore Court of Appeal’s
                    decision in <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 676 (“<em>Thong Ah Fat</em>”)
                    which sets out the scope and content of the <em>court’s</em> duty to give reasons offers, in my view, an
                    instructive parallel. I note in passing that Professor Jeffrey Waincymer
                    suggests that it is unhelpful to define the content of arbitrators’ duty
                    to give reasons by reference to judicial standards: <em>Waincymer</em> at para 16.9.3. In support of his view, he referred to
                    the High Court of Australia decision of <em>Westport Insurance
                        Corporation &amp; Ors v Gordian Runoff Limited</em> [2011] HCA 37
                    where Kiefel J stated (at [168]–[169]) that there is nothing in the
                    relevant Australian legislation, the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984, which
                    stipulates that the <em>standard</em> for giving reasons in
                    arbitration should be the same as the judicial standard. The same is true of the
                    IAA but as the court in <em>Thong Ah Fat</em> held (at
                    [19]), the general duty of a judicial body to explain its decision is
                    ineluctably “a function of due process, and therefore of justice”.
                    While there are structural differences between a court and an arbitral tribunal,
                    it cannot be gainsaid that arbitrations are subject to the same ideals of due
                    process and justice. It bears mentioning that Kiefel J concluded that the
                    requirement to give a reasoned award cannot be devoid of content and for that
                    reason, he was content to adopt Donaldson LJ’s statement in <em>Bremer</em> (see [101] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Therefore, in my view, the standards
                    applicable to judges are assistive indicia to arbitrators. While the rules of
                    natural justice must be applied rigorously in arbitrations as they are in court
                    litigation, the practical realities of the arbitral ecosystem such as promptness
                    and price are also important (see <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at
                    [63]). On this note, the following are clear from <em>Thong Ah
                        Fat</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     The standard of explanation
                        required in every case must correspond to the requirements of the case.
                        Costs and delays are relevant factors to consider when determining the
                        extent to which reasons and explanations are to be set out in detail: at
                        [29]–[30].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     In “very clear cases” with specific and straightforward
                        factual or legal issues, the court may even dispense with reasons. Its
                        conclusion will be sufficient because the reasons behind the conclusion are
                        a matter of necessary inference: at [32].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     Decisions or findings which do not bear
                        directly on the substance of the dispute or affect the final resolution of
                        the parties’ rights may not require detailed reasoning. As a rule of
                        thumb, the more profound the consequences of a specific decision, the
                        greater the necessity for detailed reasoning: at [33].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     There should be a summary of all the
                        key relevant evidence but not all the detailed evidence needs to be referred
                        to: at [34].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_e"></a>(e)     The parties’ opposing stance and the judge’s findings of fact
                        on the material issues should be set out. However, the judge does not have
                        to make an explicit ruling on each and every factual issue: at
                        [35]–[36].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_f"></a>(f)     The decision should demonstrate an examination of the relevant
                        evidence and the facts found with a view to explaining the final outcome on
                        each material issue: at [36].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Even if some of an arbitral tribunal’s
                    conclusions are bereft of reasons, that is not necessarily fatal. There are a
                    variety reasons why an arbitral tribunal may elect not to say something. In my
                    view, the crux is whether the contents of the arbitral award taken as a whole
                    inform the parties of the bases on which the arbitral tribunal reached its
                    decision on the material or essential issues: <em>Egil Trust Co
                        Ltd v Pigott-Brown</em> [1985] 3 All ER 119 at 122. In this regard, I
                    agree fully with Prakash J’s following observation in <em>SEF</em> at [60]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the [Adjudicator] did not feel it necessary to discuss his
                        reasoning and explicitly state his conclusions in relation to the third and
                        fourth jurisdictional issues, though unfortunate in that it gave rise to
                        fears on the part of SEF that is points were not thought about, cannot mean
                        that he did not have regard to those submissions at all. It may have been an
                        accidental omission on his part to indicate expressly why he was rejecting
                        the submissions since the Adjudicator took care to explain the reasons for
                        his other determinations and even indicated matters on which he was not
                        making a determination. Alternatively, he may have found the points so
                        unconvincing that he thought it was not necessary to explicitly state his
                        findings. Whatever may be the reason for the Adjudicator’s omission in
                        this respect, I do not consider that SEF was not afforded natural
                        justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    There is plainly no requirement for the
                    arbitral tribunal to touch on “each and every point in dispute” in
                    its grounds of decision: <em>Checkpoint Ltd v Strathclyde Pension
                        Fund</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 84 at [48]. Last but not least, it bears
                    repeating that as guided by <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>,
                    decisions or findings which do not bear directly on the substance of the dispute
                    or affect the final resolution of the parties’ rights may not require
                    detailed reasoning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The complaints under this sub-rule form the
                    principal thrust of TMM’s case. At the outset, I do not agree with Mr
                    Ajaib’s argument that it is sufficient to meet the rigours of this
                    sub-rule if the arbitral tribunal merely states in its award that it had
                    considered both parties’ submissions and evidence, as the Arbitrator did.
                    The court will not allow itself to be side-tracked by such superficialities.
                    However, the Arbitrator did more than that. He summarised the relevant facts and
                    evidence relating to the material issue,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span><em>viz</em>, whether the NOR was wrongfully rejected by
                    TMM; crystallised the parties’ cases on that key issue;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> and
                    thereafter set out his conclusions on the construction of the Spreadsheets, the
                    MOAs, and the merits of TMM’s reliance on a purported breach of cl 11 to
                    reject the NOR.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> In so doing, the Arbitrator
                    has crossed the minimum standard for giving reasons and explanations which is
                    expected of an arbitral tribunal. While the Arbitrator could have given more
                    reasons by, for example, dissecting the evidence in greater detail; explaining
                    why he preferred one version of events or one witness to another; or explaining
                    why he chose to omit discussion of certain facts, the fact that he did not do
                    any or even all of these must be taken in the round and in the context of an
                    award which has already addressed the key issues. At best, TMM’s claims
                    amount to “a criticism of the reasoning, but it is no more than
                    that”: see <em>Hussman</em> at [57].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Most of TMM’s arguments target the
                    absence of any mention of specific evidence raised by TMM. It is in that sense
                    that TMM argued that the Arbitrator had failed to give reasons or provide a
                    proper explanation as to why he had omitted to mention those pieces of evidence.
                    For instance, TMM alleged that the Arbitrator did not refer to any of
                    TMM’s evidence when he was ascertaining TMM’s financial ability and
                    means to complete the purchase. TMM also complained that the Arbitrator ignored
                    TMM’s evidence that the Vessels were not repaired at the time of the
                    issuance of the NOR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    On whether TMM could have completed the
                    purchase, the Arbitrator stated that he accepted the testimony of PRM’s
                    witness who said that he was informed by the principal representative of TMM in
                    the transaction that TMM were unable to complete the purchase because TMM had
                    been adversely impacted by the financial crisis in 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> On whether the
                    repairs were effected, the Arbitrator had arrived at his conclusion by relying
                    on documentary evidence. In his view, the ABS Surveys showed that the repairs
                    had been effected,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> and that was sufficient for his purposes.
                    Therefore, contrary to TMM’s submissions, the Arbitrator did in fact give
                    reasons for his various conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Whatever may be said about the justification
                    for the Arbitrator’s preference for a particular piece of evidence is
                    strictly irrelevant; the court does not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the
                    rightness or wrongness of a substantive decision of the arbitral tribunal in
                    setting aside proceedings under the IAA. The danger of accepting TMM’s
                    case is exemplified when the case is brought to its logical extreme. There will
                    be a challengeable deficit of reasons and explanations in most if not all
                    arbitral awards because counsel can always come up with a further
                    “why” question to any reason given for a conclusion. For instance,
                    even if the arbitral tribunal states in its award that it considered a specific
                    witness more credible than another because of their respective demeanour and
                    confidence when responding to questions, it may then be queried in what way the
                    former’s demeanour and confidence was more persuasive than the latter;
                    even if that were the case, why does that justify believing the former’s
                    evidence over the latter; did the arbitral tribunal compare and weigh the
                    documentary evidence against the oral testimony, and if not, why not; and so on
                    and so forth. Judging from the drift of TMM’s arguments generally, it
                    would be surprising if it simply accepted a reason such as one witness appearing
                    more credible than another in terms of demeanour. Therefore, accepting
                    TMM’s arguments here would not only do violence to the scheme of the IAA
                    and the Model Law which do not countenance such intrusions (see <em>Tjong</em> at [29]), it would also encourage counsel to do
                    precisely what Bingham J in <em>Zermalt</em> cautioned
                    courts against doing, <em>viz</em> casting a meticulous
                    legal eye and endeavouring to pick holes, inconsistencies and faults in awards
                    (see [45] above). The IAA and the Model Law should not be so
                exploited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Unpacked, TMM’s complaints about the
                    absence of any references to its arguments and evidence in the Award are, in
                    substance, complaints that the Arbitrator <em>should</em>
                    not have drawn certain factual inferences (see [29(b)]–[29(f)] above). The
                    nature of the bulk of TMM’s submissions is self-evident:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    At its highest, TMM’s case is
                    basically that the Arbitrator had erred in his findings of fact and/or law which
                    TMM knew does not found a basis for challenge under the IAA and which was why it
                    had to couch its case as a breach of natural justice. This was not a genuine
                    case of the Arbitrator failing to provide sufficient explanations. As was
                    evidenced in its own submissions above, TMM in fact highlighted some of the
                    reasons given by the Arbitrator for his decision. TMM even noted that it was
                        “implied”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> from the Arbitrator’s reasoning that
                    the NOR must have been valid. If TMM could gather the Arbitrator’s
                    reasoning from the Award, it cannot be open to them to argue at the same time
                    that it is unclear how the Arbitrator arrived at his decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    There was a point in the oral arguments
                    where counsel were arguing over the Arbitrator’s findings that the repairs
                    on the FiFi pump were completed. Ms Ang stated that there was evidence such as
                    certain reports which suggested that the FiFi pump was not working.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Mr Ajaib then repeated several
                    times that the ABS Surveys had certified that the FiFi pumps were in order, to
                    which Ms Ang then insisted, without showing any evidence, that the ABS surveyor
                    who had inspected the Vessels did not test the FiFi pumps.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Such exchanges were not uncommon, and in my
                    view, symptomatic of the case which TMM was running, <em>viz</em>, that the Arbitrator <em>should</em>
                    not have made the inferences which he did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The consistent theme in TMM’s case,
                    namely, that the Arbitrator “simply [accepted] the ABS certificate and
                    [ignored] all the other evidence showing that the [Vessels] were in fact not
                    physically ready”, is not indicative of the lack of reasons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the Arbitrator had explained why he
                    chose the ABS Surveys as the yardstick for assessing the state of the
                        repairs:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There must be some objective criteria which qualify them as such vessels.

                        or Respondent would make that determination. ABS Surveyed the Vessels and
                        certified them to be fit and functioning. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Such completion [of the repairs] is to be determined not by the
                        subjective judgment of the Claimants and their representatives but by
                        independent evidence. Applying the objective standard, the Tribunal
                        concludes without hesitation that the Respondents did complete and
                        accomplish all the repairs before 28 October 2008. In doing this, the
                        Tribunal accepts the report of ABS as objective and unbiased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    I must stress that I am not judging the
                    quality of TMM’s arguments in the Arbitration. Perhaps the Arbitrator
                    could have accorded more weight to the countervailing evidence when determining
                    the reliability of the ABS Surveys, including whether the ABS Surveys could be
                    relied upon to reflect the state of affairs on a date preceding the date of the
                    ABS survey certificates. However, balanced against that is the principle that
                    the arbitral tribunal generally has wide prerogative and autonomy to evaluate
                    the available competing evidence and arrive at its conclusion. It may even make
                    findings of fact which differ from the facts which either party contended for:

                        Limited</em> [2007] EWHC 1799 (TCC) at [37]. That is buttressed
                    further by the established principle which is binding upon me that errors of law
                    and fact <em>per se</em> are final and binding on the
                    parties and an award containing such errors may not be appealed against or set
                    aside by a court unless they <em>independently</em> engage
                    a ground expressly prescribed under s 24 of the IAA and/or Art 34(2) of the
                    Model Law: <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank

                    Prakash J applied this principle (at [38]) and held that the plaintiff’s
                    allegation that the arbitral tribunal had ignored certain facts amounted to an
                    “error of fact, in respect of which there is also no remedy under the
                    [IAA].”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Even if TMM was right in that the evidence
                    overwhelmingly pointed to the repairs not being completed and that the ABS

                    evidenced a <em>prima facie</em> breach of the rules of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whether the breach of natural justice was merely technical and
                        inconsequential or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was
                        denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a
                        fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations. Put another
                        way, the issue is whether the material could reasonably have
                        made a difference to the arbitrator; rather than whether it would
                        necessarily have done so. Where it is evident that there is no prospect
                        whatsoever that the material if presented would have made any difference
                        because it wholly lacked any legal or factual weight, then it could not
                        seriously be said that the complainant has suffered actual or real prejudice
                        in not having had the opportunity to present this to the arbitrator
                            (cf <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [86])</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Applying this test, even if the Arbitrator
                    had found that the repairs had not been completed, it would probably not have
                    made a difference to his deliberation on the outcome. The Arbitrator would, in
                    all likelihood, have maintained his view that TMM ought not to have rejected the
                    NOR because the obligation to repair the items in the Spreadsheets only had the
                    effect of a warranty for which a breach would only sound in damages. The
                    Arbitrator alluded to this when he said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>

                    which surfaced in the course of oral arguments which I shall mention briefly. In
                    a nutshell, Mr Chan suggested that there may be cases where decisions premised
                    on findings of fact made without <em>any</em> evidential
                    basis, <em>ie</em> no rationally probative evidence capable
                    of supporting the findings, are liable to be set aside for breach of natural
                    justice. He did not cite any authority but there appears to be some recognition
                    of this “no evidence” rule falling under the umbrella of natural
                    justice in Australia and New Zealand, both of which are jurisdictions which

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    As far as I am aware, this “no
                    evidence” rule has yet to be argued fully before a Singapore court, much
                    less accepted as part of Singapore law. Mr Ajaib’s position was somewhat
                    ambivalent. At one point he candidly accepted that the “no
                    evidence” rule might come within the ground of natural
                        justice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> On another occasion,
                    citing <em>Sui Southern</em>, Mr Ajaib said that a finding
                    of fact which is unsupported by any evidence might be an egregious error, but is
                    not one that invites curial intervention under the IAA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> As the law on this point was not argued fully
                    by counsel, I shall not express a view on whether TMM would have succeeded under
                    the “no evidence” rule if it forms part of Singapore
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    TMM might not have liked or agreed with the
                    way the Arbitrator construed the evidence and the law, but the bottom line is
                    that TMM evidently knew how and on what basis the Arbitrator arrived at his
                    decision. It also knew that the Arbitrator had preferred one version of events
                    and evidence to another. To look at it another way, TMM’s dissatisfaction
                    was not that it was not heard, but that it was not believed. No party to an
                    arbitration has a right to have its <em>evidence</em>
                    believed, just as no party has a right to have its <em>submissions</em> comprehended and consequently accepted (see
                    [94]–[96] above). TMM and PRM contracted and bargained for the
                    Arbitrator’s expertise and adjudicatory abilities – including his
                    evaluative faculties – when they chose arbitration and appointed him. TMM
                    might be unhappy with the outcome of the application of his faculties, but it
                    got what it bargained for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In summary, for the reasons stated above,
                    the facts do not disclose breaches of the rules of natural justice, much less an
                    actual or real prejudice to TMM arising from the alleged breaches. I find that
                    the Arbitrator did have regard and applied his mind to TMM’s submissions,
                    dealt with the essential issues generated by the dispute, and gave and explained
                    his reasons adequately in the Award. There was also no excess of jurisdiction
                    which resulted in a deprivation of TMM’s right to be heard. Holistically,
                    applying the general overarching guiding consideration in <em>Rotoaira</em> (see [64] above), a reasonable party in the shoes of
                    TMM would have foreseen the possibility of the reasoning of the type revealed
                    the Award. It was therefore not entitled to complain about it now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Apparent bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Given that TMM’s arguments on apparent
                    bias were mostly built upon the same premises as its arguments on the right to
                    be heard, the factual premises on which TMM mounted its apparent bias claim are
                    consequently unsustainable. I should however address one point on the issue of
                    apparent bias. The test for apparent bias is whether the circumstances gave rise
                    to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person
                    with knowledge of the relevant facts that the arbitral tribunal was biased
                        (<em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 85 at [91]). TMM expressly prefaced its submissions with the
                    qualification that it was not relying on the Arbitrator’s errors <em>per se</em> to establish apparent bias. Instead, without
                    citing any authority, TMM sought to argue that the “egregious errors of
                    law and fact” from such an experienced arbitrator like the Arbitrator
                    invited a reasonable person to develop a reasonable suspicion that he was
                        biased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Even if TMM had
                    cited authorities, I would be slow to find in favour of its submission for
                    several reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    First, the egregious errors which TMM is
                    relying on are differences in interpretation of the law, assessment of the
                    evidence and the like. Reasonable people can take different – sometimes
                    even diametrically opposing – views. It would be a remarkable principle
                    and precedent to set if an adjudicator is deemed to be apparently biased just
                    because he or she takes to the law and the facts in a peculiar way. Second, even
                    if an arbitrator has utterly misapplied the law or misunderstood the facts, that
                    will not suffice even as <em>prima facie</em> evidence that
                    the arbitrator was apparently biased. Inexperienced adjudicators do not have a
                    monopoly over the making of mistakes of fact or law; even the most experienced
                    adjudicators are fallible. Third, words and expressions often have a penumbral
                    meaning. Thus, the exercise of interpreting the meaning of what was said or
                    written – whether in the form of witness testimonies, documentary
                    evidence, or propositions in case law and statutes – will invariably have
                    an element of subjectivity. The same goes for the interpretation of conduct and
                    actions. To add to that, as Lord Hoffmann observed in <em>Piglowska v Piglowski</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1360 at 1372, findings of
                    fact are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… inherently an incomplete statement of the impression which was
                        made upon [the judge] by the primary evidence. His expressed findings are
                        always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative
                        weight, minor qualification and nuance … of which time and language
                        do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the
                        judge’s overall evaluation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    For all these reasons, I hesitate to agree
                    with TMM’s suggestion that a reasonable person will labour under the
                    conception that an (experienced) adjudicator who takes a completely contrary
                    position from one party is predisposed to finding against that party and
                    therefore apparently biased. On TMM’s best case, the Arbitrator committed
                    certain errors of fact and law. TMM may lament that higher standards are usually
                    expected of an experienced arbitrator of the Arbitrator’s calibre. But
                    that is all it can do. It was given full opportunity to present its case. The
                    Arbitrator heard its case and delivered his verdict with supporting reasons. I
                    am not convinced that TMM has made out a case for apparent bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Arbitrations are meant to be an efficient
                    alternative to court litigation. This has, unfortunately, not been the case. In
                    these proceedings, TMM provided a compendious record of the Arbitration by way
                    of two affidavits which ran into about 3,200 pages across eight volumes.
                    Excluding oral submissions captured in more than 1,300 pages of transcripts, TMM
                    also tendered several rounds of written submissions which totalled 241 pages
                    from cover to cover. I find this to be both unnecessary and unsatisfactory.
                    Especially for challenges against an award founded on the breach of natural
                    justice, the court’s role is, in very general terms, to ensure that
                    missteps, if any, are more than arid, hollow, technical and procedural
                        (<em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [98]). Any real and
                    substantial cause for concern should be demonstrably clear on the face of the
                    record without the need to pore over thousands of pages of facts and
                    submissions. Otherwise, curial recourse against an award will be used (and
                    abused) as an opportunity to invite the court to judge the full merits and
                    conduct of the arbitration. As a further aside, an over-zealous scrutiny of the
                    arbitral tribunal’s decision will also encourage parties to, via the
                    statutorily permitted mechanism of curial recourse, tactically frustrate and
                    delay the enforcement of the arbitral award. In the present case, taking the
                    commencement of the Arbitration as the date at which the dispute arose, the
                    parties’ dispute is already in its fifth year. If my decision is appealed,
                    parties may well have to wait for several more months to finally resolve this
                    dispute. This runs contrary to one of the original aims of arbitration as an
                    expedient alternative dispute resolution mechanism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    TMM’s application to set aside the
                    Award is therefore dismissed. The Registry will fix a date for the hearing on
                    costs.</p>
