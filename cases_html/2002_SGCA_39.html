<p xmlns="">  Assistant Registrar gave judgment in favour of the appellants in the sum of $ 72,150.61.

  The respondents appealed against this judgment to the High Court. According to the

  respondents, the correct position was that a sum of $1,748,624.65 was due to them. The

  trial judge allowed the appeal and held that the appellants should pay the respondents the

  sum of $ 1,748,624.65. The appellants then commenced the present appeal seeking to restore

  the order of the Assistant Registrar. The appellants’ main contention was that in

  determining what was owing between the parties, no account should be taken of the full

  contract sum since the respondents had not completed their works under the sub-contract.</p>
<b xmlns=""><p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal,

  <p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)        A basic principle in

  contract law, based on the concept of <i>restituo in integram</i>, is that an aggrieved

  party is entitled to claim as damages the losses or additional expenses which he has to

  incur to get what he has contracted to obtain from the party and not to give him any gain

  beyond such loss. To determine the loss which the appellants had suffered on account of

  the stoppage of work by the respondents, it was only that portion exceeding the contract

  sum which the appellants had incurred (if any) to complete the works that the appellants

  would be entitled to claim as damages. In the circumstances of the present case, taking

  into account the amounts already paid to the respondents for works done, the expenses

  incurred by the appellants to complete the works and the amount obtained under the

  performance bond, there was a net sum of $1,748,624.65 due from the appellants to the

  respondents.</p>

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1        The action (Suit No. 46/1998) was

instituted by the respondent, New Civilbuild Pte Ltd (NCB), a sub-contractor of a

condominium project known as Tanglin Regency, to claim, inter alia, monies due under the

sub-contract. The defendant-appellant was Guobena Sendirian Bhd (Guobena), who was the

main contractor of the project. The sub-contract was for structural and architectural

works and its value was $16,413,047.88. This sum was increased to $16,800.732.03 for

agreed variations. 

<p xmlns="">2        There was a second defendant to the action,

Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd (Tai Ping), who had, at the request of NCB, issued a performance

bond for the sum of $1,642,045 in favour of Guobena as required under the sub-contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">3        The claim of NCB in the action was for the

payment of outstanding progress payments and the return of retention monies. In turn,

Guobena counter-claimed for, inter alia, damages for delay and non-compliance with the

sub-contract, which consisted of $5,702,309.41, being expenses incurred to complete the

project, and $3 million as liquidated damages for late completion.</p>
<p xmlns="">4        As a result of the dispute between NCB and

Guobena, the latter made a demand on the performance bond issued by Tai Ping. By

interlocutory proceedings, NCB sought unsuccessfully to restrain Guobena from calling on

the performance bond.</p>
<p xmlns="">5        At the conclusion of the action, the trial

judge on 29 February 2000 ruled that 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i)    NCB was entitled to progress claims No. 23 and 26

  and 50% of the retention monies, which in total amounted to $1,813,981.95;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii)    Guobena’s counterclaim for expenses

  incurred to complete the sub-contract works was allowed and the amount thereof was to be

  assessed by the Registrar.</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, Guobena’s counter-claim for liquidated damages was

disallowed by the trial judge who also ordered mutual set-offs from what was due to NCB

from Guobena and vice-versa. In the interim, Guobena was to retain the $1,642,045 which

Tai Ping had paid out under the performance bond (PB).</p>
<p xmlns="">6        The assessment of Guobena’s

counterclaim was carried out by the Assistant Registrar, who determined that the expenses

to be borne by NCB were $3,528,177.56. We should mention that this assessment was accepted

by both parties as neither had appealed against it. Accordingly, the Assistant Registrar

gave judgment in favour of Guobena in the sum of $72,150.61, arrived at as follows:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Counterclaim allowed

              $ 3,528,177.56</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Less</u>: money from PB

  <u>$(1,813,981.95)</u></p>
<p align="justify">Final balance due to Guobena <u>$     72,150.61</u></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">7        It was against this decision of the

Assistant Registrar that NCB appealed to the High Court. NCB submitted that the correct

position was that, in fact, a sum of $1,748,624.65 was due from Guobena to NCB. At the

hearing of that appeal, the trial judge allowed the appeal and held that Guobena should

pay the sum of $1,748,624.65 to NCB. The present appeal was Guobena’s further appeal

to us, seeking to restore the order of the Assistant Registrar. We dismissed the appeal

and now give our reasons.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appellant’s contention</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">8        The main argument raised by Guobena was

that, in determining what was due to NCB, after the mutual set-offs, no account should be

taken of the contract sum of $16,413,047.88 or the full contract sum of $16,800.732.03,

inclusive of the agreed variation.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Our decision</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">9        The following essential facts must be borne

in mind. The sub-contract value was originally $16,413,047.88 but it was increased by

agreed variations of $387,684.15, making it a total of $16,800,732.03. Up to the time NCB

commenced the action, NCB had received payment of $13,165,974.82. The judgment of 29

February 2000 awarding the sum of $1,813,981.95 to NCB was subject to set-off against any

sum found due to Guobena in the assessment of Guobena’s counter-claim for expenses

incurred to complete the works. The Assistant Registrar assessed the counter-claim at

$3,528,177.56. So, all in all, Guobena incurred $18,508,134.33 in completing the works.

But according to the contract, Guobena would only have to pay $16,800,732.03. The

difference of $1,707,402.30 was, therefore, the sum which Guobena was entitled to claim as

damages from NCB, who had terminated the works. Setting off this sum of $1,707,402.30

against the sum of $1,813,981.95 which the court adjudged being due from Guobena to NCB,

there was a balance of $106,579.65 due to NCB. Moreover, it would be recalled that Guobena

had called on the PB and had received the sum of $1,642,045. This should also be returned

to NCB. Adding these two sums would give a grand total of $1,748,624.65, which was what

Guobena should pay to NCB. </p>

</ol>
<p xmlns="">11        In our respectful opinion, the cause of

all the confusion would appear to stem from the argument of Guobena, that in determining

how the final accounts between the parties were to be computed, the contract sum should be

ignored. A basic principle of contract law is that an aggrieved party is entitled to claim

as damages the losses or additional expenses which he has to incur to get what he has

contracted to obtain from the party in breach. To make that determination, the price at

which the innocent party would have to pay under the contract must be reckoned.</p>
<p xmlns="">12        The point can, perhaps, be more readily

appreciated by a simple illustration. Say A employs B to do a piece of work for $100/-.

After three-quarters of the way and having been paid $75, B abandons work and A has to

engage others to complete it. A incurs $35/- to have the job done. On Guobena’s

argument, it will mean that A can claim the $35/- from B. This is obviously wrong. A, in

total, incurs $110/- ($75 plus $35). That is $10/- more than the contract sum. A can only

claim $10/- as damages and nothing more. If A were to be entitled to claim $35 as damages

from B, A would have benefitted because A would then have got the job done for only $75/-.

</p>
<p xmlns="">13        The principle of damages in contract is to

compensate the aggrieved party for the loss he suffers, based on the concept of <i>restitutio

in integram</i>, and not to give him any gain beyond such loss. Here, we would quote

Asquith LJ in <i>Victoria Laundry (Winsdor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd </i>[1949] 2 KB

528 at 539:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In cases of breach of contract, the aggrieved party is only

  entitled to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the

  contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach." </p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Often times, disputes on damages centre on two main areas: the question

of remoteness and the question of the measure of damages. The second question arises where

the losses which are suffered by the aggrieved party are not amenable to precise

determination. In the present case, none of these two questions arose.</p>
<p xmlns="">14        Before we conclude, we should mention that

in the trial judge’s written grounds of decision which she rendered later, she seemed

to have second thoughts about the correctness of her decision, caused no doubt in part by

the manner in which the various figures were presented to her. We would, for the reasons

given above, affirm that her decision was correct.</p>
